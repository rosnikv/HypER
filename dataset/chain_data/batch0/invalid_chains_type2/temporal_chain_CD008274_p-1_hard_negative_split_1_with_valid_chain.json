        "abstract": "Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health care professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women). Options: For people at risk for hypertension, there are a number of lifestyle options that may avert the condition \u2014 maintaining a healthy body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, exercising, reducing sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium, and reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce the risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the options for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification, antihypertensive medications or a combination of these options; with no treatment, these people remain at risk for the complications of hypertension. Outcomes: The health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure and in morbidity and mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence, no economic outcomes were considered. Evidence: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1966 to September 1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors were used to identify other studies. All relevant articles were reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to level of evidence. Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular morbidity and prema-ture death caused by untreated hypertension. costs: Lifestyle modification by means of weight loss (or maintenance of healthy body exercise and low alcohol consumption will the blood pressure of appropriately selected normotensive and hypertensive people.

        "abstract": "AbstractA structured hypertension treatment and education programme (HTEP) was developed in the Dusseldorf area in the 1990s for patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension and was found to be effective in a randomised controlled trial. The German Association of Diabetes Education and Counselling Professions (VDBD) implemented the HTEP all over Germany in order to optimise the care of patients with diabetes and hypertension. The objectives of the HTEP are to enable patients to gain knowledge of hypertension, to participate actively in their treatment to improve blood pressure (BP) and metabolic control and to self-measure their BP.The implementation consisted of two stages. The first stage comprised the training of 312 diabetes counsellors (DCs). During the second stage 473 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and hypertension in 35 diabetes centres throughout Germany received the HTEP including instructions in BP self-measurement. The HTEP consists of four units each one with a duration of 90 min...",

        "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a follow\u2011up program on blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients. \nDesign: A time series (one group pretest\u2011posttest) quasi\u2011experimental study was used. \nSetting: This study was conducted at the Hypertension, Obesity and Diabetes Center of a State Hospital in Turkey. \nSubjects: Forty\u2011five (45) hypertensive patients were recruited. \nIntervention: An education program was implemented with hypertensive patients whereby patients were monitored at each month for a total of six times following an initial appointment. Follow\u2011up by nurses included checking weight and blood pressure (BP), reviewing of diaries, education, counseling or referrals to other disciplines. \nMeasurement: Patients\u2019 BP and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed at the baseline and six months later. The findings were then compared to evaluate the effects of intervention on the patient\u2019s BP and cardiovascular risk factors. \nResults: After intervention there was a significant decrease between the mean systolic BP and diastolic BP when compared with the baseline. BMI was decreased from 29.6\u00b13kg/m2 to 29.3\u00b13kg/m2 (p=0.033). Total cholesterol did not change. Triglycerides decreased. However, LDL\u2011cholesterol increased and HDL\u2011cholesterol decreased. \nConclusion: To manage hypertension and to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, a program is needed and should be implemented which includes antihypertensive treatment options, lifestyle changes and lipid\u2011lowering drug therapy. The long-term effects of such a program should be monitored while implementing.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Hypertension and dyslipidemia are widely recognized a major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the nursing intervention on cholesterol level and quality of life (QOL) among hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia. Methods: Design: A quasi -experimental pre-post-test design was used to achieve the aim of the study. The study was conducted in the University Hospital at Shebin El-kom District, Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Purposeful sample of 100 hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia on treatment from the previous mentioned setting. Instruments: (1) structured interview questionnaire to assess socio-demographic data, risk factors of hypertension and dyslipidemia and patient\u2019s knowledge about hypertension and dyslipidemia; (2) Physiological measurement to assess blood pressure, weight and cholesterol level; (3) QOL scale to assess healthful lifestyle. Results: The main findings of the study there was statistically significant improvement of total knowledge related to hypertension and dyslipidemia, and there was statistically significant reduction in blood pressure and cholesterol level post-intervention than pre-intervention. Conclusions: The nursing intervention has a positive effect on blood pressure, cholesterol level and QOL of hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia. Recommendations: The nursing intervention that includes of adherence to diet regimen, prescribed medication and performing physical exercise, stress management, assertiveness training should be integrated into medical outpatient clinic to assist patients diagnosed with hypertension to cope with their illness and improve the QOL of hypertensive patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Hypertension is affecting 40.8% of females 38.7% of males in Egypt, and the total is affecting 39.7% of the population. High prevalence of hypertension connected to a wide range of severe medical disorders. Aim: to measure the outcomes of patients' instructions effects about modifiable risk factors for hypertensive patients on their attitude, and lipid profile. Subjects and Methods: A quasi-experimental design with one group pre, post, and follow-up was utilized to achieve the aim of the study. Sample: a convenience sample including 100 adult patients enrolled in this study. Setting: a study was conducted in cardiac and internal medicine outpatient clinics at Zagazig University Hospital and Beni-suef University hospital. Tools: The researchers prepared an interview form including three sections: I- Questionnaire to Patient Interview Questionnaire Sheet include Part 1: Assess patients\u2019 demographic characteristics Part 2: Assess Patient 's family, past and recent medical history, assess the associated chronic disease, medications, allergies and previous source of health knowledge. Part 3: Patient's Physical Assessment and Laboratory Investigation Sheet. II- The lifestyle attitude assessment. Results: the present study showed that more than have of the study sample have 50+years, female, have work, secondary school, their blood pressure, lipid profile, blood glucose reading decreased at the follow-up with highly statistically significant,marked changes of lifestyle with highly statistically significant difference among study phases in all items except in exercise . also in knowledge, levels, and medical examination, there is Correlation between lipid profile and level of practice, Correlation between lab investigation and level of knowledge. Conclusions: study concluded that personalized, tailored nursing instructions could be adjusted blood pressure through improving hypertensive patients' attitude and normalize lipid profile. Therefore, the confident effect of the program is lifelong. Recommendations: study recommended nursing instructions should apply in various outpatients' cardiac clinics and medical service centers and training of nurses to provide this service.
