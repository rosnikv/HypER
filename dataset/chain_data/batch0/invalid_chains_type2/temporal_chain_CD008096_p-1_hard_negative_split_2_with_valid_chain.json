        "abstract": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have largely replaced nasogastric tubes (NGT) for nutritional support of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing curative (chemo)radiotherapy without any good scientific basis. A randomized trial was conducted to compare PEG tubes and NGT in terms of nutritional outcomes, complications, patient satisfaction and cost. The study was closed early because of poor accrual, predominantly due to patients\u2019 reluctance to be randomized. There were 33 patients eligible for analysis. Nutritional support with both tubes was good. There were no significant differences in overall complication rates, chest infection rates or in patients\u2019 assessment of their overall quality of life. The cost of a PEG tube was 10 times that of an NGT. The duration of use of PEG tubes was significantly longer, a median 139\u2003days compared with a median 66\u2003days for NGT. We found no evidence to support the routine use of PEG tubes over NGT in this patient group.",

        "abstract": "Objective To understand the impact of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement timing on tube duration, weight loss, and disease control in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Setting A tertiary academic center. Study Design Historical cohort study. Subjects and Methods Seventy-four patients with HNC were reviewed. Patients underwent cisplatinum-based chemoradiation therapy with or without surgical resection. They received a PEG tube either before radiation therapy began (prophylactic) or after (reactive). Patients were matched on the basis of age, gender, TNM stage, tumor subsite, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and chemoradiation dose. Results Patients receiving reactive PEG tubes had them in place for fewer days than those placed prophylactically (227 vs 139 days, P < .01). There was no difference in percentage weight loss at 2, 6, or 12 months. There was no difference in survival or disease control between the groups. Conclusions Reactive PEG tube placement may afford patients a shorter duration of usage without incurring greater weight loss or poorer oncologic outcomes.",

        "title": "Nutritional Interventions in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy: A Narrative Review",
        "abstract": "The present review aimed to define the role of nutritional interventions in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in HNC patients undergoing CRT as well as their impact on CRT-related toxicity and survival. Head and neck cancer patients are frequently malnourished at the time of diagnosis and prior to the beginning of treatment. In addition, chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) causes or exacerbates symptoms, such as alteration or loss of taste, mucositis, xerostomia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, with consequent worsening of malnutrition. Nutritional counseling (NC) and oral nutritional supplements (ONS) should be used to increase dietary intake and to prevent therapy-associated weight loss and interruption of radiation therapy. If obstructing cancer and/or mucositis interfere with swallowing, enteral nutrition should be delivered by tube. However, it seems that there is not sufficient evidence to determine the optimal method of enteral feeding. Prophylactic feeding through nasogastric tube or percutaneous gastrostomy to prevent weight loss, reduce dehydration and hospitalizations, and avoid treatment breaks has become relatively common. Compared to reactive feeding (patients are supported with oral nutritional supplements and when it is impossible to maintain nutritional requirements enteral feeding via a NGT or PEG is started), prophylactic feeding does not offer advantages in terms of nutritional outcomes, interruptions of radiotherapy and survival. Overall, it seems that further adequate prospective, randomized studies are needed to define the better nutritional intervention in head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "With scientific advances allowing for the safe delivery of parenteral and enteral nutrition in the home setting, challenges have risen with determining how this will be financially feasible for patients. In the United States, the government is one of the major payers for home parenteral and enteral nutrition (HPEN). Thus, it is important for nutrition providers to have an understanding of the Medicare criteria that must be met in order for these services to be covered. It can be difficult for clinicians to sift through these requirements and decipher for whom and when HPEN is covered. As our nutrition science knowledge and delivery continue to grow and evolve, potential barriers to this coverage may arise. This article provides background on those currently on HPEN in the United States, the current Medicare HPEN coverage criteria, and challenges we may face in the future.",

        "title": "Challenges and Obstacles of Long\u2010Term Home Parenteral Nutrition",
        "abstract": "Patients receiving long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and clinicians managing their care face complex challenges not fully addressed by existing clinical practice guidelines. This review aims to increase awareness of some of the challenges encountered when managing patients receiving HPN and provide strategies for management. The ability to optimally manage these patients starts with involvement of a qualified team of clinicians, which is sometimes difficult to find. There are unique challenges related to the parenteral nutrition (PN) prescribing and compounding process that are not typically encountered with inpatient use. Clear communication is required between the HPN prescriber/team and the home infusion pharmacist to prevent errors related to misinterpretation of the order and PN product shortages. Dependency on HPN and living with chronic disease create a number of psychosocial, financial, and other lifestyle restrictions that can negatively impact a patient's quality of life. HPN nonadherence is a challenge that complicates the clinician's ability to accurately assess and make appropriate adjustments to therapy. HPN adherence may be improved by incorporating a patient-centered approach to care that allows patients to prioritize those issues most meaningful and valuable to them. Patient-centered care also encourages self-care and relies on a high level of HPN education. Clinicians are encouraged to use an interactive interview style when engaging patients to prioritize goals of care and make self-motivated decisions for change. In spite of challenges, HPN therapy has allowed patients the ability to maintain adequate nutrition and thrive in the home setting when the oral/enteral route fails.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nCentral line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a potentially life-threatening complication in home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients. We investigated potential predictors of CLABSI to determine a predictive model in a cohort of adult HPN patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients managed by the HPN service at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania on 1/1/2018 were included and followed through 6/30/2019, using existing medical records to collect demographic and clinical data. CLABSI were adjudicated prospectively by infectious disease experts. Variables with p\u22640.2 when comparing patients with CLABSI to those without were included in logistic regression models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the 114 patients, mean age was 54 \u00b1 16 years, 68% was female and BMI was 25 \u00b1 5.6. Median experience with HPN was 516 days (range 15-10,281) and 26% had history of CLABSI. The catheter types were PICC (72.6%), tunneled (23.9%), and implanted (3.5%). The incidence of CLABSI was 0.89/1000 catheter days. One multivariate model identified ostomy/wound (OR 22.0, 95%CI = 4.8-101.7), tunneled/implanted catheter (OR = 4.4; 95%CI = 1.4-13.9), and BMI < 18.5 (OR = 5.9; 95%CI = 1.4-24.2) as predictors of CLABSI. A second model identified patients with 2 potential predictors (OR 22.9, 95% CI = 5.6-93.5) and tunneled/implanted catheter (OR = 6.7; 95% = CI 2.1-21.8) at high risk of CLABSI.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn adult HPN patients, the presence of ostomy or wound, use of tunneled or implanted catheter, and low BMI were associated with CLABSI. Whether CLABSI rates might be reduced by more intense training (in wound or catheter care) especially for those with multiple predictors, different type of catheter, or malnutrition will require further study.

        "abstract": "Transitions of care require coordination between inpatient healthcare providers, care managers, outpatient/ambulatory providers, and the patient/caregiver and family members. Poor communication during transitions of care can affect health outcomes and economic costs for patients/caregivers, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems. The goal of this paper is to identify risk-prone processes in the transition of care for patients requiring parenteral nutrition (PN) between healthcare environments, including the hospital, home, skilled nursing facility, and long-term acute care hospital settings. To facilitate the evaluation of the transition, a sequential series of steps in the transition process were identified: initial notification, assessment in preparation for transfer, identifying the receiving organization, identifying accountable providers at each sending/receiving organization, communicating the nutrition care plan, implementing the plan and additional considerations regarding PN preparation and readmissions. Safety concerns with risk-prone processes are identified and recommended best practices are proposed for improving processes at each step of the transition. Pediatric considerations are included in the evaluation of the various steps in the transition of care.

        "title": "Parenteral nutrition at home/long-term parenteral nutrition",
        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Some diseases require that patients receive parenteral nutrition (PN) over a prolonged time period. Long-term administration of PN can further complicate an already complex therapy, posing additional risk of potential complications. This article is based on presentations and discussions held at the International Safety and Quality of PN Summit, providing insights into aspects of home PN (HPN) and examples of good HPN practice. Summary One critical step in the HPN process is when patients transition from a hospital to a home setting, and vice versa. Generally, electronic PN ordering is not feasible in an HPN setting, leading to potential difficulties in communication and coordination. HPN requires that patients (or their home caregivers) administer PN, and thus their education and competency are crucial. Likewise, the choice of PN formulation is of great importance. For example, using more modern intravenous lipid emulsions containing medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and/or fish oil can provide benefits in terms of liver function during long-term HPN. Internationally, there are wide variations in delivery of HPN, with compounded PN dominating in some countries while others make greater use of market-authorized multichamber bags (MCBs). Patient-related factors, institutional considerations, and the availability of different MCB formulations, are also contributing factors guiding formulation and delivery system preferences. Conclusion Education and communication remain key components of a successful HPN process. The information shared here may help to motivate efforts to improve HPN processes and to consider the often-differing perspectives of patients and their healthcare professionals.",
