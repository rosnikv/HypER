        "title": "Combining infliximab with methotrexate for the induction and maintenance of remission in refractory Crohn's disease: a controlled pilot study",
        "abstract": "Objectives Immunosuppression of chronic active Crohn's disease resistant or intolerant to purine antimetabolites still remains a clinical challenge. To obtain long-lasting effects with the anti-TNF-&agr; antibody infliximab repeated infusions are often required. Methotrexate has been shown to be a moderately effective drug in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the combination of infliximab and methotrexate as therapy for refractory Crohn's disease. Methods Nineteen patients with chronic active Crohn's disease resistant or intolerant to azathioprine were enrolled. Patients received either two infusions of infliximab (5\u2009mg/kg) alone (n=8) or in combination with long-term methotrexate at a dosage of 20\u2009mg/week (n=11) over 48 weeks. Results Two out of eight patients receiving infliximab monotherapy and four out of 11 patients treated with infliximab and concomitant methotrexate had discontinued study treatment by week 48, solely because of lack of efficacy. Clinical remission at week 48 was observed in five out of seven patients treated with infliximab and methotrexate, but only in two out of six patients receiving infliximab monotherapy. In addition, patients treated with concomitant methotrexate achieved remission earlier (median time 2 versus 18 weeks) and needed fewer steroids (median prednisolone dose 0 versus 11.8\u2009mg). Despite an increased mean number of adverse events per patient in the methotrexate group, the proportions of patients experiencing any adverse events and serious adverse events were similar across treatment groups. Conclusions The combination of infliximab with long-term methotrexate may be a promising concept in refractory Crohn's disease. Our data prompt larger trials.",

        "title": "Methotrexate Following Unsuccessful Thiopurine Therapy in Pediatric Crohn's Disease",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:The thiopurines, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are traditional first-line immunomodulatory agents in adult and pediatric Crohn's disease, but the comparative efficacy and safety of methotrexate have seldom been examined. We report outcomes with methotrexate treatment in pediatric patients previously refractory to or intolerant of thiopurines.METHODS:In a four-center, retrospective cohort study, efficacy of methotrexate in maintaining remission was assessed by PCDAI measurements, steroid use, and height velocity. Patients served as their own historical controls. Multivariable analysis controlled for route of methotrexate administration, reason for thiopurine discontinuation, baseline disease activity, and disease duration.RESULTS:Forty-two percent of 60 children treated with methotrexate were in clinical remission without steroids at both 6 and 12 months. A strong steroid sparing effect was observed compared with the year prior to methotrexate (P < 0.001). Success rates were similar in previously thiopurine-intolerant and refractory patients. Height velocity increased from \u20131.9 SDS to \u20130.14 SDS (P = 0.004) in the year following therapy. In a median 3-yr follow-up, a third of the patients did not require escalation of therapy; the others required step-up therapy with infliximab or surgery. Eight children (13%) stopped methotrexate due to adverse events, including, most commonly, elevated liver enzymes, and one serious episode of sepsis.CONCLUSION:Methotrexate appears effective in maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease, when thiopurines have failed. Consideration should be given to its use earlier in pediatric treatment algorithms.",

        "title": "Growth Retardation in Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Should We Monitor and Treat These Patients Differently?",
        "abstract": "Growth impairment and associated pubertal delay are common complications of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Chronic undernutrition (related primarily to inadequate intake) and pro-inflammatory cytokines are the two major and interrelated contributory factors. Pathogenic mechanisms include interference with growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, with gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion patterns, and direct cytokine effects on growing bone. Chronic corticosteroid therapy compounds disease-related causes of growth impairment. The influence on growth of polymorphisms in IBD susceptibility or modifier genes is under study. Accurate recognition of impaired growth requires appreciation of normal growth. Pre-illness standard deviation scores (SDS) for height should be obtained and compared with height SDS at diagnosis, so that the impact of disease on growth can be fully appreciated. The greater the deficit prior to recognition of IBD, the greater is the demand for catch-up growth. Height velocity should be regularly monitored and its adequacy for age and pubertal stage assessed. Restoration and maintenance of pre-illness growth pattern indicate success of therapy. Current treatment regimens limit use of corticosteroids, via optimization of immunomodulatory drugs, use of enteral nutrition in CD, and, if necessary, surgery for ulcerative colitis and for intestinal complications of localized CD. Biologic agents with the potential for mucosal healing hold promise of growth enhancement even among children, whose growth with previously available therapies remained compromised. For all therapies, there is a window of opportunity to achieve normal growth before puberty is too advanced.",

        "abstract": "&NA; Nearly a third of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients present in childhood or adolescence, with epidemiological and natural history studies clearly demonstrating a rising incidence in this population. Although early\u2010onset disease has a distinct phenotype, such as more extensive disease at onset and rapid progression, two recent genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) carried out exclusively in this age group have demonstrated marked genetic similarities to adult disease. Although these parallels exist, this review will focus on the novel regions associated with early\u2010onset IBD susceptibility identified by these early\u2010onset GWAS. These new loci reaffirm the dysregulated pathways previously implicated in adult IBD pathogenesis and provide further insight into the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation. The newly identified loci and expression data suggest mutations in genes encoding IL\u201027, which is involved in Th17 effector cell physiology; MTMR3, which we demonstrate is an essential component of autophagy; and CAPN10, which is necessary in regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the roles of PSMG1, TNFRSF6B, ZMIZ1 and SMAD3 are also discussed in relation to abnormal protein degradation and the secondary immune response. It is clear that with increasing technology our understanding of IBD pathogenesis is deepening at the genomic level and that the use of early patient selection coupled with ongoing work on therapeutic targets will lead to improved disease\u2010modifying treatments in the near future.

        "title": "Genetic association and functional role of Crohn disease risk alleles involved in microbial sensing, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress",
        "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified several genes implicated in autophagy (ATG16L1, IRGM, ULK1, LRRK2, and MTMR3), intracellular bacterial sensing (NOD2), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (XBP1 and ORMDL3) to be associated with Crohn disease (CD). We studied the known CD-associated variants in these genes in a large cohort of 3451 individuals (1744 CD patients, 793 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 914 healthy controls). We also investigated the functional phenotype linked to these genetic variants. Association with CD was confirmed for NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, MTMR3, and ORMDL3. The risk for developing CD increased with an increasing number of risk alleles for these genes (P < 0.001, OR 1.26 [1.20 to 1.32]). Three times as many (34.8%) CD patients carried a risk allele in all three pathways, in contrast to 13.3% of the controls (P < 0.0001, OR = 3.46 [2.77 to 4.32]). For UC, no significant association for one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found, but the risk for development of UC increased with an increasing total number of risk alleles (P = 0.001, OR = 1.10 [1.04 to 1.17]). We found a genetic interaction between reference SNP (rs)2241880 (ATG16L1) and rs10065172 (IRGM) in CD. Functional experiments hinted toward an association between an increased genetic risk and an augmented inflammatory status, highlighting the relevance of the genetic findings.",

Autophagy, the major lysosomal pathway for degrading and recycling cytoplasmic material, constitutes an important homeostatic cellular process. Of interest, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ATG16L1 (autophagy-related 16-like 1 [S. cerevisiae]), a key component in the autophagic response to invading pathogens, have been associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn disease. The most common and well-studied genetic variant of ATG16L1 (rs2241880; leading to a T300A conversion) exhibits a strong association with risk for developing Crohn disease. The rs2241880 variant plays a crucial role in pathogen clearance, resulting in imbalanced cytokine production, and is linked to other biological processes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response. In this review, we focus on the importance of ATG16L1 and its genetic variant (T300A) within the elementary biological processes linked to Crohn disease.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often metastasizes to the brain, but identifying which patients will develop brain metastases (BM) is difficult. Macroautophagy/autophagy is critical for cancer initiation and progression. We hypothesized that genetic variants of autophagy-related genes may affect brain metastases (BM) in NSCLC patients. We genotyped 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 7 autophagy-related (ATG) genes (ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, ATG12, ATG16L1, and MAP1LC3/LC3) by using DNA from blood samples of 323 NSCLC patients. Further, we evaluated the potential associations of these genes with subsequent BM development. Lung cancer cell lines stably transfected with ATG16L1: rs2241880 (T300A) were established. Mouse models of brain metastasis were developed using cells transfected with ATG16L1\u2013300T or ATG16L1\u2013300A. ATG10: rs10036653 and ATG16L1: rs2241880 were significantly associated with a decreased risk of BM (respective hazard ratios [HRs]=0.596, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.398\u20130.894, P = 0.012; and HR = 0. 655, 95% CI 0.438\u20130.978, P = 0.039, respectively). ATG12: rs26532 was significantly associated with an increased risk of BM (HR=1.644, 95% CI 1.049\u20132.576, P = 0.030). Invasion and migration assays indicated that transfection with ATG16L1\u2013300T (vs. 300A) stimulated the migration of A549 cells. An in vivo metastasis assay revealed that transfection with ATG16L1\u2013300T (vs. 300A) significantly increased brain metastasis. Our results indicate that genetic variations in autophagy-related genes can predict BM and that genome analysis would facilitate stratification of patients for BM prevention trials.",

        "abstract": "Although autophagy is reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, its correlation with the prognosis of glioma patients remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify prognostic autophagy-related genes, analyze their correlation with clinicopathological features of glioma, and further construct a prognostic model for glioma patients. After 139 autophagy-related genes were obtained from the GeneCards database, their expression data in glioma patients were extracted from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas database. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic autophagy-related genes. Ten hub autophagy-related genes associated with prognosis were identified. The autophagy risk score (ARS) was only positively correlated with histopathology (P = 0.000) and World Health Organization grade (P = 0.000). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the overall survival of patients with a high ARS was significantly worse than that of patients with a low ARS (hazard ratio = 1.59, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.03, P = 0.0001). In addition, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed several common biological processes and signaling pathways related to the 10 hub genes in glioblastoma. A prediction model was developed for glioma patients, which demonstrated high prediction efficiency on calibration. Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for 1-, 3- and 5-year survival probabilities were 0.790, 0.861, and 0.853, respectively. In conclusion, we identified 10 autophagy-related genes that can serve as novel prognostic biomarkers for glioma patients.

        "abstract": "Background Immunotherapy is an effective therapeutic approach for multiple human cancer types. However, the correlations between EVA1C and patients\u2019 prognosis as well as immune infiltration remain obscure. Herein, we employed transcriptomic and clinical data extracted from two independent databases to systematically investigate the role of EVA1C in the oncological context. Methods The differential expression of EVA1C was analyzed via TCGA and Oncomine databases. We evaluated the influence of EVA1C on clinical prognosis using Kaplan-Meier plotter. We then used the expression profiler to calculate stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score based on the ESTIMATE algorithm. The abundance of infiltrating immune cells was calculated via TIMER. The correlations between EVA1C expression and immune infiltration levels were analyzed in two independent cohorts. Results In patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II/III glioma, high EVA1C expression was associated with malignant clinicopathological features and poor overall survival in both cohorts. EVA1C expression was positively associated with immune infiltration levels of B cell, CD4+ T cell, neutrophil, macrophage, and dendritic cells (DCs). Besides, EVA1C expression strongly correlated with diverse immune marker sets. And the predictive power of EVA1C was better than that of other indicators in predicting high immune infiltration levels in glioma. Conclusions For the first time, we identified the overexpression of EVA1C in glioma, which was tightly correlated with the high infiltration levels of multiple immune cells as well as poor prognosis. Meanwhile, EVA1C might be a potential biomarker for predicting high immune infiltration in WHO grade II/III gliomas.",

However, little has been reported on C5AR2 in glioma. This study sought to explore its expression, biological function, and association with clinical pathological indicators, prognosis, and immune infiltration levels in glioma through glioma cohorts. Methods A cohort of 657 patients was screened from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). \u03c7 2 test was performed to calculate the difference of classified variables. Cox proportional hazard regression modeling was used to identify independent prognostic indicators of glioma patients. A survival plot was generated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The immune cell infiltration score of glioma patients was calculated by TIMER algorithm. Results We observed that high expression of C5AR2 was strongly associated with malignant clinical indicators in 657 patients with glioma, and patients with high C5AR2 expression had worse prognoses. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that C5AR2 could be a new independent prognostic indicator for glioma patients. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that C5AR2 overexpression correlated with multiple inflammatory and immune biological processes. Additionally, high C5AR2 expression was strongly associated with higher abundance and marker gene expression of multiple tumor immune cells in low\u2010grade glioma. Finally, a model was constructed to improve the prognostic evaluation of glioma patients. Conclusions The C5AR2 gene is highly expressed in gliomas and is significantly associated with clinical indicators of malignant progression in glioma patients. In glioma, patients with high C5AR2 expression displayed a worse outcome. In glioma tissues, the expression level of C5AR2 highly correlated with the abundance of tumor immune cell infiltration. Additionally, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that C5AR2 expression may be involved in a variety of immune and inflammatory biological processes.",
