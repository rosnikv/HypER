        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCollagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active collagenous colitis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nRelevant papers published between 1970 and January 2002 were identified via the MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nFour randomized trials were identified. One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), and 3 trials (2 published in abstract form only) studied budesonide in the therapy of collagenous colitis.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThere were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active drug were more likely to have clinical (p=0.003) and histological (p=0.003) improvement than those assigned to placebo. A total of 86 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 16.79 (95% CI 7.28-38.74), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is effective in the treatment of collagenous colitis. The evidence for bismuth subsalicylate is weaker, but still important. The roles of these and other therapies in inducing or maintaining remission (as opposed to clinical or histological improvement) of collagenous colitis are unknown.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe incidence of microscopic colitis has recently increased. Although collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are the two main subtypes of microscopic colitis, many patients may not fit into either category and are thus included under the header nonspecific colitis. Of late, the spectrum of microscopic colitis has widened to include minimal change colitis, microscopic colitis not otherwise specified and microscopic colitis with giant cells. There is a lack of information concerning the spectrum of microscopic colitis in Asia.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn a retrospective analysis, case records of 29 patients diagnosed with microscopic colitis between 1999-2005 were analysed. Drug use parasitic infection and common bacterial infections were excluded. Colonoscopic/ sigmoidoscopic examination was done and multiple colonic mucosal biopsies were stained serially with haematoxylin and eosin for detailed histological examination and Masson trichrome for sub-epithelial collagen band. Based on histological criteria, patients were categorised into five subtypes: collagenous colitis (presence of collagenous thickening of surface epithelium basement membrane > 10 microm), lymphocytic colitis (intra-epithelial lymphocytes more than 20 per 100 colonocytes), minimal change colitis (crypt architectural abnormality in the form of cryptitis and crypt dilatation in the absence of increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and subepithelial collagenous band), microscopic colitis not otherwise specified (increased inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lamina propria in the absence of other abnormalities) and microscopic colitis with giant cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean age of patients was 38.59 years (range 12-62). Of 29 patients with microscopic colitis, 7 (24.1%), 4 (13.8%), 7 (24.1%) and 11 (37.9%) were classified as collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, minimal change colitis and microscopic colitis not otherwise specified, respectively. None of these patients had giant cells. There was no significant correlation between disease type and clinical manifestations.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMicroscopic colitis has a wide histological spectrum. Cases reported as non-specific colitis, may be categorised into definite subtypes of microscopic colitis.",

        "abstract": "Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that has emerged in the last three decades as a leading cause of chronic watery diarrhoea. MC classically includes two main subtypes: lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis (CC). Other types of histopathological changes in the colonic mucosa have been described in patients with chronic diarrhoea, without fulfilling the conventional histopathological criteria for MC diagnosis. Whereas those unclassified alterations remained orphan for a long time, the use of the term incomplete MC (MCi) is nowadays universally accepted. However, it is still unresolved whether CC, LC and MCi should be considered as one clinical entity or if they represent three related conditions. In contrast to classical MC, the real epidemiological impact of MCi remains unknown, because only few epidemiological studies and case reports have been described. MCi presents clinical characteristics indistinguishable from complete MC with a good response to budesonide and cholestiramine. Although a number of medical treatments have been assayed in MC patients, currently, there is no causal treatment approach for MC and MCi, and only empirical strategies have been performed. Further studies are needed in order to identify their etiopathogenic mechanisms, and to better classify and treat MC.",

        "abstract": "Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with little in terms of endoscopic abnormalities and is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases. The peak incidence of the disease is in middle aged or older populations, mostly females. The pathogenesis of MC is complex, multifactorial and poorly understood. Current concepts revolve around innate immunity or microbiome alterations as well as gut barrier dysfunction, all of which lead to the development of subtle inflammatory lesions in gut mucosa. The results of numerous basic and clinical studies involving molecular techniques as well as advanced endoscopic imaging revealed the important role of both intrinsic (e.g., hormonal) as well as extrinsic (e.g., NSAIDs and PPIs) factors in the modulation of gastrointestinal microbiome and MC pathogenesis. Capsule endoscopy as well confocal endomicroscopy imaging, alongside standard endoscopic techniques offer new tools in the evaluation of MC patients and allow their better stratification for novel treatment protocols based on modulation of gut microbiome and barrier function.",

        "title": "Gut Inflammation Induced by Dextran Sulfate Sodium Exacerbates A \u03b2 Plaque Deposition in the App NL-G-F Mouse Model of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease",
        "abstract": "Background: Although it is known that the brain communicates with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract via the well-established gut-brain axis, the influence exerted by chronic intestinal inflammation on brain changes in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is not fully understood. We hypothesized that increased gut inflammation would alter brain pathology of a mouse model of AD. Methods: To test this idea, 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was dissolved in the drinking water and fed ad libitum to male C57BL/6 wild type and App NL-G-F mice at 6\u201310 months of age for two cycles of three days each. DSS is a negatively charged sulfated polysaccharide which results in bloody diarrhea and weight loss, changes similar to human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results: Both wild type and App NL-G-F mice developed an IBD-like condition. Brain histologic and biochemical assessments demonstrated increased insoluble A \u03b2 1\u201340/42 levels along with the decreased microglial CD68 immunoreactivity in DSS treated App NL-G-F mice compared to vehicle treated App NL-G-F mice. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that intestinal dysfunction is capable of altering plaque deposition and glial immunoreactivity in the brain. This study increases our knowledge of the impact of peripheral inflammation on A \u03b2 deposition via an IBD-like model system. App NL-G-F were of were for changes in during recovery and sacrificed 20 after last DSS exposure to investigate the long-lasting impact of gut inflammation on AD mouse brains. Our data demonstrated that chronic DSS administration decreased locomotion but not memory function and increased A \u03b2 plaque load correlating with decreased microglial phagocytic phenotype in the AD mouse model. the first study investigating a direct contribution of colitis-like intestinal inflammation to A \u03b2 plaque levels and glial immunoreactivity using the App NL-G-F transgenic mouse model. We have previously reported that colonic inflammation correlates with brain A \u03b2 plaque deposition starting at 3 months of age in App NL-G-F mice and increased pro-inflammatory markers and macrophages in the ileums of App NL-G-F and APP/PS1 mice compared to controls [34, 35]. In this study, we report that chronic intestinal disruption induced by 2 cycles of DSS exposure resulted in moderate colitis-like symptoms in WT and AD animals with significant motor dysfunction in App NL-G-F mice. Intestinal inflammation correlated with an increase in A \u03b2 plaque load in hippocampi and temporal cortices along with a decrease in microglial CD68 immunoreactivity in App NL-G-F mice during the recovery phase after injury. Taken together, these findings suggest that basal intestinal inflammation, which has been reported in our previous studies, exacerbated by DSS administration in AD animals can propagate to the brain and promote A \u03b2 plaque formation. Based upon the reduced CD68 immunoreactivity, it is intriguing to suggest that increased plaque accumulation may be due to reduced microglial phagocytic phenotype in App NL-G-F mice. Interestingly, induced gut inflammation altered microglial and astrocyte reactivity of WT mice brains uniquely from the App NL-G-F mice.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and is a leading cause of death in the United States. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the progression of AD, and several recent studies suggest that peripheral immune dysfunction may influence the disease. Continuing evidence indicates that intestinal dysbiosis is an attribute of AD, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been shown to aggravate cognitive impairment. Previously, we separately demonstrated that an IBD-like condition exacerbates AD-related changes in the brains of the AppNL-G-F mouse model of AD, while probiotic intervention has an attenuating effect. In this study, we investigated the combination of a dietary probiotic and an IBD-like condition for effects on the brains of mice. Male C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and AppNL-G-F mice were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle control, oral probiotic, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and DSS given with probiotics. As anticipated, probiotic treatment attenuated the DSS-induced colitis disease activity index in WT and AppNL-G-F mice. Although probiotic feeding significantly attenuated the DSS-mediated increase in WT colonic lipocalin levels, it was less protective in the AppNL-G-F DSS-treated group. In parallel with the intestinal changes, combined probiotic and DSS treatment increased microglial, neutrophil elastase, and 5hmC immunoreactivity while decreasing c-Fos staining compared to DSS treatment alone in the brains of WT mice. Although less abundant, probiotic combined with DSS treatment demonstrated a few similar changes in AppNL-G-F brains with increased microglial and decreased c-Fos immunoreactivity in addition to a slight increase in A\u03b2 plaque staining. Both probiotic and DSS treatment also altered the levels of several cytokines in WT and AppNL-G-F brains, with a unique increase in the levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-2 being observed in only AppNL-G-F mice following combined DSS and probiotic treatment. Our data indicate that, while dietary probiotic intervention provides protection against the colitis-like condition, it also influences numerous glial, cytokine, and neuronal changes in the brain that may regulate brain function and the progression of AD.",
