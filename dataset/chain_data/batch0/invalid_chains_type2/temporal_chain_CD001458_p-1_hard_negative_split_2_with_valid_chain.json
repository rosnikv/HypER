        "title": "Collaborative meta-analysis of randomised trials of antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in high risk patients",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCollaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective Little is known about the development of the quality of diabetes care in Germany. The aim of this study is to analyze time trends in patient self-management, physician-delivered care, medication, risk factor control, complications and quality of life from 2000 to 2014. Methods Analyses are based on data from individuals with type 2 diabetes of the population-based KORA S4 (1999\u20132001, n = 150), F4 (2006\u20132008, n = 203), FF4 (2013/14, n = 212) cohort study. Information on patient self-management, physician-delivered care, medication, risk factor control and quality of life were assessed in standardized questionnaires and examinations. The 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was calculated using the UKPDS risk engine. Time trends were analyzed using multivariable linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetes duration, and history of cardiovascular disease. Results From 2000 to 2014 the proportion of participants with type 2 diabetes receiving oral antidiabetic/cardio-protective medication and of those reaching treatment goals for glycemic control (HbA1c<7%, 60% to 71%, p = 0.09), blood pressure (<140/80 mmHg, 25% to 69%, p<0.001) and LDL cholesterol (<2.6 mmol/l, 13% to 27%, p<0.001) increased significantly. However, improvements were generally smaller from 2007 to 2014 than from 2000 to 2007. Modeled 10-year CHD risk decreased from 30% in 2000 to 24% in 2007 to 19% in 2014 (p<0.01). From 2007 to 2014, the prevalence of microvascular complications decreased and quality of life increased, but no improvements were observed for the majority of indicators of self-management. Conclusion Despite improvements, medication and risk factor control has remained suboptimal. The flattening of improvements and deteriorations in quality of (self-) care since 2007 indicate that more effort is needed to improve quality of care and patient self-management. Due to selection or lead time bias an overestimation of quality of care improvements cannot be ruled out.",

        "title": "Independent and opposite associations of serum levels of omentin-1 and adiponectin with increases of glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes in an older population: KORA F4/FF4 study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nCross-sectional studies found that higher levels of the novel adipokine omentin-1 were associated with higher adiponectin and lower levels of risk factors for type 2 diabetes, but its relevance for incident type 2 diabetes is currently not understood. Therefore this study investigated whether serum omentin-1 was associated with changes in glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes independently of adiponectin.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nThe study was based on participants aged 62-81 years from the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4/FF4 cohort. Associations of baseline serum levels of omentin-1 and adiponectin with changes in glycaemia were assessed in 471 non-diabetic participants, and associations between both adipokines and incident type 2 diabetes were assessed in 76 cases and 430 non-cases (follow-up time 6.5 years). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for multiple potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigher serum levels of omentin-1 were associated with increases in fasting glucose, 2-h glucose and HbA1c (all P\u2009<\u20090.001) and with incident type 2 diabetes (adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.40 (1.03; 1.90) per s.d. of log2-transformed omentin-1; P\u2009=\u20090.032). These associations were independent from adiponectin levels, which showed associations with changes in glycaemia and risk of type 2 diabetes in the opposite direction. We found no statistically significant interactions of omentin-1 with adiponectin or sex in the association with incident type 2 diabetes (all P\u2009>\u20090.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSystemic levels of omentin-1 were positively associated with increases in glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes in this older population. These associations were independent of potential confounders including adiponectin.",

        "title": "Increased Release of Proinflammatory Proteins in Primary Human Adipocytes and Activation of the Inflammatory NF\u0138B, p38, and ERK Pathways upon Omentin Treatment",
        "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the impact of omentin on the release of inflammation-related biomarkers and inflammatory pathways in primary human adipocytes. Methods: Adipocytes were treated with or without omentin (500 and 2,000 ng/mL), and the supernatants were analyzed for inflammation-related biomarkers using proximity extension assay technology. Potential upstream regulators of the omentin-stimulated proteins were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Protein levels of components of inflammatory pathways were measured using Western blotting. Results: 2,000 ng/mL omentin induced the release of 30 biomarkers 97.1 \u00b1 31.1-fold in the supernatants (all p < 0.05). Most biomarkers were proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. We identified the transcription factor nuclear factor \u201ckappa-light-chain-enhancer\u201d of activated B cells (NF\u0138B) and the kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 as potential upstream regulators in silico. On the cellular level, treatment with 2,000 ng/mL omentin for 24 h enhanced the phosphorylation levels of NF\u0138B 2.1 \u00b1 0.3-fold (p < 0.05), of p38 2.6 \u00b1 0.4-fold (p < 0.05), and of ERK1/2 1.8 \u00b1 0.2-fold (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These data argue that omentin exerts proinflammatory effects through the activation of the inflammatory NF\u0138B, p38, and ERK1/2 pathways in cultured primary adipocytes.",

        "title": "Adipokine levels and their association with clinical disease severity in patients with dengue",
        "abstract": "Adipokines have not been studied in acute dengue, despite their emerging role in inducing and regulating inflammation. Therefore, we sought to identify adipokine levels in patients with varying severities of acute dengue to understand their role in disease pathogenesis. We determined the levels of leptin, resistin, omentin, adiponectin, as well as IFNb, and NS1 using quantitative ELISA in patients with dengue fever (DF=49) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF=22) at admission (febrile phase) and at the time of discharge (recovery phase). The viral loads and serotypes of all samples were quantified using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Resistin levels (p =0.04) and omentin (p=0.006) levels were significantly higher in patients who developed DHF. Omentin levels in the febrile phase also correlated with the AST (Spearman's r=0.38, p=0.001) and ALT levels (Spearman's r=0.24, p=0.04); as well as serum leptin levels with both AST (Spearman's r=0.27, p=0.02) and ALT (Spearman's r=0.28, p=0.02). Serum adiponectin levels in the febrile phase did not correlate with any of the other adipokines or with liver enzymes, but inversely correlated with CRP levels (Spearman's r=-0.31, p=0.008). Although not significant (p=0.14) serum IFN{beta} levels were lower in the febrile phase in those who progressed to develop DHF (median 0, IQR 0 to 39.4 pg/ml), compared to those who had DF (median 37.1, IQR 0 to 65.6 pg.ml). The data suggest that adipokines are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of dengue, which should be further explored for the potential to be used as prognostic markers and as therapeutic targets.",
