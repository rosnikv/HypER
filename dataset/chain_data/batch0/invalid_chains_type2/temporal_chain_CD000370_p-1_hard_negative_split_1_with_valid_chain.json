        "title": "Safety of interferon \u03b2 treatment for chronic HCV hepatitis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In fact, chronic hepatitis C is considered as one of the primary causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the most common reason for liver transplantation. The primary objectives for the treatment of HCV-related chronic hepatitis is to eradicate infection and prevent progression of the disease. The treatment has evolved from the use of alpha-interferon (IFNalpha) alone to the combination of IFNalpha plus ribavirin, with a significant improvement in the overall efficacy, and to the newer PEG-IFNs which have further increased the virological response, used either alone or in combination with ribavirin. Despite these positive results, in terms of efficacy, concerns are related to the safety and adverse events. Many patients must reduce the dose of PEG-IFN or ribavirin, others must stop the treatment and a variable percentage of subjects are not suitable owing to intolerance toward drugs. IFNbeta represents a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and in some countries it plays an important role in therapeutic protocols. Aim of the present paper was to review available data on the safety of IFNbeta treatment in HCV-related chronic hepatitis. The rates of treatment discontinuation and/or dose modification due to the appearance of severe side effects during IFNbeta are generally low and in several clinical studies no requirements for treatment discontinuation and/or dose modifications have been reported. The most frequent side effects experienced during IFNbeta treatment are flu-like syndromes, fever, fatigue and injection-site reactions. No differences in terms of side-effect frequency and severity between responders and non-responders have been reported. A more recent study, performed to compare IFNbeta alone or in combination with ribavirin, confirmed the good safety profile of both treatments. Similar trends of adverse event frequency have been observed in subpopulations such as patients with genotype-1b HCV hepatitis unresponsive to IFNalpha treatment or with HCV-related cirrhosis and patients with acute viral hepatitis. If further studies will confirm the efficacy of combined IFNbeta and ribavirin treatment, this regimen could represent a safe and alternative therapeutic option in selected patients.",

IFN beta is a potential alternative to IFN alpha. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and durability of IFN beta and its combination with ribavirin in the na\u00efve setting of chronic hepatitis C in Asian patients. In the initial randomized, double\u2010blind phase, patients with chronic hepatitis C (n = 257) received 12 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a, 44 \u03bcg subcutaneously 3 times weekly, or a placebo. In the subsequent open\u2010label phase, placebo nonresponders received 24 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a plus ribavirin, whereas patients receiving IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy received an additional 12 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome variable was SVR, which was defined as negative HCV RNA after weeks 24 and 48. A total of 34 of 128 patients (26.6%) receiving IFN beta\u20101a achieved an SVR versus 0 of 129 patients (0%) receiving the placebo (P < 0.001). In the IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin group, 73 of 127 patients (57.5%) achieved an SVR [P < 0.001 versus IFN beta\u20101a; the adjusted odds ratio was 4.54 (95% confidence interval: 2.53, 8.13)]. In HCV genotype 1 patients, 37 of 80 patients (46.3%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin achieved an SVR versus 19 of 85 patients (22.4%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a (P = 0.001). Conclusion: IFN beta\u20101a produced a clear antiviral effect in Asian patients with chronic HCV infection.

        "abstract": "Background: With 170 million people infected worldwide and an inadequate current standard of care, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a major unmet medical need. Multiple companies are working on the discovery and development of specific HCV antiviral drugs, including inhibitors of HCV polymerase, protease and NS5A. Because of the error-prone nature of viral RNA replication, resistance mutants will develop that could present a potentially significant challenge to developing antiviral treatment regimens. Objective: Here, we review the major drug classes currently in preclinical and clinical development and the resistance mutations specific for each class that have been identified from cell culture and/or in vivo studies. Methods: We have analyzed currently available scientific literature to create a comprehensive review of the current state of the art in the field of HCV resistance to specific antiviral agents, in vitro and in vivo. Results/conclusion: Most specific HCV inhibitors described in the literature can select resistant viral variants in cell culture and in the clinic. Interplay of a mutant's fitness and its level of resistance will determine its clinical importance. Combinations of non-cross-resistant classes of dugs will be key to successful antiviral therapy. The number of drugs in a combination as well as the optimal duration of antiviral treatment, are important issues that need to be addressed in future studies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Asunaprevir (ASV; BMS-650032) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 when combined with alfa interferon and/or the NS5A replication complex inhibitor daclatasvir. ASV competitively binds to the NS3/4A protease complex, with Ki values of 0.4 and 0.24 nM against recombinant enzymes representing genotypes 1a (H77) and 1b (J4L6S), respectively. Selectivity was demonstrated by the absence of any significant activity against the closely related GB virus-B NS3 protease and a panel of human serine or cysteine proteases. In cell culture, ASV inhibited replication of HCV replicons representing genotypes 1 and 4, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) ranging from 1 to 4 nM, and had weaker activity against genotypes 2 and 3 (EC50, 67 to 1,162 nM). Selectivity was again demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC50, >12 \u03bcM) against a panel of other RNA viruses. ASV exhibited additive or synergistic activity in combination studies with alfa interferon, ribavirin, and/or inhibitors specifically targeting NS5A or NS5B. Plasma and tissue exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that ASV displayed a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 40- to 359-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were \u2265110-fold above the inhibitor EC50s observed with HCV genotype-1 replicons. Based on these virologic and exposure properties, ASV holds promise for future utility in a combination with other anti-HCV agents in the treatment of HCV-infected patients.",

        "abstract": "In a sentinel cohort, hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients (primarily genotype [GT] 1a) were treated with daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) and asunaprevir (NS3 protease inhibitor). Preexistence, emergence, and persistence of resistance variants in patients who failed this treatment are described. HCV\u2010infected null responders received daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and asunaprevir (600 mg twice daily) alone (Group A, 11 patients) or with peginterferon alfa\u20102a and ribavirin (Group B, 10 patients) for 24 weeks. Resistance testing was performed on baseline samples and samples with HCV RNA \u22651,000 IU/mL at Week 1 through posttreatment Week 48. Resistance substitution susceptibility to inhibition by asunaprevir and daclatasvir was assessed using HCV replicon assays. In Group A, six GT1a patients experiencing viral breakthrough and one GT1a patient who relapsed had detectable NS5A (Q30E/R, L31V/M, Y93C/N) and NS3 (R155K, D168A/E/V/Y) resistance\u2010associated variants at failure. Two of six viral breakthrough patients achieved SVR48 after treatment intensification with peginterferon alfa\u20102a and ribavirin. For 2/4 viral breakthrough patients not responding to treatment intensification, NS3 resistance variants changed (D168Y to D168T; R155K to V36M\u2010R155K). At posttreatment Week 48, daclatasvir\u2010resistant variants persisted while asunaprevir\u2010resistant variants were generally replaced by wild\u2010type sequences. The NS3 sequence remained unchanged in the one patient with NS3\u2010R155K at baseline, relapse, and posttreatment Week 48. In Group B, no viral breakthrough was observed. Conclusion: The treatment failure of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in HCV GT1a patients was associated with both NS5A and NS3 resistance variants in prior null responders. NS5A resistance variants persisted while NS3 resistance variants generally decayed, suggesting a higher relative fitness of NS5A variants. (Hepatology 2013;53:902\u2013911)",

The rate of sustained virologic response 24 weeks after treatment ranged from 88% to 100% across the arms of the 3D regimen with or without RBV; 20 GT1a-infected patients and 1 GT1b-infected patient experienced virologic failure (5.2%). Baseline resistance-conferring variants in NS3 were rare. M28V in GT1a and Y93H in GT1b were the most prevalent preexisting variants in NS5A, and C316N in GT1b and S556G in both GT1a and GT1b were the most prevalent variants in NS5B. Interestingly, all the GT1a sequences encoding M28V in NS5A were from the United States, while GT1b sequences encoding C316N and S556G in NS5B were predominant in the European Union. Variants preexisting at baseline had no significant impact on treatment outcome. The most prevalent treatment-emergent resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in GT1a were R155K and D168V in NS3, M28T and Q30R in NS5A, and S556G in NS5B. The single GT1b-infected patient experiencing virologic failure had no RAVs in any target. A paritaprevir-ritonavir dose of 150/100 mg was more efficacious in suppressing R155K in NS3 than a 100/100-mg dose. In patients who failed after receiving 12 or more weeks of treatment, RAVs were selected in all 3 targets, while most patients who relapsed after 8 weeks of treatment did so without any detectable RAVs. Results from this study guided the selection of the optimal treatment regimen, treatment duration, and paritaprevir dose for further development of the 3D regimen.

Although most treated patients achieve virological cure, HCV resistance to DAAs has an important role in the failure of interferon-free treatment regimens.

It is important to identify resistance patterns to select effective salvage treatments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a comprehensive analysis for resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in HCV genes (nonstructural protein [NS]3, NS5A, NS5B) targeted by DAAs. We compared NS3, NS5A, and NS5B sequences from 626 patients in Europe with DAA failure with sequences from 2322 DAA-na\u00efve patients, infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 4. We considered RASs to be relevant if they were associated with DAA failure in patients or conferred a greater than twofold change in susceptibility compared with a reference strain in in\u00a0vitro replicon assays. Data were collected on pretreatment status, DAA regimen, the treatment initiation date and duration, and virologic response. Patients who received at least 4 weeks of antiviral treatment were included in the analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRASs in NS3 associated with simeprevir or paritaprevir failure include R155K and D168E/V. In addition, several RASs were specifically associated with failure of simeprevir (Q80K/R in patients with genotype 1a or 4) or paritaprevir (Y56H in combination with D168V in patients with genotype 1b). Y93H in NS5A was the RAS most frequently associated with failure of daclatasvir, ledipasvir, or ombitasvir in patients with genotype 1b infection, and L31M was associated with failure of daclatasvir or ledipasvir, but not ombitasvir. RASs in NS5A were heterogeneous among patients with HCV genotype 1a or genotype 4 infections. In patients with HCV genotype 3, Y93H was associated with resistance to daclatasvir, but no RASs were associated with ledipasvir failure, pointing to a limited efficacy of ledipasvir in patients with genotype 3. Among patients failed by sofosbuvir-containing regimens, L159F was enriched in patients with genotype 1b (together with C316N) or genotype 3 infection, whereas the RAS S282T was rarely observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe compared RASs in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B among patients failed by DAA therapy.

        "abstract": "There is still limited data available from real-world experience studies on the pangenotypic regimens in patients with genotype (GT) 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and liver cirrhosis. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pangenotypic regimens in this difficult-to-treat population. A total of 236 patients with mean age 52.3 \u00b1 11.3 years and male predominance (72%) selected from EpiTer-2 database were included in the analysis; 72% of them were treatment-na\u00efve. The majority of patients (55%) received the combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), 71 without and 58 with ribavirin (RBV), whereas the remaining 107 individuals were assigned to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB). The effectiveness of the treatment following GLE/PIB and SOF/VEL regimens (96% and 93%) was higher compared to SOF/VEL + RBV option (79%). The univariate analysis demonstrated the significantly lower sustained virologic response in males, in patients with baseline HCV RNA \u2265 1,000,000 IU/mL, and among those who failed previous DAA-based therapy. The multivariate logistic regression analysis recognized only the male gender and presence of ascites at baseline as the independent factors of non-response to treatment. It should be emphasized that despite the availability of pangenotypic, strong therapeutic options, GT3 infected patients with cirrhosis still remain difficult-to-treat, especially those with hepatic impairment and DAA-experienced.",

        "title": "Are There Still Difficult-to-Treat Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C in the Era of Direct-Acting Antivirals?",
        "abstract": "Difficult-to-treat populations with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), in the era of interferon treatment, included patients with liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, treatment-experienced individuals, and those coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The current study aimed to determine whether, in the era of direct-acting antivirals (DAA), there are still patients that are difficult-to-treat. The study included all consecutive patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who started interferon-free therapy between July 2015 and December 2020 in the Department of Infectious Diseases in Kielce. The analyzed real-world population consisted of 963 patients, and most of them were infected with genotype 1 (87.6%) with the predominance of subtype 1b and were treatment-na\u00efve (78.8%). Liver cirrhosis was determined in 207 individuals (21.5%), of whom 82.6% were compensated. The overall sustained virologic response, after exclusion of non-virologic failures, was achieved in 98.4%. The univariable analysis demonstrated the significantly lower response rates in males, patients with liver cirrhosis, decompensation of hepatic function at baseline, documented esophageal varices, concomitant diabetes, body mass index \u226525, and previous ineffective antiviral treatment. Despite an overall very high effectiveness, some unfavorable factors, including male gender, genotype 3 infection, liver cirrhosis, and treatment experience, significantly reduce the chances for a virologic response were identified.",
