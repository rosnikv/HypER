        "abstract": "Albuminuria reduction could be renoprotective in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, the current use of renin-angiotensin-system intervention is targeted to BP only. Therefore, this study investigated the adequacy of this approach in 1428 patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy from the placebo-controlled Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. Investigated were the extent of discordance in treatment effects on systolic BP (SBP) and albuminuria and its association with renal outcome in a multivariate Cox model. Among patients with a reduced SBP during treatment, a lack of albuminuria reduction was observed in 37, 26, and 51% (total, losartan, and placebo, respectively) at month 6. SBP or albuminuria reduction was associated with a lower risk for ESRD, whereas combined SBP and albuminuria reduction was associated with the lowest risk for events. Across all categories of SBP change, a progressively lower ESRD hazard ratio was observed with a larger albuminuria reduction. A lower residual level of albuminuria was also associated with lower ESRD risk. In conclusion, changes in albuminuria are not concordant in a substantial proportion of patients when titrated for BP. Meanwhile, the ESRD risk showed a clear dependence on albuminuria reduction. The ESRD risk also showed dependence on the residual level of albuminuria, even in patients who reached the current SBP target. Antihypertensive treatment that is aimed at improving renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy may therefore require a dual strategy, targeting both SBP and albuminuria reduction.",

        "title": "Combination therapy with AT1 blocker and vitamin D analog markedly ameliorates diabetic nephropathy: Blockade of compensatory renin increase",
        "abstract": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, and blockade of the RAS is currently used for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. One major problem for the current RAS inhibitors is the compensatory renin increase, which reduces the efficacy of RAS inhibition. We have shown that vitamin D exerts renoprotective actions by transcriptionally suppressing renin. Here we demonstrated that combination therapy with an AT1 receptor blocker and a vitamin D analog markedly ameliorated renal injury in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model due to the blockade of the compensatory renin rise by the vitamin D analog, leading to more effective RAS inhibition. STZ-treated diabetic DBA/2J mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis within 13 weeks, accompanied by increased intrarenal production of angiotensin (Ang) II, fibronection, TGF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and decreased expression of slit diaphragm proteins. Treatment of the diabetic mice with losartan or paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2, an activated vitamin D analog) alone moderately ameliorated kidney injury; however, combined treatment with losartan and paricalcitol completely prevented albuminuria, restored glomerular filtration barrier structure, and markedly reduced glomerulosclerosis. The combined treatment suppressed the induction of fibronection, TGF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and reversed the decline of slit diaphragm proteins nephrin, Neph-1, ZO-1, and \u03b1-actinin-4. These were accompanied by blockade of intrarenal renin and Ang II accumulation induced by hyperglycemia and losartan. These data demonstrate that inhibition of the RAS with combination of vitamin D analogs and RAS inhibitors effectively prevents renal injury in diabetic nephropathy.",

        "title": "Vitamin D receptor attenuates renal fibrosis by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.",
        "abstract": "Analogs of vitamin D attenuate renal injury in several models of kidney disease, but the mechanism underlying this renoprotective effect is unknown. To address the role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in renal fibrogenesis, we subjected VDR-null mice to unilateral ureteral obstruction for 7 days. Compared with wild-type mice, VDR-null mice developed more severe renal damage in the obstructed kidney, with marked tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Significant induction of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen I), profibrogenic and proinflammatory factors (TGF-beta, connective tissue growth factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accompanied this histologic damage. Because VDR ablation activates the renin-angiotensin system and leads to accumulation of angiotensin II (AngII) in the kidney, we assessed whether elevated AngII in the VDR-null kidney promotes injury. Treatment with the angiotensin type 1 antagonist losartan eliminated the difference in obstruction-induced interstitial fibrosis between wild-type and VDR-null mice, suggesting that AngII contributes to the enhanced renal fibrosis observed in obstructed VDR-null kidneys. Taken together, these results suggest that the VDR attenuates obstructive renal injury at least in part by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.",

        "abstract": "There is increasingly evidence that the interactions between vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and klotho form an endocrine axis for calcium and phosphate metabolism, and derangement of this axis contributes to the progression of renal disease. Several recent studies also demonstrate negative regulation of the renin gene by vitamin D. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), low levels of calcitriol, due to the loss of 1-alpha hydroxylase, increase renal renin production. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), in turn, reduces renal expression of klotho, a crucial factor for proper FGF-23 signaling. The resulting high FGF-23 levels suppress 1-alpha hydroxylase, further lowering calcitriol. This feedback loop results in vitamin D deficiency, RAAS activation, high FGF-23 levels, and renal klotho deficiency, all of which associate with progression of renal damage. Here we examine current evidence for an interaction between the RAAS and the vitamin D-FGF-23-klotho axis as well as its possible implications for progression of CKD.",

        "abstract": "Elevations of circulating Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of renal failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Efforts to identify gene products whose transcription is directly regulated by FGF23 stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)/\u03b1-Klotho complexes in the kidney is confounded by both systemic alterations in calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism and intrinsic alterations caused by the underlying renal pathology in CKD. To identify FGF23 responsive genes in the kidney that might explain the association between FGF23 and adverse outcomes in CKD, we performed comparative genome wide analysis of gene expression profiles in the kidney of the Collagen 4 alpha 3 null mice (Col4a3\u2212/\u2212) model of progressive kidney disease with kidney expression profiles of Hypophosphatemic (Hyp) and FGF23 transgenic mouse models of elevated FGF23. The different complement of potentially confounding factors in these models allowed us to identify genes that are directly targeted by FGF23. This analysis found that \u03b1-Klotho, an anti-aging hormone and FGF23 co-receptor, was decreased by FGF23. We also identified additional FGF23-responsive transcripts and activation of networks associated with renal damage and chronic inflammation, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) signaling pathways. Finally, we found that FGF23 suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the kidney, thereby providing a pathway for FGF23 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. These gene products provide a possible mechanistic links between elevated FGF23 and pathways responsible for renal failure progression and cardiovascular diseases.",

        "title": "Childhood Obesity and Vitamin D Deficiency",
        "abstract": "The global escalation of childhood obesity and vitamin D deficiency are major public health issues. Both have been attributed to lifestyle changes. Obesity and vitamin D status are known to be associated, but the degree of linkage and whether it has any significance is unknown. Another important issue is the potential role of vitamin D in the development of the complications of obesity, because the health consequences of vitamin D deficiency in obese children and adolescents are not clear. This paper discussed the relationship between obesity and low vitamin D concentrations and its consequences, with reference to the possible underlying mechanisms. The global escalation of childhood obesity is a major public health issue. Despite a known genetic contribution, the increase in pediatric obesity has been attributed mainly to diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Another increasingly prevalent public health concern, probably caused mainly by the same lifestyle factors, is vitamin D deficiency. Both conditions are often associated, and many studies confirmed a high prevalence of the vitamin D deficiency in obese patients. In children and adolescents that are overweight and obese it affects approximately 60% in comparison to 20% of non obese subjects [1-4]. Moreover, an inverse correlation between body mass index, fat tissue content and vitamin D levels had been proven in many studies [1-5]. Obesity and vitamin D status are known to be associated, but the degree of linkage and whether it has any significance is unknown. A recently published metaanalysis of 21 adult cohorts (up to 42,024 participants) revealed that higher BMI lead to lower vitamin D level, while any effects of lower increasing BMI are likely to be small [5]. These results confirm, that vitamin D deficiency is a consequence, not a cause of obesity, and that it is rather impossible, that vitamin D supplementation may assist in preventing or treating obesity. The possible explanations of a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in obese children and adolescents might be lower, compared to non obese children, dietary intake, reduced cutaneous synthesis due to less exposure to the sun, altered metabolism and sequestration in the adipose tissue. Despite these hypotheses, it had been shown in an elegant study of 686 community-dwelling individuals that a volumetric dilutional model accounted essentially for all the variability in serum vitamin D concentrations attributable to obesity. Even though the factors described above may be operative, they are effectively \u2015captured by body weight. Once serum 25D concentrations in obese individuals are adjusted for body size, there is no longer a difference between obese and non-obese individuals [6,7]. Although the association between obesity and in consequence low vitamin D concentrations is therefore wellestablished, it remains uncertain what the health consequences of this might be. It has been suggested, that low vitamin D levels may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and subsequent metabolic alterations. A strong association between insulin resistance and an excess of fat tissue has been recognized for decades, but there is still confusion on what the risk factors are. One of the candidates is a low vitamin D level. Some authors have pointed to low vitamin D status as an important risk factor of insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism independent of body adiposity [1]. One of the possible explanations might be a potential anti-inflamatory role of vitamin D. Since the immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D are incontestable, its deficiency in obese patients may coincide with enhanced systemic inflammation. It has also been shown that low-grade inflammation is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. This theory has been supported by the results of a recently published pediatric study. The results showed an association between low vitamin D level, and activation of a pro-inflammatory, prodiabetic and atherogenic pathways in obese children. It might justify an attempt to inhibit this process and prevent or treat metabolic syndrome by vitamin D supplementation [4]. Despite these promising results, another study failed to demonstrate any reduction in systemic inflammatory markers in adult participants receiving 7000 IU oral vitamin D daily [8]. There is a clear need for adequately-powered, prospective interventions in pediatric populations. To date the role of vitamin D supplementation in obesity prevention has been uncertain. Novel insights into the potential contribution of vitamin D in the development of insulin resistance were possible after the discovery of FGF, especially FGF23 and its endocrine action [9]. It has been shown that FGF23 may play a key role in the early phase of the decrease in insulin sensitivity in obese adolescents [10,11]. It has the potential to act as a hormone, and is pivotal in the control of phosphate and Central Wojcik (2013) Email: malgorzata.wojcik@uj.edu.pl J Endocrinol Diabetes Obes 1(1): 1004 (2013) 2/2 vitamin D metabolism. However the exact mechanisms of the contribution of FGF23 to alterations in insulin metabolism in obese patients remains unclear, recent studies conducted on mice indicate that insulin signaling, or fat metabolism disturbances in the genetically ablated FGF23 subjects are mediated by vitamin D [12,13]. Some studies have pointed to the presence of low FGF23 levels in vitamin D deficient individuals, however it was not confirmed in larger groups [13]. Moreover, recent studies explicitly negate a simple correlation between vitamin D levels and insulin resistance in obese adolescents. They have shown that low vitamin D levels are one of the possible consequences of obesity rather than an independent risk factor of insulin resistance [2,3].",

        "abstract": "The work in this thesis addresses the interaction between the phosphate-regulating hormone Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) as key player in bone-mineral homeostasis and renal volume handling, mainly in the context of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). First, we elaborate on the role of vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its potential to increase effectiveness of RAAS-blockade. Next, we review the role of (excessive) sodium intake and why patients with CKD are particularly susceptible to the effects of sodium. Consecutively, we found that high FGF-23 levels are associated with an impaired antiproteinuric response to RAAS-blockade combined with a low sodium diet in patients with CKD. High FGF-23 concentrations are strongly associated with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality in CKD and hemodialysis patients. We add to this that also in renal transplant recipients high FGF-23 concentrations are correlated with adverse cardiovascular events, independent of existing, established risk factors. Moreover, FGF-23 levels correlated with markers of high volume status as NT-proBNP and copeptin. FGF-23 levels are extremely high in end stage renal disease. We found that part of the variance in these levels can be explained by ultrafiltration volume: patients who need more fluid withdrawal in dialysis, have far higher FGF-23 levels. The aforementioned chapters strongly suggest a link between volume status and FGF-23. We tested whether volume interventions, i.e. infusion of 2L saline or a 6-week sodium restriction, could in turn affect FGF-23 levels, this seems not to be the case. Although sodium interventions do not change FGF-23 concentrations, interventions aimed at phosphate intake do. Therefore, we examined the relation between these two minerals. Sodium intake and phosphate intake, as assessed by 24h-excretion, are strongly and robustly correlated across different populations: in renal transplant recipients, but also in diabetes patients and healthy volunteers. We interpret these findings in line with the observation that food products rich in sodium are also rich in phosphate. For example, processed-foods are notorious for their high sodium content, but they also contain a lot of phosphate-based additives which is far less commonly known. Expanding on healthy components of a healthy diet, we next investigate potassium. Healthy food choices as fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium. Following the observation that potassium supplementation appears to increase serum phosphate level, we hypothesized that potassium may lower FGF-23 levels. We confirmed this in the KaNa trial, where participants received potassium supplements or placebo combined with a fully-controlled diet. Several of our findings advocate changes in dietary intake, however this is difficult to achieve. In the multicenter, randomized controlled trial SUBLIME we deployed an approach that combined E-health technology based on self-regulation (behavioral change) theory, group meetings and individual coaching and we discuss the first results and feedback from participants in this thesis. In conclusion, this thesis places FGF-23 firmly as a bridge between sodium-volume and bone-mineral (phosphate) homeostasis.",
