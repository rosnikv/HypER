        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

        "abstract": "SIR, In their recent paper Mufioz-Gomez et al' suggested that localised synovial amyloidosis might be peculiar to chronic renal failure treated with periodical haemodialysis, and they made the assumption that it was the cause of an arthropathy. In fact localised amyloid deposition in synovium and also in articular cartilage is a common aging phenomenon2 apparently associated with osteoarthrosis, and it is relevant that four of the seven patients studied were aged 50 years or more. This type of aging deposit was actually referred to in the preceding editorial as 'joint capsule and articular cartilage' deposition.] The nature and extent of synovial amyloid deposits described in the article did not appear to differ from those associated with aging, and I would suggest that the finding of such deposits may represent no more than an accelerated age change. It is of interest in this context that synovial and articular cartilage amyloid deposits in patients with the so called amyloid arthropathy syndrome of multiple myeloma and primary amyloidosis do not appear to differ qualitatively from aging deposits either.4 Such patients may, however, show gross soft tissue amyloid deposition around joints. The finding of synovial amyloid deposits in chronic haemodialysis patients may be unrelated to any arthropathy present and should not prevent other causes for an arthropathy from being sought.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Superantigens (SAgs) have the capacity of stimulating T cells polyclonally. The only requirement for T cells to respond is the expression of particular T-cell receptor (TCR) VP elements (Fleischer & Schrezemeier 1988, MacDonald et al. 1988, White et al. 1989). Any SAg can, therefore, stimulate between 1% and 40% ofthe total T-cell repertoire, with a wide range of peptide specificities. SAgs have the capacity of binding tightly to MHC class II molecules and are, because of the restricted distribution of these molecules, presented mostly by classical antigenpresenting cells (Held et al. 1994, MacDonald et al. 1993). They are produced by bacteria {Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia and Mycoplasma) as exotoxins, by viruses (rabies and cytomegalovirus) as components of the viral particle and by retroviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV) where they are produced after integration of the reverse transcribed genome into the host DNA (AchaOrbea & MacDonald, 1995). Autoreactivity in the absence of autoimmunity is more the rule than the exception. Autoreactive T and B cells can be easily isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals (He et al. 1993, Hohlfeld et al. 1984, Wucherpfennig et al. 1991). In experimental animals, autoimmunity can be induced by injection of autoantigens or can occur spontaneously in certain strains (see below). The discovery of SAgs immediately raised attractive models for the induction of autoimmunity, since the polyclonal activation of T and B cells by SAgs does not distinguish between autoimmune and normal lymphocytes. This activation might break the delicate balance of tolerance. After SAg encounter, a polyclonal activation of T cells occurs, which is usually",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

The PPIase activity was completely inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). The inhibitor of FK506-binding proteins, rapamycin, had no effect on the PPIase activity, indicating that the PPIase activity in rabbit blastocysts originates from cyclophilins. Using CsA affinity chromatography, only one cyclophilin with a molecular mass of about 17.8 kDa was separated. The cDNA of rabbit cyclophilin was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the 682-base pair cDNA revealed an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 164 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 17.83 kDa. Homologies of 90% and 96% for the cDNA and amino acid sequence, respectively, to the human CyP18 were found, suggesting that the novel rabbit cyclophilin is a member of the CyP18 family (rabCyP18). The transcription level of rabCyP18 mRNA was 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 pg in 100 ng total RNA in noncultured blastocysts. In vitro culture with moderate oxygen stress (20% O2) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in rabCyP18 transcription and an increased PPIase activity compared to that of blastocysts cultured with 5% O2. Increase in transcription rate and PPIase activity by oxygen stress suggests an involvement of CyP18 in oxygen defense in rabbit preimplantation embryos.",

Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

Recent data provide evidence that low levels of KAI1 mRNA in LNCaP cells are caused by binding of beta-catenin/Reptin complexes to a specific motif in the proximal promoter, which prevents binding of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to the same motif, thus inhibiting transcription. Here, we explored a pathway by which phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) up-regulates KAI1 transcription in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Pretreatment with specific inhibitors showed that induction of KAI1 by PMA uses classic isoforms of protein kinase C (cPKC), is independent of Ras and Raf, and requires activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but does not involve p38MAPK. Induction of KAI1 transcription by PMA was associated with enhanced overall acetylation of histones H3 and H4, but only acetylation of H3 was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that PMA induces recruitment of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to NFkappaB-p50 motifs in the proximal promoter, and this was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. These changes were not associated with differences in overall levels of Tip60, Pontin, beta-catenin, or Reptin protein expression but with PMA-induced nuclear translocation of Tip60.",

Because the migratory paths of DCs are largely governed by the chemokine receptor CCR7, which is expressed on DCs upon maturation by proinflammatory stimuli, we examined the quantitative contribution of CCR7-dependent DC migration in the context of tuberculosis. We found that early trafficking of DCs from the lungs to the MDLN depended on CCR7-mediated signaling, but alternative mechanism(s) are used later in infection. Impaired migration of DCs in CCR7\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in delayed dissemination of bacteria to MDLN and spleen and in delayed kinetics of activation of adoptively transferred Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to control mice, we found that naive Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells are activated to proliferate in the lungs of CCR7\u2212/\u2212 mice and, when infected with higher doses of bacteria, resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in CCR7\u2212/\u2212 mice is compromised compared with wild-type mice.",

        "title": "Lung Neutrophils Facilitate Activation of Naive Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection",
        "abstract": "Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node and requires transport of M. tuberculosis by migratory dendritic cells (DCs) to the local lymph node. The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

        "title": "Immune Vulnerability of Infants to Tuberculosis",
        "abstract": "One of the challenges faced by the infant immune system is learning to distinguish the myriad of foreign but nonthreatening antigens encountered from those expressed by true pathogens. This balance is reflected in the diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines by both innate and adaptive immune cells in the infant. A downside of this bias is that several factors critical for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection are significantly restricted in infants, including TNF, IL-1, and IL-12. Furthermore, infant T cells are inherently less capable of differentiating into IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells. As a result, infected infants are 5\u201310 times more likely than adults to develop active tuberculosis (TB) and have higher rates of severe disseminated disease, including miliary TB and meningitis. Infant TB is a fundamentally different disease than TB in immune competent adults. Immunotherapeutics, therefore, should be specifically evaluated in infants before they are routinely employed to treat TB in this age group. Modalities aimed at reducing inflammation, which may be beneficial for adjunctive therapy of some forms of TB in older children and adults, may be of no benefit or even harmful in infants who manifest much less inflammatory disease.",

        "abstract": "Studies of tumor-infiltrating immune cells have revealed that immune escape plays an important role in tumor growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of metastasis affecting CD4+ T cell subsets in human clinical samples. Single-cell suspensions derived from tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) and primary cancer specimens were assessed by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In the CD4+ T cell subsets detected in TDLN, effector T cells (TE) in metastatic TDLN (mTDLN) was significantly lower than that in metastatic-free TDLN (mfTDLN). TE in mfTDLN were increased compared with normal controls. Similarly, effector memory T cells (TEM) in mTDLN was significantly lower than in control and mfTDLN. There was a significantly positive correlation between the proportion of TEM in TDLN and number of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Th1 to Th2 ratio was lower in mTDLN, and Treg in mTDLN was significantly higher than in mfTDLN. CD4+ T cell and TE subsets in TDLN were significantly affected by metastasis. Immunosuppressive cells exhibit increased migration to TDLN, in which a subset of CD4+ TE is skewed towards immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Infection of C57BL/6 mice with most Leishmania major strains results in a healing lesion and clearance of parasites from the skin. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain (LmSd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, LmSd elicited early upregulation of IL\u20101\u03b2 mRNA and IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin. Mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, or caspase\u20101/11, or lacking IL\u20101\u03b2 or IL\u20101 receptor signaling, developed healing lesions and cleared LmSd from the infection site. Mice resistant to LmSd had a stronger antigen\u2010specific Th1 response. The possibility that IL\u20101\u03b2 might act through neutrophil recruitment to locally suppress immunity was supported by the healing observed in neutropenic Genista mice. Secretion of mature IL\u20101\u03b2 by LmSd\u2010infected macrophages in vitro was dependent on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome and caspase\u20101. These data reveal that Nlrp3 inflammasome\u2010dependent IL\u20101\u03b2, associated with localized neutrophil recruitment, plays a crucial role in the development of a nonhealing form of cutaneous leishmaniasis in conventionally resistant mice.",

        "abstract": "The origin and functional specialization of dermal macrophages in cutaneous infections have been little studied. In this paper, we show that a strain of Leishmania major (L. major Seidman [LmSd]) that produces nonhealing cutaneous lesions in conventionally resistant C57BL/6 mice was more efficiently taken up by M2-polarized bone marrow (BM)\u2013derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro and by mannose receptor (MR)hi dermal macrophages in vivo compared with a healing strain (L. major Friedlin V1). Both in steady and in T helper type 1 (Th1) cell\u2013driven inflammatory states, the MRhi dermal macrophages showed M2 characteristics. The dermal macrophages were radio resistant and not replaced by monocytes or adult BM-derived cells during infection, but were locally maintained by IL-4 and IL-10. Notably, the favored infection of M2 BMDMs by LmSd in vitro was MR dependent, and genetic deletion of MR or selective depletion of MRhi dermal macrophages by anti\u2013CSF-1 receptor antibody reversed the nonhealing phenotype. We conclude that embryonic-derived, MRhi dermal macrophages are permissive for parasite growth even in a strong Th1-immune environment, and the preferential infection of these cells plays a crucial role in the severity of cutaneous disease.",

The costs and the side effects of current treatments render imperative the development of new therapies that are affordable and easy to administrate. Topical treatment would be the ideal option for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. MF29 is a 3-haloacetamidobenzoate that was shown in vitro to inhibit tubulin assembly in Leishmania. Here, we tested a topical cream formulated with MF29. BALB/c mice were infected in the ear dermis with L. major metacyclic promastigotes and once the lesion appeared, mice were treated with different concentrations of MF29 and compared to the control group treated with the cream used as the vehicle. We observed that topical application of MF29 reduced the progression of the infection while control groups developed an unhealing lesion that became necrotic. The treatment decreased the type 2 immune response. Comparison with SinaAmphoLeish, another topical treatment, revealed that MF29 treatment once a day was sufficient to control lesion development, while application SinaAmphoLeish needed applications twice daily. Collectively, our data suggest that MF-29 topical application could be a promising topical treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis.",

With our understanding of this diversity has come an appreciation of the longevity and replicative capacity of tissue\u2010resident macrophages and thus the realisation that macrophages may persist through tissue perturbations and inflammatory events with important consequences for cell function. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the parameters that regulate macrophage survival and function, focusing on the relative importance of the tissue environment versus cell\u2010intrinsic factors, such as origin, how long a cell has been resident within a tissue and prior history of activation. Thus, we reconsider the view of macrophages as wholly plastic cells and raise many unanswered questions about the relative importance of cell life\u2010history versus environment in macrophage programming and function.",

        "abstract": "Rationale The role of circulating fetal monocytes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not known. We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia. Methods Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen\u2009\u00d7\u200914 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n\u2009=\u20092 term, n\u2009=\u20093 moderate/late preterm, and n\u2009=\u20095 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n\u2009=\u20094 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay. Results Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 vs. 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vessels per lung field; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14. Conclusions Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.",
