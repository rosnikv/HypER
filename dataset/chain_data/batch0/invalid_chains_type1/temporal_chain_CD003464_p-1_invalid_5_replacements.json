        "abstract": "Background: Patients who suffer a cerebrovascular event are at high risk of a recurrence. Secondary prevention is crucial in reducing the burden of cerebrovascular disease. Objective: To estimate the percentage of stroke survivors receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs and to identify factors associated with such treatment. Design: Cross sectional retrospective cohort study. Methods: Data were analysed from a large collaborative observational study, the Italian \u201csilver network\u201d home care project, which collected data (from 1997 to 2001) on patients admitted to home care programmes (n = 5372). Twenty two home health agencies participated in evaluating the implementation of the minimum dataset for home care (MDS-HC) instrument. For the present study, 648 individuals with a diagnosis of stroke were selected and the initial MDS-HC assessment reported. Results: 70% of stroke survivors did not receive any antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs (95% confidence interval (CI), 66.5 to 73.5). Among all age categories, aspirin and ticlopidine were the two most commonly prescribed drugs. Living alone (odds ratio (OR), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.89)), dependency in activities of daily living (0.66 (0.40 to 0.99)), cognitive impairment (0.58 (0.38 to 0.86)), and low educational level (0.58 (0.34 to 0.98)) were associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving secondary stroke prevention treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease were associated with the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment. Conclusions: Negative attitudes among physicians with respect to secondary stroke prevention are prevalent and reinforce the need for increased awareness of existing data on the risks and benefits for elderly individuals. Social problems and functional impairment may be issues concerning physicians when deciding whether or not the risks of treatment exceed the benefit.",

        "abstract": "Background: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the only treatment that has shown a significant benefit to reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with ischemic stroke and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, OAC is still underused, even at discharge from neurological centers. The objective of this study was to identify the reasons underlying the prescription of OAC at discharge after an ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF. Methods: We investigated the reasons why ischemic stroke patients with NVAF were not treated with OAC at discharge from 40 centers located in 5 European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, and Portugal). Results: Of 320 ischemic stroke survivors at discharge, 186 (58.1%) received OAC, while 260 (81.3%) patients were theoretically eligible according to guidelines and the absence of contraindications. There were significant differences between countries and the logistic regression analysis found being already under OAC before stroke, having no leukoaraiosis, having no potential contraindication, being younger than 75 years, being married and suffering from angina pectoris as independent predictors of being discharged under OAC. Conclusion: This study suggests that besides patient-related factors, the prescription of OAC is also significantly influenced by the social environment and national practices.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014 Stroke is a leading cause of death around the world. Improving the quality of stroke care is a global priority, despite the diverse healthcare economies across nations. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Get With the Guidelines-Stroke program (GWTG-Stroke) has improved the quality of stroke care in 790 US academic and community hospitals, with broad implications for the rest of the country. The generalizability of GWTG-Stroke across national and economic boundaries remains to be tested. The Taiwan Stroke Registry, with 30 599 stroke admissions between 2006 and 2008, was used to assess the applicability of GWTG-Stroke in Taiwan, which spends \u22481/10 of what the United States does in medical costs per new or recurrent stroke. Methods and Results\u2014 Taiwan Stroke Registry, sponsored by the Taiwan Department of Health, engages 39 academic and community hospitals and covers the entire country with 4 steps of quality control to ensure the reliability of entered data. Five GWTG-Stroke performance measures and 1 safety indicator are applicable to assess Taiwan Stroke Registry quality of stroke care. Demographic and outcome figures are comparable between GWTG-Stroke and Taiwan Stroke Registry. Two indicators (early and discharge antithrombotics) are close to GWTG-Stroke standards, while 3 other indicators (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, lipid-lowering medication) and 1 safety indicator fall behind. Preliminary analysis shows that compliance with selected GWTG-Stroke guidelines is associated with better outcomes. Conclusions\u2014 Results suggest that GWTG-Stroke performance measures, with modification for ethnic factors, can become global standards across national and economic boundaries for assessing and improving quality of stroke care and outcomes. GWTG-Stroke can be incorporated into ongoing stroke registries across nations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECT\nOxidative stress may play a role in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but data on oxidative burden in cerebral hemorrhage are limited, and it is not clear whether oxidative markers add predictive power regarding ICH outcome beyond that of traditional factors. The authors therefore examined redox status and traditional factors in ICH patients within 3 days of hemorrhage onset to delineate redox status in ICH and investigate the predictive value with respect to 30-day functional outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-four patients with ICH and 114 controls were prospectively enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected within 3 days of ICH onset and processed for isolation of plasma, erythrocytes, and leukocytes. The authors evaluated levels or activities of leukocyte 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPx), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and vitamin A, as well as traditional factors including the presence of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol level, and measures of liver function. A general linear model and multivariable logistic regression were used for analyses where appropriate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter adjustment for age and sex and traditional risk factors, ICH was significantly associated with an increased level of 8-OHdG (p < 0.0001), decreased GPx activity (p = 0.0002), and a decreased level of vitamin E (p = 0.003). There was no association of ICH risk with G6PD activity or MDA or vitamin A level. Considering all the oxidative markers and traditional risk factors together, logistic regression showed an independent association of ICH with 8-OHdG (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.2, p < 0.0001). The association between increased 8-OHdG level and lower 30-day Barthel Index was also independent of the effects of age, sex, hemorrhage location and size, and traditional factors (p = 0.026). Unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score \u2265 3) at 30 days after ICH onset was not significantly associated with any of the examined oxidative markers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreased leukocyte 8-OHdG levels, as well as decreased GPx activity and vitamin E levels, were found during acute ICH. Only 8-OHdG was associated with ICH and the 30-day outcome independently from the other oxidative markers and traditional factors. Leukocyte 8-OHdG may add power beyond the traditional factors in predicting ICH outcome and thus may be used as an independent surrogate for clinical ICH study.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the rapidly developing clinical signs of focal disturbance of cerebral function of presumed vascular origin; lasting longer than 24 hours can lead to death without another cause, and presents neurological signs and symptoms that occurred so suddenly, with loss of focal or generalized brain function. Among the cerebrovascular diseases, aged 20-59 years old, in Brazil, the CVA corresponds to 80% of hospitalizations due to Unified Health System (SUS). Besides the high incidence, we have to consider the serious medical and social consequences, such as physical sequelae, communication, functional, emotional and other. Such sequelae cause some degree of dependence, especially in the first year, with about 30-40% of patients unable to return to work and requiring devices to performing activities of daily living (ADL). Cases of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, impaired sexual function, motor disturbances, sensory, cognitive and communication are common. 1-4 The motor and sensory recovery occurs between 6 months to 1 year. Regarding the language and cognitive functions, it occurs over long periods of time. Due to the physical and psychosocial sequelae changes are of fundamental importance, participation and family reorganization, providing a better return to the social environment and interaction. Thus, the rehabilitation will start in the hospital setting, should be continued in outpatient care and at the patient's own residence with a focus on family. 5-11 The guidance manuals are tools those assist families and caregivers of patients with special needs, facilitating the continuation of which was addressed by the healthcare professional. The realization of care as the use of cushions, change position every 2 hours, avoid antalgic postures, mobilize the patient properly are essential to prevent complications and accelerate the recovery. When the caregiver has access to an illustrated manual, addressing the disease and care with simplified language, is supposed to care is facilitated. In literature there are publications that address stroke, but for the present study, which was prepared by the author, an illustrated, didactic, and simple and targeted specifically for lay caregivers and family members of patients with manual motor sequelae of stroke. 12-8 \u25cf Evaluating the effectiveness of a guidelines manual for caregivers of patients with stroke. This is a prospective randomized crosssectional study, conducted at a city hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo, from December 2007 to December 2009. The study population consisted of patients with motor sequelae of stroke and their caregivers. Patients with stroke secondary to a recent sequel, exclusively motor (hemiplegia), were included; the patient caregiver accompanies the patient daily in the same home. To conduct this research, it was prepared by the author, a printed manual of physical therapy, illustrated with plain language guidelines and the population studied. The guidelines in this manual are based on the definition of the disease, clinical presentation, appropriate to the hemiplegic patient positioning, exercises, and how to avoid transpostural changes and general complications. Then, 40 caregivers of patients with motor deficit were selected by stroke. The information of escorts was recorded on a record (name, sex, age, and marital status, number of children, relationship, home address, phone, profession, education and usual means of transport). The first stage occurred during the hospital stay and companions were informed about the proposed work. Those who agreed participating signed the consent form. The caregivers were divided by randomization into two groups A and B with 20 caregivers in each group. Then received the first test, called Test A, consisting of a multiple choice questionnaire on the subject addressed. The questions addressed to caregivers were: 1) What is the main feature of the clinical picture of stroke? ; 2) What is the main importance of moving the paralyzed arm carefully; 3) What precautions to avoid skin lesions; 4) What should be done with the patient after stroke, when having difficulty performing assets regardless movements; 5) What to do to prevent swelling of hands and feet; 6) What to do to prevent your toes from getting down with the couple lying belly up patient; 7) Ideal to avoid choking during meals position; 8) As the shoulder should be positioned when the patient lies down facing the affected side; 9) With the patient sitting in a chair, as I support the trunk preventing it OBJECTIVE",

        "title": "Thinking About the Future: A Review of Prognostic Scales Used in Acute Stroke",
        "abstract": "Background: There are many prognostic scales that aim to predict functional outcome following acute stroke. Despite considerable research interest, these scales have had limited impact in routine clinical practice. This may be due to perceived problems with internal validity (quality of research), as well as external validity (generalizability of results). We set out to collate information on exemplar stroke prognosis scales, giving particular attention to the scale content, derivation, and validation. Methods: We performed a focused literature search, designed to return high profile scales that use baseline clinical data to predict mortality or disability. We described prognostic utility and collated information on the content, development and validation of the tools. We critically appraised chosen scales based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS). Results: We chose 10 primary scales that met our inclusion criteria, six of which had revised/modified versions. Most primary scales used 5 input variables (range: 4\u201313), with substantial overlap in the variables included. All scales included age, eight included a measure of stroke severity, while five scales incorporated pre-stroke level of function (often using modified Rankin Scale), comorbidities and classification of stroke type. Through our critical appraisal, we found issues relating to excluding patients with missing data from derivation studies, and basing the selection of model variable on significance in univariable analysis (in both cases noted for six studies). We identified separate external validation studies for all primary scales but one, with a total of 60 validation studies. Conclusions: Most acute stroke prognosis scales use similar variables to predict long-term outcomes and most have reasonable prognostic accuracy. While not all published scales followed best practice in development, most have been subsequently validated. Lack of clinical uptake may relate more to practical application of scales rather than validity. Impact studies are now necessary to investigate clinical usefulness of existing scales.",

        "abstract": "Aim To identify potential predictors of community integration in individuals after stroke using a residential setting-based strategy. Method A prospective cohort of post-stroke individuals was recruited from the Stroke Unit of the Roberto Santos General Hospital (UAVC-HGRS). All included individuals were aged over 18 years, received a diagnosis of ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging and resided in the city of Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). Following discharge from the stroke unit, the individuals themselves, or their responsible parties, were contacted by telephone to schedule a home visit no less than three months after discharge. All subjects were examined in their homes, at which time the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) was also applied. A robust linear regression model was used to assess community reintegration using CIQ score as the outcome variable. Results A total of 124 individuals effectively fulfilled the eligibility criteria: 51.6% were females, the median (IQR) age was 63(53\u201369) years, 82.3% were non-white, 53.2% were married, the median (IQR) of years of schooling was 6 (4\u201312) and family income averaged two minimum monthly wages. Investigated individuals presented a median (IQR) NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 7 (4\u201312). Multivariate linear regression identified the following independent predictors of community integration: age (\u03b2 = -0.095; 95% CI = -0.165 to -0.025; p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (\u03b2 = -2.348; 95% CI = -4.125 to -0.571; p = 0.010), smoking habit (\u03b2 = -2.951; 95% CI = -5.081 to -0.821; p = 0.007), functional capacity upon hospital discharge (\u03b2 = 0.168; 95% CI = 0.093 to 0.242; p = <0.001) and stroke severity (\u03b2 = -0.163; CI = -0.318 to -0.009); p = 0.038). Conclusions Regardless of length of time since stroke, individuals present restrictions that compromise their reintegration into their respective communities. The demographic, clinical and functional factors identified herein as potential predictors should be considered when conducting regular follow-up, as well as in the rehabilitation of individuals after stroke with the purpose to identify the interventions necessary to optimize their reintegration into the community.",

        "abstract": "The importance of assessing the collateral status (CS) in patients with ischaemic stroke (IS) has repeatedly been emphasised in clinical guidelines. Various publications offer qualitative or semiquantitative scales with gradations corresponding to the different extents of the collaterals, visualised mostly on the basis of CTA images. However, information on their inter-rater reliability is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the inter-rater reliability of the scales for collateral assessment. CTA images of 158 patients in the acute period of IS were used in the study. The assessment of CS was performed by two experts using three methodologies: the modified Tan scale, the Miteff scale, and the Rosenthal scale. Cohen\u2019s kappa, weighted kappa and Krippendorff\u2019s alpha were used as reliability measures. For the modified Tan scale and the Miteff and Rosenthal scales, the weighted kappa values were 0.72, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively. Although the best measure of consistency was found for the modified Tan scale, no statistically significant differences were revealed among the scales. The impact of the CS on the degree of neurological deficit at discharge was shown for the modified Tan and Rosenthal scales. In conclusion, the analysis showed a moderate inter-rater reliability of the three scales, but was not able to distinguish the best one among them.",

        "title": "Clinical and Imaging Features Associated With Fast Infarct Growth During Interhospital Transfers of Patients With Large Vessel Occlusions.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nAcute ischemic stroke patients with a large vessel occlusion (LVO) who present to a primary stroke center (PSC) often require transfer to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for thrombectomy. Not much is known about specific characteristics at the PSC that are associated with infarct growth during transfer. Gaining more insight into these features could aid future trials with cytoprotective agents targeted at slowing infarct growth. We aimed to identify baseline clinical and imaging characteristics that are associated with fast infarct growth rate (IGR) during interhospital transfer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included patients from the CT Perfusion to Predict Response to Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke Project, a prospective multicenter study. Patients with an anterior circulation LVO who were transferred from a PSC to a CSC for consideration of thrombectomy were eligible if imaging criteria were fulfilled. A CT perfusion (CTP) needed to be obtained at the PSC followed by an MRI at the CSC, before consideration of thrombectomy. The interhospital IGR was defined as the difference between the infarct volumes on MRI and CTP, divided by the time between the scans. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine characteristics associated with fast IGR (\u22655 mL/h).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 183 patients with a median age of 74 years (interquartile range 61-82), of whom 99 (54%) were male and 82 (45%) were fast progressors, were included. At baseline, fast progressors had a higher NIH Stroke Scale score (median 16 vs 13), lower cerebral blood volume index (median 0.80 vs 0.89), more commonly poor collaterals on CT angiography (35% vs 13%), higher hypoperfusion intensity ratios (HIRs) (median 0.51 vs 0.34), and larger core volumes (median 11.80 mL vs 0.00 mL). In multivariable analysis, higher HIR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for every 0.10 increase 1.32 [95% CI 1.10-1.59]) and larger core volume (aOR for every 10 mL increase 1.54 [95% CI 1.20-2.11]) remained independently associated with fast IGR.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nFast infarct growth during interhospital transfer of acute stroke patients is associated with imaging markers of poor collaterals on baseline imaging. These markers are promising targets for patient selection in cytoprotective trials aimed at reducing interhospital infarct growth.",
