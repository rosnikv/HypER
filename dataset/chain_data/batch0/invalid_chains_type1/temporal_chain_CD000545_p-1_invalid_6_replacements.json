Non-crossover data likewise confirmed the superiority of 6-MP. The drug was more effective than placebo in closing fistulas (31 vs 6%) and in permitting discontinuation or reduction of steroid dosage (75 vs. 36%) (P less than 0.001). The onset of response to 6-MP was often delayed, with 32% of patients taking longer than three months to respond, and 19% taking longer than four months. Adverse side effects to 6-MP occurred in 10% of patients and were uniformly reversible. We conclude that 6-MP is an effective and useful agent in the management of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Fifty\u2010two patients with Crohn's disease have been assessed using acute phase proteins and a scoring system. Thirty\u2010nine underwent operation and intra\u2010abdominal abscesses were found in seventeen. Both scores and acute phase proteins have been shown to reflect inflammation due to secondary sepsis in addition to that from active Crohn's disease. The scores were higher, and acute phase changes greater, in patients with sepsis than those without. By choosing a threshold for each variable that excludes patients without sepsis it has been found that a score > 181, ESR >45 mm/h, CRP >33 mg/l, orosomucoid >1.8g/l and albumin < 26.7 g/l identify sepsis with a specificity >95 per cent and sensitivity > 35 per cent. Over 70 per cent of patients with abscesses exceeded one or more of these thresholds. We believe that operative management should be strongly considered if one or more of these criteria are positive as such patients have a greater than 90 per cent chance of having an intra\u2010abdominal abscess. This will prevent these abscesses eroding into adjacent viscera or to the surface with resulting fistula formation.",

The serum concentrations of serum amyloid A protein (SAA), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1\u2010antichymotrypsin (alpha 1\u2010ACT) and alpha 1\u2010acid glycoprotein (alpha 1\u2010AGP) have been measured in eighty\u2010six patients with Crohn's disease, twenty\u2010five patients with ulcerative colitis and twenty\u2010two patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. In the Crohn's and ulcerative colitis group significant increases in concentration were observed in all four proteins, which parallelled disease severity as defined by other conventional laboratory parameters formulated into a simple activity index. In the irritable bowel group no significant changes were seen. Serum amyloid A and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease when mild, but did not differ significantly when severe. Serum amyloid A correlated well with CRP (r= 0\u00b783) and alpha 1\u2010ACT (r= 0\u00b780), but less well with alpha 1\u2010AGP (r= 0\u00b765). Serum amyloid A was the most sensitive protein (77%) but had the lowest specificity (74%). C\u2010reactive protein was less sensitive (58%) than SAA but had greater specificity (100%). Alpha 1\u2010ACT had a sensitivity and specificity similar to CRP and, therefore, provided little or no additional information. Alpha 1\u2010AGP, although also 100% specific, had the lowest sensitivity (34%) and, therefore, is probably the least useful acute phase monitor of inflammatory bowel disease.

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 of these patients to generate soluble interleukin-2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations of patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 19) were significantly elevated (757 +/- 438 U/ml) compared with levels in patients with inactive disease (n = 10; 412 +/- 120 U/ml) and healthy control individuals (n = 40; 375 +/- 102 U/ml; p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). Serial determinations of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration in a follow-up of 11 hospitalized patients treated for highly active disease showed a decrease from 1252 +/- 494 U/ml to 527 +/- 193 U/ml (p less than 0.004) that corresponded to clinical improvement, as assessed by Crohn's disease activity index and a reduction of inflammatory parameters. In vitro phytohemagglutinin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn's disease resulted in elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor production not only in patients with active disease (3987 +/- 2439 U/ml), but also in patients with inactive disease (3297 +/- 2282 U/ml), compared with the amount of soluble interleukin-2 receptor produced by mononuclear cells of healthy individuals (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, cultivation of mononuclear cells without mitogen resulted in higher soluble interleukin-2 receptor production in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.02). However, patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis also had significantly increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (1080 +/- 400 U/ml) compared with the levels in patients with chronic disease (455 +/- 140 U/ml; p less than 0.0025). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with ulcerative colitis produced significantly more soluble interleukin-2 receptor upon mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (2314 +/- 936 U/ml), than cells from healthy controls (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.05). The finding of elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels in patients with active Crohn's disease and its increased production by mononuclear cells of patients with both active and inactive disease is a further example of an alteration of the immune system in this condition; however, this alteration can also be found in other inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "title": "The urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori.",
        "abstract": "The urea breath test (UBT) is the most important noninvasive test for Helicobacter pyloni. It is easy to perform, reliable, comparatively cheap, and without risk to patients. Its main indication is in follow up after attempted H pyloni eradication and hence it has important advantages over the other main non-invasive test, serology. The UBT is already widely used as a research tool and deserves wider use in routine clinical practice. Helicobacter pylori produces large amounts of a powerful urease enzyme the detection of which forms the basis of the UBT. Gastric urease was first reported in 1923 by Luck who described hydrolysis ofurea in the stomachs ofdogs and other animals' and it was not long before humans were added to the list.2 In the 1950s Kornberg used a forerunner of the UBT in anaesthetised cats to show that antibiotics destroyed urease activity and thus concluded that urease was bacterial in origin.3 The discovery ofH pyloii by Warren and Marshall in 19834 was not at first linked to gastric urease (the bacterium was thought to be urease negative!5) but the relation soon became obvious.6 The benefit of urease to H pylori is still much debated but its usefulness in diagnosis was quickly recognised and in 1985 the biopsy urease test was first described in a modified form by McNaulty.' In 1987 Graham described the first UBT specifically designed to detect H pyloni using urea labelled with the stable isotope '3C,8 and his description was quickly followed by reports of UBTs using the radioactive isotope '4C from the UK,9 Australia,'\" and The Netherlands.\" The principle of the UBT is simple. Urea isotopically labelled with 13C or '4C is given orally and ifH pyloii is present in the stomach its urease enzyme hydrolyses the urea producing isotopically labelled carbon dioxide. This diffuses into blood, is excreted by the lungs, and can be detected in breath. Many refinements to this essentially simple test have been described, the importance of which depends upon the information required from the test and the situations in which it is to be used. In the primary diagnosis of gastroduodenal pathology, endoscopy based tests are indicated rather than UBTs. Endoscopy gives much more information than just whether Hpylori is present in the stomach and this helps when making treatment decisions, including whether or not to treat the infection. In situations, however, where knowledge of H pylori status alone is needed UBTs have obvious advantages; they are without risk, well tolerated, comparatively cheap, and do not require experienced operators. Thus the main indication for UBT is after attempted H pylori eradication in those situations where follow up endoscopy is unnecessary. Checking eradication is important as treatment failure is comparatively common and the success or failure of treatment has important implications for further treatment and follow up and for patient advice or reassurance. Follow up after treatment is not, however, the only indication for breath testing. Others include checking for infection when an ulcer is found on barium meal and checking for infection when an ulcer is found at endoscopy but biopsy specimens cannot be taken because of anticoagulant treatment. The information needed from a UBT is whether or not H pyloni infection is present. In some research situations it may be desirable to quantify urease activity but in clinical situations this is not necessary and UBT protocols should be kept simple and not made more complicated to try to obtain this information. The aim should be to discriminate accurately between H pylori positive and negative patients while minimising inconvenience and cost. What are the causes of inaccuracies in the test? The commonest reason for false negative tests is breath testing too soon after a course of antibiotics,'0 bismuth89 or omeprazole\" whether given specifically as a treatment forH pylori or not. Breath testing should not be performed until at least one month after the end of such a course of treatment. ' \" False negative tests can also occur after gastric surgery, presumably because of rapid emptying of urea from the stomach, and false positive tests are possible if other urease producing bacteria are present in the stomach such as may occur in patients with achlorhydria from gastric atrophy.'4 Breath testing should be used with caution in these situations. Suboptimal UBT protocols are another potential cause of inaccurate results. In practice, however, most published protocols give similar accuracy with sensitivity ranging from 90-100% and specificity from 78100%\" 1524 when compared with biopsy based tests. The low specificity for UBT in some of these trials is misleading and merely reflects the low sensitivity of tests with which UBT is compared. As most UBT protocols give acceptable accuracy the decision about which to use must depend largely on other factors such as safety, cost, convenience to the patient and operator, and speed at which results can be available. These factors in turn depend mainly on whether the '3C or '4C UBT is used, as both have practical problems and advantages arising to a large extent from the theoretical problems and advantages of '3C and 'C as isotopic markers. The main theoretical problem for the '3C UBT is that '3C occurs naturally and at somewhat variable concentrations, usually being present in about 1-11% of expired carbon dioxide. In a positive breath test this may, for example, increase by just 0 01% to reach 1-12% a tiny increase on a 723",

All studies to date have examined mucosal T cells, although much of the tissue damage occurs in the submucosa and muscle layers. The aim of this work was to study T cell proliferation throughout the intestinal wall in children with IBD. Surgical resection material from 19 children with CD (10 ileal, 10 colonic), seven with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 12 normal controls was studied. The distribution of dividing T cells was investigated by double\u2010immunohistochemistry using Ki67 to identify proliferating cells, and CD3 to identify T cells. In ileal and colonic lamina propria virtually no Ki67+, CD3+ cells were seen in control, UC or CD tissue. In contrast, there were significantly more Ki67+, CD3+ cells within the lymphoid follicles of ileal and colonic CD than in the follicles in UC and controls. Increased numbers of Ki67+, CD3+ cells were present in the submucosa, muscle layers (M) and serosa in Crohn's ileitis and colitis compared with the lamina propria (LP), although only in the muscle of the colon was the difference statistically significant (LP, 0.4% (0\u20131%); M, 1.6% (0\u20135.2%); P\u2003=\u20030.03). Pooling data from ileal and colonic CD, however, did show significantly increased Ki67+, CD3+ cells in both serosa and muscle layers compared with the LP. Dividing T cells have been identified in the deeper layers of the gut wall in CD. These may contribute to the fibrosis and muscle hyperplasia characteristic of the condition.",

        "abstract": "Summary: Experimental data indicate that mucosal CD4+ T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Based on the pattern of cytokine production, CD4+ T cells may be distinguished into two different phenotypes. Th1 responses are characterized by secretion of interleukin (IL)\u20102, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr;, lymphotoxin, and interferon (IFN)\u2010&ggr; and are associated with delayedtype hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Th2 responses, which are characterized by secretion of IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010, have been associated with humoral immune responses and allergy. To assess the number of IFN\u2010&agr; and IL\u20104 positive cells in IBD and normal intestinal specimens, frozen sections from intestinal specimens from 10 Crohn's disease (CD), 8 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 healthy controls were examined by immunohistochemistry.

T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration and cytokine expression by epithelial, lamina propria, and submucosal cells were scored on a four\u2010point scale by two independent observers who were blinded for the clinical data. One\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was used for statistical analysis. In intestinal specimens from IBD patients, the number of CD3+ cells was found increased in the lamina propria and, within the submucosa, this increase was significant (p < 0.001). In CD the number of lamina propria IFN\u2010&ggr; positive cells was significantly increased as compared with controls (p < 0.002).

CXCL10 was constitutively expressed by basal crypts in mouse colon, but the expression of CXCL10 as well as CXCR3 was enhanced in the epithelium in the proliferative zone after oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium. Neutralization of CXCL10 protected mice from epithelial ulceration by promoting crypt cell survival without evidence of altered immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, recombinant CXCL10 administration into mice inhibited intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. These findings suggest that CXCL10 regulates crypt cell growth to maintain intestinal homeostasis in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.

Whereas DCs have been proven to undergo afferent lymphatic pathway to enter LNs from peripheral tissues, a question remains if DCs also migrate into LNs directly from the circulation.

Bacterial infection induces a significant number of pDC and myeloid DC (mDC) precursors into the circulation. Both subsets express a common set of chemokine receptors except CXCR3, display parallel mobilization into the blood, but show distinct trafficking pathway to the LNs. In a short-term homing assay, whereas mDC precursors migrate to peripheral tissues and subsequently to draining LNs, pDC precursors directly enter the LNs in a CXCL9 and E-selectin dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha controls not only DC precursor mobilization into the blood but also chemokine up-regulation on LN HEVs. A similar trafficking pathway is observed also in viral infection, and CXCR3(-/-) mice-derived pDC precursors show defective trans-HEV migration.

DCs serve as critical links between the innate and adaptive immune responses against many pathogens, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The role of DCs as mediators of resistance to HSV-1 infection was investigated using CD11c-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, in which DCs can be transiently depleted in vivo by treatment with low doses of DT. We show that ablation of DCs led to enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the highly resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. Specifically, we showed that the depletion of DCs led to increased viral spread into the nervous system, resulting in an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we showed that ablation of DCs impaired the optimal activation of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to HSV-1. These data demonstrated that DCs were essential not only in the optimal activation of the acquired T-cell response to HSV-1 but also that DCs were crucial for innate resistance to HSV-1 infection.",

        "abstract": "The chemokine, CXCL10, chemotactic for NK cells, activated T cells, and dendritic cells is highly expressed during viral infections, including HSV-1. The importance of this chemokine to the control of HSV-1 infection was tested using mice deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10\u2212/\u2212). Following corneal infection, HSV-1 viral titers were elevated in the nervous system of CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment including dendritic cells, NK cells, and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain stem. In the absence of NK cells and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in wild-type (WT) or CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, similar levels of virus were recovered in the nervous system, suggesting these cells are responsible for the observed defects in the control of viral replication in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Leukocyte mobilization was also compared between WT, CXCL10\u2212/\u2212, and mice deficient in the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212). NK cell mobilization was comparably reduced in both CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 and CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to WT animals. However, the reduction in mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 was not observed in CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice following HSV-1 infection. The defect was not the result of an alternative receptor for CXCL10, as Ag-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment was not reduced in mice which were deficient in both CXCL10 and CXCR3. Thus, CXCL10 deficiency results in reduced mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells as a result of dysregulation of CXCR3 signaling.",

        "abstract": "The genome of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes 86 proteins, but only a limited set is expressed in EBV\u2013growth transformed B cells, termed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). These cells proliferate via the concerted action of EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and latent membrane proteins (LMPs), some of which are rate limiting to establish a stable homeostasis of growth promoting and anti-apoptotic activities. We show here that EBV mutants, which lack the EBNA-3A gene, are impaired but can still initiate cell cycle entry and proliferation of primary human B cells in contrast to an EBNA-2 deficient mutant virus. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous reports, these viral mutants are attenuated in growth transformation assays but give rise to permanently growing EBNA-3A negative B cell lines which exhibit reduced proliferation rates and elevated levels of apoptosis. Expression profiles of EBNA-3A deficient LCLs are characterized by 129 down-regulated and 167 up-regulated genes, which are significantly enriched for genes involved in apoptotic processes or cell cycle progression like the tumor suppressor gene p16/INK4A, or might contribute to essential steps of the viral life cycle in the infected host. In addition, EBNA-3A cellular target genes remarkably overlap with previously identified targets of EBNA-2. This study comprises the first genome wide expression profiles of EBNA-3A target genes generated within the complex network of viral proteins of the growth transformed B cell and permits a more detailed understanding of EBNA-3A's function and contribution to viral pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The human polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) establishes a latent and asymptomatic infection in the majority of the population. In immunocompromised individuals, the virus frequently (re)activates and may cause severe disease such as interstitial nephritis and hemorrhagic cystitis. Currently, the therapeutic options are limited to reconstitution of the antiviral immune response. T cells are particularly important for controlling this virus, and T cell therapies may provide a highly specific and effective mode of treatment. However, little is known about the phenotype and function of BKV-specific T cells in healthy individuals. Using tetrameric BKV peptide-HLA-A02 complexes, we determined the presence, phenotype, and functional characteristics of circulating BKV VP1-specific CD8+ T cells in 5 healthy individuals. We show that these cells are present in low frequencies in the circulation and that they have a resting CD45RA\u2212 CD27+ memory and predominantly CCR7\u2212 CD127+ KLRG1+ CD49dhi CXCR3hi T-betint Eomesoderminlo phenotype. Furthermore, their direct cytotoxic capacity seems to be limited, since they do not readily express granzyme B and express only little granzyme K. We compared these cells to circulating CD8+ T cells specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and influenza virus (Flu) in the same donors and show that BKV-specific T cells have a phenotype that is distinct from that of CMV- and EBV-specific T cells. Lastly, we show that BKV-specific T cells are polyfunctional since they are able to rapidly express interleukin-2 (IL-2), gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and also, to a much lower extent, MIP-1\u03b2 and CD107a.",

        "abstract": "A broad spectrum of diseases is characterized by myelin abnormalities and/or oligodendrocyte pathology. In most, if not all, of these diseases, early activation of microglia occurs. Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering early microglia activation is, however, incomplete. In this study, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the temporal and causal relationship of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and early microglia activation. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed the induction of distinct chemokines, among them Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Early microglia activation was unchanged in CCL2- and CCL3-deficient knockouts, but was significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice, resulting in an amelioration of cuprizone toxicity at later time points. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that recombinant CXCL10 induced migration and a proinflammatory phenotype in cultured microglia, without affecting their phagocytic activity or proliferation. In situ hybridization analyses suggest that Cxcl10 mRNA is mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also oligodendrocytes, in short-term cuprizone-exposed mice. Our results show that CXCL10 actively participates in the initiation of microglial activation. These findings have implications for the role of CXCL10 as an important mediator during the initiation of neuroinflammatory processes associated with oligodendrocyte pathology.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress critically contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Astrocytes are the main regulators of oxidative homeostasis in the brain and dysregulation of these cells likely contributes to the accumulation of oxidative damage. The nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2010related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the main transcriptional regulator of the anti\u2010oxidant stress defense. In this study, we elucidate the effects of astrocytic Nrf2\u2010activation on brain\u2010intrinsic inflammation and lesion development. Cells deficient for the Nrf2 repressor kelch\u2010like ECH\u2010associated protein 1 (Keap1) are characterized by hyperactivation of Nrf2\u2010signaling. Therefore, wild type mice and mice with a GFAP\u2010specific Keap1\u2010deletion were fed with 0.25% cuprizone for 1 or 3 weeks. Cuprizone intoxication induced pronounced oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination and reactive gliosis in wild type animals. In contrast, astrocyte\u2010specific Nrf2\u2010activation was sufficient to prevent oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination, to ameliorate brain intrinsic inflammation and to counteract axonal damage. Our results highlight the potential of the Nrf2/ARE system for the treatment of neuroinflammation in general and of multiple sclerosis in particular. \u00a9 GLIA 2016;64:2219\u20132230",

        "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are integral to efficient neuronal signaling. Loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes is a central feature of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The results of neuropathological studies suggest that oligodendrocytes react with differing sensitivity to toxic insults, with some cells dying early during lesion development and some cells being resistant for weeks. This proposed graded vulnerability has never been demonstrated but provides an attractive window for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the biochemical pathways associated with graded oligodendrocyte vulnerability have not been well explored. We used immunohistochemistry and serial block\u2010face scanning electron microscopy (3D\u2010SEM) to show that cuprizone\u2010induced metabolic stress results in an \u201cout of phase\u201d degeneration of oligodendrocytes. Although expression induction of stress response transcription factors in oligodendrocytes occurs within days, subsequent oligodendrocyte apoptosis continues for weeks. In line with the idea of an out of phase degeneration of oligodendrocytes, detailed ultrastructural reconstructions of the axon\u2013myelin unit demonstrate demyelination of single internodes. In parallel, genome wide array analyses revealed an active unfolded protein response early after initiation of the cuprizone intoxication. In addition to the cytoprotective pathways, the pro\u2010apoptotic transcription factor DNA damage\u2010inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) was induced early in oligodendrocytes. In advanced lesions, DDIT3 was as well expressed by activated astrocytes. Toxin\u2010induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, microgliosis, astrocytosis, and acute axonal damage were less intense in the Ddit3\u2010null mutants. This study identifies DDIT3 as an important regulator of graded oligodendrocyte vulnerability in a MS animal model. Interference with this stress cascade might offer a promising therapeutic approach for demyelinating disorders.",

        "abstract": "The water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is required for a normal rate of water exchange across the blood\u2013brain interface. Following the discovery that AQP4 is a possible autoantigen in neuromyelitis optica, the function of AQP4 in health and disease has become a research focus. While several studies have addressed the expression and function of AQP4 during inflammatory demyelination, relatively little is known about its expression during non-autoimmune-mediated myelin damage. In this study, we used the toxin-induced demyelination model cuprizone as well as a combination of metabolic and autoimmune myelin injury (i.e., Cup/EAE) to investigate AQP4 pathology. We show that during toxin-induced demyelination, diffuse AQP4 expression increases, while polarized AQP4 expression at the astrocyte endfeet decreases. The diffuse increased expression of AQP4 was verified in chronic-active multiple sclerosis lesions. Around inflammatory brain lesions, AQP4 expression dramatically decreased, especially at sites where peripheral immune cells penetrate the brain parenchyma. Humoral immune responses appear not to be involved in this process since no anti-AQP4 antibodies were detected in the serum of the experimental mice. We provide strong evidence that the diffuse increase in anti-AQP4 staining intensity is due to a metabolic injury to the brain, whereas the focal, perivascular loss of anti-AQP4 immunoreactivity is mediated by peripheral immune cells.",
