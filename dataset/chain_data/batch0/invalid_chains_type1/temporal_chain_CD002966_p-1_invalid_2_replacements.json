        "abstract": "In order to compare the effects of metformin and gliclazide on fasting serum insulin, 60 non-insulin dependent diabetics were included in a multi-centre study. Patients on a diabetic diet alone or a diabetic diet together with a sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agent, with a fasting glucose greater than 1.4 g/l, on two measurements were included in the study. They were randomly allocated to two parallel groups and received either gliclazide or metformin. They were treated for three months and attended for consultation at one month and three months. The fasting serum insulin level decreased significantly in the group receiving metformin (26.2 +/- 3.2 mlU/L at entry versus 19.8 +/- 2.3 mlU/L after three months: less than 0.01), and increased in a non-significant way in the group receiving gliclazide (21.6 +/- 3 mlU/L versus 26.5 +/- 5 mlU/L after three months: NS). The difference between the two groups was significant (p less than 0.01). There was a comparable significant improvement in blood sugar levels during the three months in both patients receiving gliclazide and metformin. However, significant weight loss (p less than 0.05) occurred only in patients receiving metformin. There was an identical improvement in blood sugar control in both patients receiving gliclazide and metformin over the three months. On the other hand, fasting serum insulin levels decreased significantly in patients receiving metformin compared to gliclazide. The effect of metformin on serum insulin levels is probably due to its action on insulin resistance and its lack of effect on insulin secretion, in contrast to sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents like gliclazide.",

Results relative to loss of weight in these three groups were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor a 12-month period, no significant weight loss was noted in group 1, and group 2 showed a small nonsignificant weight loss in 6 months. Only group 3 had a significant weight loss at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, maximizing at a mean weight loss of 22 lb (10 kg) at 12 months. In addition, in those patients in whom data were available, a significant weight loss was found at 18 and 21 months. At 21 months, however, weight began to increase. Percentage weight loss followed a pattern similar to that seen with total weight loss. The proportion of patients losing weight did not differ significantly in groups 1 and 2; however, in group 3, after 3 and 12 months a significant proportion of patients (79% and 86%, respectively) had lost weight. Race, gender, or baseline body weight had no effect on weight loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrom this retrospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes, we conclude that conversion from insulin to combination oral therapy with sulfonylureas and metformin results in a significant weight loss for up to 21 months.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has assumed epidemic dimensions. Children are now vulnerable to a disease that was once the exclusive domain of adulthood. Increased body weight and sedentary behavior accelerate insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, leading to the clinical manifestation of hyperglycemia. Other cardiovascular risk factors tend to cluster in this milieu, setting the stage for vastly increased macrovascular morbidity. Many more people have impaired glucose tolerance (\u2018prediabetes\u2019). They are not only at risk for frank diabetes but also for the recently recognized entity of \u2018metabolic syndrome,\u2019 which is further characterized by hypertension, dyslipidemia, and central adiposity. A multifactorial approach addressing these aspects in addition to intensive glycemic control is the most efficacious therapy, optimally achieved through a team effort comprising the clinician, diabetes nurse, dietitian, and other professionals. Early use of oral-agent combinations is gaining favor. Insulin is best utilized in a basal-bolus fashion to manage both fasting and postprandial glycemia, delivered with multiple-dose injections or continuously via the pump. In hospitalized patients, good diabetic control reduces mortality. Finally, recent trials show that optimal weight maintenance and regular exercise can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Such information can serve as the foundation for large-scale preventive endeavors at the community level.",

We show that a murine model of diabetes is associated with the development of ER stress in beta cells and that treatment with the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 significantly reduced biochemical markers of islet ER stress in vivo. Exendin-4 attenuated translational downregulation of insulin and improved cell survival in purified rat beta cells and in INS-1 cells following induction of ER stress in vitro. GLP-1R agonists significantly potentiated the induction of ATF-4 by ER stress and accelerated recovery from ER stress-mediated translational repression in INS-1 beta cells in a PKA-dependent manner. The effects of exendin-4 on the induction of ATF-4 were mediated via enhancement of ER stress-stimulated ATF-4 translation. Moreover, exendin-4 reduced ER stress-associated beta cell death in a PKA-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that GLP-1R signaling directly modulates the ER stress response leading to promotion of beta cell adaptation and survival.",

Chronic and s.c. administration of exendin-4 reduced hyperglycemia. The treatment caused significant increases of the insulin contents of the pancreas and islets, and retained the insulin-positive area.

        "abstract": "Exendin-4, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1-receptor agonist, is known to enhance beta-cell function, but the active mechanism by which it modulates beta-cell mass still remains unclear. We investigated what the long-term effects of exendin-4 (300 pmol/kg body weight per day) on beta-cell function and mass would be in 90% pancreatectomized (Px) Sprague Dawley rats; half of whom were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 20 mg/kg body weight) and half of whom were not. Exendin-4 improved glucose tolerance by elevating serum insulin levels in both STZ-treated and untreated Px rats. At hyperglycemic clamp, STZ attenuated both first and second phase insulin secretion in STZ- and saline-treated Px rats, but exendin-4 incompletely reversed the attenuation. Since STZ mostly removed the remaining beta-cells by increasing apoptosis after Px, their regeneration was initiated through neogenesis, which was determined by the number of beta-cells budding from pancreatic duct layers and small clusters. Exendin-4 enhanced beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis in STZ-treated and -untreated Px rats and reduced beta-cell apoptosis partly by attenuating the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-response genes such as X-box-binding protein-1, activating transcription factor (ATF)-4, ATF6, and C/EBP-homologous protein. In conclusion, exendin-4 improved glycemic control by potentiating beta-cell function and increasing beta-cell mass by increasing beta-cell neogenesis and proliferation and by decreasing apoptosis in diabetic rats.",

        "abstract": "There is a progressive deterioration in \u03b2-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. At diagnosis, islet function may be reduced by up to 50% compared with healthy control subjects, and there is also likely to be a reduction in \u03b2-cell mass of up to 60%. The reduction in \u03b2-cell mass is due to accelerated apoptosis. Currently, few pharmacological therapies address this reduction in \u03b2-cell mass and function. This means that patients are generally subjected to an increasing polypharmacy to control their diabetes, with most eventually being treated by insulin. Incretin hormones, which are released from the gastrointestinal tract after a meal, enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreas, aiding the overall regulation of glucose homeostasis in healthy subjects. In addition, these hormones, especially glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, have a number of protective effects on the \u03b2-cells, including a reduction in apoptosis and enhancement of \u03b2-cell proliferation and neogenesis. These benefits are lost to a significant extent in patients with diabetes. The recently developed diabetes therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exenatide and liraglutide, appear to have beneficial effects on \u03b2-cell function and hence offer promise for durable glycemic control as well as potentially reducing the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe clinical course of type 2 diabetes is characterized by a progressive decline in \u03b2-cell mass and function. Although the elevated levels of fasting glucose and impairment of insulin action in peripheral tissues may predate the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia only results after a prolonged period of \u03b2-cell degeneration, a process that may begin as much as 12 years before diagnosis, involving a progressive reduction in functionality and mass (1,2).

        "abstract": "Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is currently the most effective treatment of obesity, although limited by availability and operative risk. The gut hormones Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Peptide YY (PYY), and Oxyntomodulin (OXM) are elevated postprandially after RYGB, which has been postulated to contribute to its metabolic benefits. Objective: We hypothesized that infusion of the three gut hormones to achieve levels similar to those encountered postprandially in RYGB patients might be effective in suppressing appetite. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a continuous infusion of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY (GOP) on energy intake and expenditure in obese volunteers. Methods: Obese volunteers were randomized to receive an infusion of GOP or placebo in a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study for 10.5 hours a day. This was delivered subcutaneously using a pump device, allowing volunteers to remain ambulatory. Ad libitum food intake studies were performed during the infusion, and energy expenditure was measured using a ventilated hood calorimeter. Results: Postprandial levels of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY seen post RYGB were successfully matched using 4 pmol/kg/min, 4 pmol/kg/min, and 0.4 pmol/kg/min, respectively. This dose led to a mean reduction of 32% in food intake. No significant effects on resting energy expenditure were observed. Conclusion: This is, to our knowledge, the first time that an acute continuous subcutaneous infusion of GOP, replicating the postprandial levels observed after RYGB, is shown to be safe and effective in reducing food intake. This data suggests that triple hormone therapy might be a useful tool against obesity.",

Therefore, the development of pharmacotherapies to address the pathology underlying the dysregulation of energy homeostasis is critical. Areas covered: This review examines selected clinical trial evidence for the pharmacologic treatment of obesity and provides an expert opinion on anti-obesity drug development. The article includes the outcomes of anti-obesity medications that have been evaluated in clinical trials but have not yet received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The mechanisms of action of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and co-agonists, diabetes medications being investigated for weight loss, and medications acting on the central nervous system as well as peripherally are reviewed. A search was conducted on PubMed using the terms \u2018Obesity AND Medications\u2019 restricted to clinical trials reported in English. Using similar terms, a search was also conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov. Expert opinion: The goal of anti-obesity therapy is finding compounds that are effective and have minimal side effects. Combining medications targeting more than one of the redundant mechanisms driving obesity increases efficacy. However, targeting peripheral mechanisms to overcome the trickle-down effects of centrally acting drugs may be the key to success in treating obesity.",

The crucial improvement in pancreatic islet function observed after surgery is induced by alteration in several factors, including gut hormones. In addition to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), increasing lines of evidence show that peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) plays a key role in the metabolic benefits associated with the surgery, ranging from appetite regulation to amelioration of islet secretory properties and survival. Here, we summarize the current knowledge and the latest advancements in the field, which pitch a strong case for the development of novel PYY-based therapy for the treatment of diabetes.",

        "title": "Positive Effects of NPY1 Receptor Activation on Islet Structure Are Driven by Pancreatic Alpha- and Beta-Cell Transdifferentiation in Diabetic Mice",
        "abstract": "Enzymatically stable and specific neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPYR1) agonists, such as sea lamprey PYY(1-36) (SL-PYY(1-36)), are believed to improve glucose regulation in diabetes by targeting pancreatic islets. In this study, streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic transgenic GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP and Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mouse models have been used to study effects of sustained NPYR1 activation on islet cell composition and alpha- and beta-cell lineage transitioning. STZ induced a particularly severe form of diabetes in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, but twice-daily administration (25 nmol/kg) of SL-PYY(1-36) for 11 days consistently improved metabolic status. Blood glucose was decreased (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001) and both fasted plasma and pancreatic insulin significantly increased by SL-PYY(1-36). In both GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP and Ins1 Cre/+; Rosa26-eYFP mice, STZ provoked characteristic losses (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001) of islet numbers, beta-cell and pancreatic islet areas together with increases in area and central islet location of alpha-cells. With exception of alpha-cell area, these morphological changes were fully, or partially, returned to non-diabetic control levels by SL-PYY(1-36). Interestingly, STZ apparently triggered decreased (p < 0.001) alpha- to beta-cell transition in GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP mice, together with increased loss of beta-cell identity in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, but both effects were significantly (p < 0.001) reversed by SL-PYY(1-36). SL-PYY(1-36) also apparently reduced (p < 0.05) beta- to alpha-cell conversion in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice and glucagon expressing alpha-cells in GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP mice. These data indicate that islet benefits of prolonged NPY1R activation, and especially restoration of beta-cell mass, are observed irrespective of diabetes status, being linked to cell lineage alterations including transdifferentiation of alpha- to beta-cells.",

        "title": "Novel enzyme\u2010resistant pancreatic polypeptide analogs evoke pancreatic beta\u2010cell rest, enhance islet cell turnover, and inhibit food intake in mice",
        "abstract": "Abstract Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a postprandial hormone secreted from pancreatic islets that activates neuropeptide Y4 receptors (NPY4Rs). PP is known to induce satiety but effects at the level of the endocrine pancreas are less well characterized. In addition, rapid metabolism of PP by dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP\u20104) limits the investigation of the effects of the native peptide. Therefore, in the present study, five novel amino acid substituted and/or fatty acid derivatized PP analogs were synthesized, namely [P3]PP, [K13Pal]PP, [P3,K13Pal]PP, [N\u2010Pal]PP, and [N\u2010Pal,P3]PP, and their impact on pancreatic beta\u2010cell function, as well as appetite regulation and glucose homeostasis investigated. All PP analogs displayed increased resistance to DPP\u20104 degradation. In addition, all peptides inhibited alanine\u2010induced insulin secretion from BRIN\u2010BD11 beta cells. Native PP and related analogs (10\u22128 and 10\u22126\u2009M), and especially [P3]PP and [K13Pal]PP, significantly protected against cytokine\u2010induced beta\u2010cell apoptosis and promoted cellular proliferation, with effects dependent on the NPY4R for all peptides barring [N\u2010Pal,P3]PP. In mice, all peptides, except [N\u2010Pal]PP and [N\u2010Pal,P3]PP, evoked a dose\u2010dependent (25, 75, and 200\u2009nmol/kg) suppression of appetite, with native PP and [P3]PP further augmenting glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 (GLP\u20101) and cholecystokinin (CCK) induced reductions of food intake. The PP peptides had no obvious detrimental effect on glucose tolerance and they did not noticeably impair the glucose\u2010regulatory actions of GLP\u20101 or CCK. In conclusion, Pro3 amino acid substitution of PP, either alone or together with mid\u2010chain acylation, creates PP analogs with benefits on beta\u2010cell rest, islet cell turnover, and energy regulation that may be applicable to the treatment of diabetes and obesity.",
