        "title": "Combinations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium supplements in hypertension.",
        "abstract": "Dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium have each been reported to lower blood pressure, but the extent of blood pressure reduction in epidemiological studies and clinical trials has tended to be small and inconsistent. We hypothesized that combinations of these mineral supplements would lower blood pressure and that the reductions would be greater than that usually reported in studies of each cation alone. One hundred twenty-five patients 82 men and 43 women) with untreated mild or borderline hypertension were randomly assigned to daily treatment with one of the following four regimens: 60 mmol potassium and 25 mmol (1000 mg) calcium, 60 mmol potassium and 15 mmol (360 mg) magnesium, calcium and magnesium, or placebo. Standardized clinic blood pressure measurements were obtained on 3 days at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. At baseline, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- SD) were 139 +/- 12 and 90 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, and dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were 77 +/- 32, 19 +/- 13, and 12 +/- 52 mmol/d, respectively. The mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) of the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures between the treatment and placebo groups were not significant: -0.7 (-4.3 to +2.9) and -0.4 (-2.9 to +2.1) for potassium and calcium, -1.3 (-4.4 to +1.8) and 0.4 (-2.5 to +3.3) for potassium and magnesium, and +2.1 (-1.8 to +6.0) and +2.2 (-1.0 to +5.4) for calcium and magnesium. In conclusion, this trial provides little evidence of an important role of combinations of cation supplements in the treatment of mild or borderline hypertension.",

        "title": "Renal inflammation is modulated by potassium in chronic kidney disease: possible role of Smad7.",
        "abstract": "High-potassium diets have been shown to be beneficial in cardiovascular disease partly because of a blood pressure-lowering effect. The effect of potassium on inflammation has not been studied. We investigated the influence of potassium supplementation on the degree of renal inflammation and the intracellular signaling mechanisms that could mediate inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD was created in male Sprague-Dawley rats by subtotal nephrectomy. Two groups of CKD rats were pair fed with diets containing 2.1% potassium (potassium-supplemented diet) or 0.4% potassium (basal diet). Body weight, blood pressure, and blood and urine electrolytes were measured biweekly. The animals were euthanized at week 8, and the remnant kidneys were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR. In the CKD pair-fed groups, blood potassium concentration did not differ significantly, but blood pressure was lower in the potassium-supplemented group. Compared with the basal diet, potassium supplementation decreased renal tubulointerstitial injury and suppressed renal inflammation as evidenced by decreased macrophage infiltration, lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased NF-kappaB activation. These renoprotective effects were associated with downregulation of renal transforming growth facto-beta, upregulation of renal Smad7, and lower blood pressure. Our results show that potassium supplementation can reduce renal inflammation and hence, could modulate the progression of kidney injury in CKD.",

        "abstract": "MIM/MTSS1 is a tissue-specific regulator of plasma membrane dynamics, whose altered expression levels have been linked to cancer metastasis. MIM deforms phosphoinositide-rich membranes through its I-BAR domain and interacts with actin monomers through its WH2 domain. Recent work proposed that MIM also potentiates Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-induced gene expression. Here, we generated MIM mutant mice and found that full-length MIM protein is dispensable for embryonic development. However, MIM-deficient mice displayed a severe urinary concentration defect caused by compromised integrity of kidney epithelia intercellular junctions, which led to bone abnormalities and end-stage renal failure. In cultured kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells, MIM displayed dynamic localization to adherens junctions, where it promoted Arp2/3-mediated actin filament assembly. This activity was dependent on the ability of MIM to interact with both membranes and actin monomers. Furthermore, results from the mouse model and cell culture experiments suggest that full-length MIM is not crucial for Shh signaling, at least during embryogenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that MIM modulates interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane to promote the maintenance of intercellular contacts in kidney epithelia.",

        "abstract": "Background In the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, the impact of serum potassium (sK) on renal outcomes has been controversial. Moreover, the reasons for the potential prognostic value of hypokalemia have not been elucidated. Design, Participants & Measurements 2500 participants with CKD stage 1\u20134 in the Integrated CKD care program Kaohsiung for delaying Dialysis (ICKD) prospective observational study were analyzed and followed up for 2.7 years. Generalized additive model was fitted to determine the cutpoints and the U-shape association between sK and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). sK was classified into five groups with the cutpoints of 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 mEq/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models predicting the outcomes were used. Results The mean age was 62.4 years, mean sK level was 4.2\u00b10.5 mEq/L and average eGFR was 40.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Female vs male, diuretic use vs. non-use, hypertension, higher eGFR, bicarbonate, CRP and hemoglobin levels significantly correlated with hypokalemia. In patients with lower sK, nephrotic range proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia were more prevalent but the use of RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors was less frequent. Hypokalemia was significantly associated with ESRD with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.03\u20133.22) in sK <3.5mEq/L and 1.67 (95% CI,1.19\u20132.35) in sK\u200a=\u200a3.5\u20134 mEq/L, respectively, compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia defined as sK >5 mEq/L conferred 1.6-fold (95% CI,1.09\u20132.34) increased risk of ESRD compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hypokalemia was also associated with rapid decline of renal function defined as eGFR slope below 20% of the distribution range. Conclusion In conclusion, both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with increased risk of ESRD in CKD population. Hypokalemia is related to increased use of diuretics, decreased use of RAS blockade and malnutrition, all of which may impose additive deleterious effects on renal outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nPatients with CKD are more likely than others to have abnormalities in serum potassium (K(+)). Aside from severe hyperkalemia, the clinical significance of K(+) abnormalities is not known. We sought to examine the association of serum K(+) with mortality and hospitalization rates within narrow eGFR strata to understand how the burden of hyperkalemia varies by CKD severity. Associations were examined between serum K(+) and discontinuation of medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which are known to increase serum K(+).\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nA cohort of patients with CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) with serum K(+) data were studied (n=55,266) between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013 (study end). Serum K(+), eGFR, and covariates were considered on a time-updated basis. Mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers were considered per time at risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the study, serum K(+) levels of 5.5-5.9 and \u22656.0 mEq/L were most prevalent at lower eGFR: they were present, respectively, in 1.7% and 0.2% of patient-time for eGFR of 50-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) versus 7.6% and 1.8% of patient-time for eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Serum K(+) level <3.5 mEq/L was present in 1.2%-1.4% of patient-time across eGFR strata. The median follow-up time was 2.76 years. There was a U-shaped association between serum K(+) and mortality; pooled adjusted incidence rate ratios were 3.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.53 to 3.68) and 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 2.52 to 4.34) for K(+) levels <3.5 mEq/L and \u22656.0 mEq/L, respectively. Within eGFR strata, there were U-shaped associations of serum K(+) with rates of MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth hyperkalemia and hypokalemia were independently associated with higher rates of death, MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. Future studies are needed to determine whether interventions targeted at maintaining normal serum K(+) improve outcomes in this population.",

We quantified hyperkalemia monitoring and risks after ACE\u2010I/ARB initiation and developed and validated a hyperkalemia susceptibility score. Methods and Results We evaluated 69 426 new users of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy in the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project with medication initiation from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010, and follow\u2010up for 1 year thereafter. Three fourths (76%) of SCREAM patients had potassium checked within the first year. Potassium >5 and >5.5 mmol/L occurred in 5.6% and 1.7%, respectively. As a comparison, we propensity\u2010matched new ACE\u2010I/ARB users to 20 186 new \u03b2\u2010blocker users in SCREAM: 64% had potassium checked. The occurrence of elevated potassium levels was similar between new \u03b2\u2010blocker and ACE\u2010I/ARB users without kidney disease; only at estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 were risks higher among ACE\u2010I/ARB users. We developed a hyperkalemia susceptibility score that incorporated estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline potassium level, sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the concomitant use of potassium\u2010sparing diuretics in new ACE\u2010I/ARB users; this score accurately predicted 1\u2010year hyperkalemia risk in the SCREAM cohort (area under the curve, 0.845, 95% CI: 0.840\u20130.869) and in a validation cohort from the US\u2010based Geisinger Health System (N=19 524; area under the curve, 0.818, 95% CI: 0.794\u20130.841), with good calibration. Conclusions Hyperkalemia within the first year of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy was relatively uncommon among people with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, but rates were much higher with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. Use of the hyperkalemia susceptibility score may help guide laboratory monitoring and prescribing strategies.",

        "title": "Should we eat more potassium to better control blood pressure in hypertension?",
        "abstract": "Changes in lifestyle and nutrition are recommended as the first-step approach to the management of hypertension by all national and international guidelines. Today, when considering nutritional factors in hypertension, almost all the attention is focused on the reduction of salt intake to improve blood pressure (BP) control. Changes in potassium intake are only briefly evoked in guidelines. Few physicians actually think about proposing to eat more foods that are high in potassium (fruits, vegetables, nuts) to better control BP. Yet, during the last 40\u2009years, increasing evidence has accumulated demonstrating that increasing potassium intake, either with food products or with supplements, is associated with significant reductions of both systolic and diastolic BP. The hypotensive effect of potassium is particularly marked in patients with hypertension and in subjects with a very high sodium intake, suggesting that potassium counterbalances the effects of sodium. In addition, several meta-analyses have now confirmed that high potassium intake reduces the risk of stroke by \u223c 25%. Finally, increasing potassium in the diet may perhaps be beneficial for some renal patients, as post hoc analyses have suggested that a high potassium intake may retard the decline of renal function in patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. However, high potassium intake may be risky and sometimes even dangerous in hypertensive patients with CKD stages 3-5, specifically diabetics. In this context, however, as the level of evidence remains low, more prospective clinical studies are needed. The goal of this review is to discuss the actual evidence that supports the recommendation to eat more potassium in order to better control BP in essential hypertension and to review the restrictions in CKD patients with hypertension.",

In patients with CKD, sodium\u2012glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors provide cardiorenal protection, but whether they affect the risk of hyperkalaemia remains uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe CREDENCE trial randomized 4401 participants with T2DM and CKD to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or matching placebo. In this post hoc analysis using an intention-to-treat approach, we assessed the effect of canagliflozin on a composite outcome of time to either investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or the initiation of potassium binders. We also analysed effects on central laboratory-determined hyper- and hypokalaemia (serum potassium \u22656.0 and <3.5\u2009mmol/L, respectively) and change in serum potassium. At baseline, the mean serum potassium in canagliflozin and placebo arms was 4.5\u2009mmol/L; 4395 (99.9%) participants were receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade. The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo [occurring in 32.7 vs. 41.9 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95, P\u2009=\u20090.014]. Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P\u2009=\u20090.031), with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.20, P\u2009=\u20090.53). The mean serum potassium over time with canagliflozin was similar to that of placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.",

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiorenal events in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease. However, their effect on hyperkalemia has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease in whom serum potassium levels were routinely measured. The primary outcome was time to serious hyperkalemia, defined as central laboratory\u2013determined serum potassium \u22656.0 mmol/L, with other outcomes including investigator-reported hyperkalemia events and hypokalemia (serum potassium \u22643.5 mmol/L). Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate treatment effects from each trial with hazards ratios and corresponding 95% CIs pooled with random-effects models to obtain summary treatment effects, overall and across key subgroups. Results: Results from 6 trials were included comprising 49\u2009875 participants assessing 4 SGLT2 inhibitors. Of these, 1754 participants developed serious hyperkalemia, and an additional 1119 investigator-reported hyperkalemia events were recorded. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of serious hyperkalemia (hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76\u20130.93]), an effect consistent across studies (Pheterogeneity=0.71). The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalemia was also lower with SGLT2 inhibitors (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68\u20130.93]; Pheterogeneity=0.21). Reductions in serious hyperkalemia were observed across a range of subgroups, including baseline kidney function, history of heart failure, and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor, diuretic, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94\u20131.15]; Pheterogeneity=0.42).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) finerenone all individually reduce cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria. However, the lifetime benefits of combination therapy with these medicines are not known. METHODS: We used data from 2 SGLT2i trials (CANVAS [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment] and CREDENCE [Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation]), 2 ns-MRA trials (FIDELIO-DKD [Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease] and FIGARO-DKD [Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Clinical Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease]), and 8 GLP-1 RA trials to estimate the relative effects of combination therapy versus conventional care (renin-angiotensin system blockade and traditional risk factor control) on cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes. Using actuarial methods, we then estimated absolute risk reductions with combination SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio \u226530 mg/g) by applying estimated combination treatment effects to participants receiving conventional care in CANVAS and CREDENCE. RESULTS: Compared with conventional care, the combination of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.55\u20130.76) for major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death). The corresponding estimated absolute risk reduction over 3 years was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.0\u20135.7), with a number needed to treat of 23 (95% CI, 18\u201333). For a 50-year-old patient commencing combination therapy, estimated major adverse cardiovascular event\u2013free survival was 21.1 years compared with 17.9 years for conventional care (3.2 years gained [95% CI, 2.1\u20134.3]). There were also projected gains in survival free from hospitalized heart failure (3.2 years [95% CI, 2.4\u20134.0]), chronic kidney disease progression (5.5 years [95% CI, 4.0\u20136.7]), cardiovascular death (2.2 years [95% CI, 1.2\u20133.0]), and all-cause death (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.4\u20133.4]). Attenuated but clinically relevant gains in event-free survival were observed in analyses assuming 50% additive effects of combination therapy, including for major adverse cardiovascular events (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.1\u20133.5]), chronic kidney disease progression (4.5 years [95% CI, 2.8\u20135.9]), and all-cause death (1.8 years [95% CI, 0.7\u20132.8]). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria, combination treatment of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA has the potential to afford relevant gains in cardiovascular and kidney event-free and overall survival.",

        "title": "Chronic Kidney Disease in the Older Adult Patient with Diabetes",
        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common in middle aged and older adult individuals. DM may accelerate the aging process, and the age-related declines in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can pose a challenge to diagnosing diabetic kidney disease (DKD) using standard diagnostic criteria especially with the absence of severe albuminuria among older adults. In the presence of CKD and DM, older adult patients may need multidisciplinary care due to susceptibility to various health issues, e.g., cognitive decline, auditory or visual impairment, various comorbidities, complex medical regimens, and increased sensitivity to medication adverse effects. As a result, it can be challenging to apply recent therapeutic advancements for the general population to older adults. We review the evidence that the benefits from these newer therapies apply equally to older and younger patients with CKD and diabetes type 2 and propose a comprehensive management. This framework will address nonpharmacological measures and pharmacological management with renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), non-steroidal mineralocorticoids receptor antagonists (MRAs), and glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs).",

        "explanation": "This paper reviews the evidence for the benefits of newer therapies, including SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and non-steroidal mineralocorticoids receptor antagonists, in older adult patients with CKD and diabetes, which is related to the source paper's focus on combination treatment with these medications in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria. The paper uses the source paper's findings as a sub-hypothesis to explore the benefits of these therapies in older adult patients."
