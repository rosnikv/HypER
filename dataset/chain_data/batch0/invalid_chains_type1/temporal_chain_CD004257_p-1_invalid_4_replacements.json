        "abstract": "Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, and placebo were compared to determine their efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis of the knee. In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose, parallel-design studies, patients with osteoarthritis aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 60.6 \u00b1 12.8 years were randomized to daily doses of 660 mg naproxen sodium (440 mg naproxen sodium in patients \u226565 years), 4000 mg acetaminophen, or placebo for 7 days. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in pain at rest, on passive motion, on weight-bearing, stiffness after rest (morning), day and night pain compared with placebo, and significantly greater relief from resting pain than acetaminophen (P < 0.05). Acetaminophen provided significantly greater improvements in day pain compared with placebo. Daily evaluations showed naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided superior pain relief to acetaminophen and was significantly better than acetaminophen at reducing difficulties experienced in walking several blocks and difficulties in bending, lifting, and stooping. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) and acetaminophen (4000 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mobility level, household tasks, and walking and bending. Patient and investigator evaluation scores were significantly higher in naproxen sodium and acetaminophen groups compared with placebo; no differences were observed between active treatments. Naproxen sodium and acetaminophen had similar safety profiles to placebo. Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) effectively relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis. Naproxen sodium is an alternative in the initial treatment of osteoarthritis and may be preferred to acetaminophen as first-line therapy in patients with moderate or severe pain.",

While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.",

Objective: Characterize ASS in APAP hepatotoxicity. Methods: ASS was measured in plasma from rodents and humans with APAP hepatotoxicity. Results: In mice, ASS increased before injury, peaked before alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased rapidly. Fischer rats had a greater increase in ASS relative to ALT. Patients with abnormal liver test results had very high ASS compared to controls. ASS appeared to increase early in some patients, and declined rapidly in all.

        "title": "Acetaminophen: Dose-Dependent Drug Hepatotoxicity and Acute Liver Failure in Patients",
        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced liver injury is a rare but serious clinical problem. A number of drugs can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure at therapeutic doses in a very limited number of patients (<1:10,000). This idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, which is currently not predictable in preclinical safety studies, appears to depend on individual susceptibility and the inability to adapt to the cellular stress caused by a particular drug. In striking contrast to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, drugs with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity are mostly detected during preclinical studies and do not reach the market. One notable exception is acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol), which is a safe drug at therapeutic doses but can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure after intentional and unintentional overdoses. Key Messages: APAP overdose is responsible for more acute liver failure cases in the USA or UK than all other etiologies combined. Since APAP overdose in the mouse represents a model for the human pathophysiology, substantial progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of cell death, liver injury and recovery. More recently, emerging evidence based on mechanistic biomarker analysis in patients and studies of cell death in human hepatocytes suggests that most of the mechanisms discovered in mice also apply to patients. The rapid development of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote against APAP overdose was based on the early understanding of APAP toxicity in mice. However, despite the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in patients who present early after APAP overdose, there is a need to develop intervention strategies for late-presenting patients. Conclusions: The challenges related to APAP toxicity are to better understand the mechanisms of cell death in order to limit liver injury and prevent acute liver failure, and also to develop biomarkers that better predict as early as possible who is at risk for developing acute liver failure with poor outcome.",

        "title": "Selection of NSAIDs for rational pharmacotherapy of chronic musculoskeletal pain: a clinical pharmacologist's perspective",
        "abstract": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) is one of the most common pathological conditions that limits patients' physical activity and reduces their quality of life. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) make them the basis of pharmacotherapy for patients with chronic conditions affecting various parts of the musculoskeletal system. The main target of NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase (COX), exists in the form of two main isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, the inhibition of each of which leads to a cascade of reactions at the cellular and tissue level that can cause both targeted pharmacological effects and side effects. The diversity of the chemical structures of NSAIDs leads to differences in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters and correspondingly to differences in their efficacy and safety profile. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, coxibs, have shown an increased risk of cardiovascular side effects, which has led to significant restrictions on their use. Cardiotoxicity is not as pronounced with the non-selective COX inhibitors, but the range of their side effects is extremely wide. These side effects are dose-dependent and are characteristic, first of all, of systemic NSAIDs.The combination of systemic and topical NSAIDs makes it possible to reduce the dose of the former and improve the safety profile of anti-inflammatory therapy. Among the non-selective COX inhibitors with a satisfactory safety profile and high anti-inflammatory activity, the group of oxicams and especially tenoxicam should be emphasised, which are characterised by a maximum duration of action, which is an advantage in the treatment of patients with CMSP. This review addresses the issues of rational selection of NSAIDs based on comparative data on pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and clinical trial results.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs were discovered more than 2 decades ago and have profound impact on diverse biological processes. Specific microRNAs have important roles in modulating the innate immune response and their dysregulation has been demonstrated to contribute to inflammatory diseases. MiR\u2010223 in particular, is very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It functions as key modulator for the differentiation and activation of myeloid cells. The central role of miR\u2010223 in myeloid cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage differentiation and activation has been studied extensively. MiR\u2010223 contributes to myeloid differentiation by enhancing granulopoiesis while inhibiting macrophage differentiation. Uncontrolled myeloid activation has detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. MiR\u2010223 serves as a negative feedback mechanism controlling excessive innate immune responses in the maintenance of myeloid cell homeostasis. This review summarizes several topics covering the function of miR\u2010223 in myeloid differentiation, neutrophil and macrophage functions, as well as in inflammatory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, nonmyeloid functions of miR\u2010223 are also discussed in this review. Therapeutic enhancement of miR\u2010223 to dampen inflammatory targets is also highlighted as potential treatment to control excessive innate immune responses during mucosal inflammation.",

        "title": "MicroRNA expression signatures of atrial fibrillation: The critical systematic review and bioinformatics analysis",
        "abstract": "Association between microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures and atrial fibrillation has been evaluated with inconsistent findings in different studies. This study aims to identify miRNAs that actually play vital role in pathophysiological process of atrial fibrillation and explore miRNA-targeted genes and the involved pathways. Relevant studies were retrieved from the electronic databases of Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library to determine the miRNA expression profiles between atrial fibrillation subjects and non-atrial fibrillation controls. Robustness of results was assessed using sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed based on species, miRNA detection method, sample source, and ethnicity. Quality assessment of studies was independently conducted according to QUADAS-2. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to explore the potential genes and pathways associated with atrial fibrillation, which were targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. Form of pooled results was shown as log10 odds ratios (logORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and random-effects model was used. In total, 40 articles involving 283 differentially expressed miRNAs were reported. And 51 significantly dysregulated miRNAs were identified in consistent direction, with 22 upregulated and 29 downregulated. Among above-mentioned miRNAs, miR-223-3p (logOR 6.473; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was the most upregulated, while miR-1-5p (logOR 7.290; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was the most downregulated. Subgroup analysis confirmed 53 significantly dysregulated miRNAs (21 upregulated and 32 downregulated) in cardiac tissue, with miRNA-1-5p and miRNA-223-3p being the most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs, respectively. Additionally, miR-328 and miR-1-5p were highly blood-specific, and miR-133 was animal-specific. In the detection method sub-groups, miRNA-29b and miRNA-223-3p were differentially expressed consistently. Four miRNAs, including miRNA-223-3p, miRNA-21, miRNA-328, and miRNA-1-5p, were consistently dysregulated in both Asian and non-Asian. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that 47 out of 51 (92.16%) miRNAs were dysregulated consistently. Totally, 51 consistently dysregulated miRNAs associated with atrial fibrillation were confirmed in this study. Five important miRNAs, including miR-29b, miR-328, miR-1-5p, miR-21, and miR-223-3p may act as potential biomarkers for atrial fibrillation. Impact statement Atrial fibrillation (AF) is considered as the most common arrhythmia, and it subsequently causes serious complications including thrombosis and heart failure that increase the social burden. The definite mechanisms underlying AF pathogenesis remain complicated and unclear. Many studies attempted to discover the transcriptomic changes using microarray technologies, and the present studies for this hot topic have assessed individual miRNAs profiles for AF. However, results of different articles are controversial and not each reported miRNA is actually associated with the pathogenesis of AF. The present systematic review and meta-analysis identified that 51 consistently dysregulated miRNAs were associated with AF. Of these miRNAs, five miRNAs (miRNA-1-5p, miRNA-328, miRNA-29b, miRNA-21, and miRNA-223-3p) may act as novel biomarkers for AF. The findings could offer a better description of the biological characteristics of miRNAs, meanwhile might serve as new target for the intervention and monitoring AF in future studies.",

The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased worldwide in conjunction with the expansion of the Western lifestyle. Furthermore, patients with T2DM have been documented to have an increased risk of HCC, as well as bile tract cancer. Growing evidence shows that T2DM is a strong additive metabolic risk factor for HCC, but how diabetes affects the incidence of HCC requires additional investigation. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of HCC in patients with T2DM. Topics covered include abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance; the effect of activated platelets; hub gene expression associated with HCC; inflammation and signaling pathways; miRNAs; altered gut microbiota and immunomodulation. The evidence suggests that reducing obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis through efficient measures of prevention may lead to decreased rates of T2DM-related HCC.",

Hepatokines, stellakines, adipokines, and myokines secreted by hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, adipose tissue, and myocytes play an important role in the occurrence and development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) contributes to the progression of NAFLD by mediating liver inflammation, immune response, hepatocyte death, and later compensatory proliferation. In this review, we first discuss the crosstalk and interaction between hepatokines, stellakines, adipokines, and myokines and NF-\u03baB in NAFLD. The characterization of the crosstalk of NF-\u03baB with these factors will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of NAFLD.

        "abstract": "Background: Neutrophils are key mediators of inflammation during acute liver injury (ALI). Emerging evidence suggests that they also contribute to injury resolution and tissue repair. However, the different neutrophil subsets involved in these processes and their kinetics are undefined. Herein, we characterized neutrophil kinetics and heterogeneity during ALI. Methods: We used the carbon tetrachloride model of ALI and employed flow cytometry, tissue imaging, and quantitative RT-PCR to characterize intrahepatic neutrophils during the necroinflammatory early and late repair phases of the wound healing response to ALI. We FACS sorted intrahepatic neutrophils at key time points and examined their transcriptional profiles using RNA-sequencing. Finally, we evaluated neutrophil protein translation, mitochondrial function and metabolism, reactive oxygen species content, and neutrophil extracellular traps generation. Results: We detected 2 temporarily distinct waves of neutrophils during (1) necroinflammation (at 24 hours after injury) and (2) late repair (at 72 hours). Early neutrophils were proinflammatory, characterized by: (1) upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, (2) activation of the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway, (3) reduction of protein translation, (4) decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and (5) higher propensity to generate reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps. In contrast, late neutrophils were prorepair and enriched in genes and pathways associated with tissue repair and angiogenesis. Finally, early proinflammatory neutrophils were characterized by the expression of a short isoform of C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, while the late prorepair neutrophils were characterized by the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4. Conclusions: This study underscores the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and their dual role in inflammation and tissue repair during ALI.",
