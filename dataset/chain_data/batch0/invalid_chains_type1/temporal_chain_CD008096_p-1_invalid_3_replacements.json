        "abstract": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have largely replaced nasogastric tubes (NGT) for nutritional support of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing curative (chemo)radiotherapy without any good scientific basis. A randomized trial was conducted to compare PEG tubes and NGT in terms of nutritional outcomes, complications, patient satisfaction and cost. The study was closed early because of poor accrual, predominantly due to patients\u2019 reluctance to be randomized. There were 33 patients eligible for analysis. Nutritional support with both tubes was good. There were no significant differences in overall complication rates, chest infection rates or in patients\u2019 assessment of their overall quality of life. The cost of a PEG tube was 10 times that of an NGT. The duration of use of PEG tubes was significantly longer, a median 139\u2003days compared with a median 66\u2003days for NGT. We found no evidence to support the routine use of PEG tubes over NGT in this patient group.",

        "abstract": "Patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancers often experience significant complications. We sought to evaluate the impact of prophylactic gastrostomy tubes (PGTs) among these patients on four easily evaluable adverse outcomes, namely, absolute weight loss, percentage weight loss, admissions for nutritional reasons and treatment interruptions. A retrospective review was carried out on patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for primary head and neck cancers from September 1999 to October 2005 at the Wellington Blood and Cancer Centre (n\u2003=\u200371). PGTs were placed in 7 (10%) patients. Patients with PGTs were compared with the patients without PGTs (the control group) by univariate and multivariate analyses. By univariate analysis, there was no significant difference in absolute or percentage weight loss between those with PGTs and the control group. By multivariate analysis, those with PGTs lost 5.2% (P\u2003=\u20030.016) less weight than the control group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to admissions for nutritional reasons or treatment interruptions. The use of PGTs can reduce weight loss in patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, and its use should be further evaluated in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Objective To understand the impact of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement timing on tube duration, weight loss, and disease control in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Setting A tertiary academic center. Study Design Historical cohort study. Subjects and Methods Seventy-four patients with HNC were reviewed. Patients underwent cisplatinum-based chemoradiation therapy with or without surgical resection. They received a PEG tube either before radiation therapy began (prophylactic) or after (reactive). Patients were matched on the basis of age, gender, TNM stage, tumor subsite, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and chemoradiation dose. Results Patients receiving reactive PEG tubes had them in place for fewer days than those placed prophylactically (227 vs 139 days, P < .01). There was no difference in percentage weight loss at 2, 6, or 12 months. There was no difference in survival or disease control between the groups. Conclusions Reactive PEG tube placement may afford patients a shorter duration of usage without incurring greater weight loss or poorer oncologic outcomes.",

        "title": "The provision of enteral nutritional support during definitive chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients",
        "abstract": "Combination chemoradiation is the gold standard of management for locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. One of the most significant advantages of this approach to treatment is organ preservation which may not be possible with radical surgery. Unfortunately, few treatments are without side\u2010effects and the toxicity associated with combined modality treatment causes meaningful morbidity. Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) may have difficulties meeting their nutritional requirements as a consequence of tumour location or size or because of the acute toxicity associated with treatment. In particular, severe mucositis, xerostomia, dysgeusia and nausea and vomiting limit intake. In addition to this, dysphagia is often present at diagnosis, with many patients experiencing silent aspiration. As such, many patients will require enteral nutrition in order to complete chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Feeding occurs via catheters placed transnasally (nasogastric tubes) or directly into the stomach through the anterior abdominal wall (percutaneous gastrostomy tubes). In the absence of clear evidence concerning the superiority of one method over another, the choice of feeding tube tends to be dependent on clinician and patient preference. This review examines key issues associated with the provision of enteral nutritional support during definitive CRT in HNC patients, including feeding methods, patient outcomes and timing of tube insertion and use.",

        "title": "Indicators for Enteral Nutrition Use and Prophylactic Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Placement in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy",
        "abstract": "Background: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a major risk factor for malnutrition and dehydration in patients with head and neck cancer. Enteral support is often needed, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is frequently placed. Specific indicators for PEG placement remain unclear. This study retrospectively determined which factors contributed to enteral nutrition (EN) use and PEG placement in a large patient group to gain insight on potential indicators for PEG placement protocol creation. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 240 patients with head and neck cancer who underwent CRT in 2012\u20132015 was conducted. Lifestyle, oncological, treatment, and nutrition outcome characteristics were examined and compared between patients who used EN and those who did not, as well as between patients who received a PEG and those who did not. Results: In total, 195 patients used EN (via PEG or nasogastric tube). Multivariate analysis showed that nodal disease presence (P = .01) and bilateral neck irradiation (P = .01) were significantly related to EN use while increased age (P = .01), nodal disease presence (P = .02), reconstruction extent other than primary closure (P = .02), bilateral neck irradiation (P < .01), and an adapted intake consistency prior to treatment (P = .03) were significantly related to PEG placement. Conclusion: Important factors for EN usage and PEG placement consideration include nodal disease and planned bilateral neck irradiation. Results from this study in combination with existing literature can be taken into consideration in the design of a PEG placement protocol. A better understanding of predictive indicators to PEG placement should be explored in further prospective studies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies on the assessment of sarcopenia and its predictive and prognostic value in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Recent findings There is increasing evidence that low skeletal muscle mass (SMM), often named sarcopenia, can easily be assessed on cross-sectional imaging of the head and neck and is associated with chemotherapy (dose limiting) and radiotherapy toxicity and survival. Summary SMM measurement at the level of the third cervical vertebra (C3) on routine computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is easy and robust to perform. Several studies have shown a significantly higher incidence of cisplatin dose limiting toxicity in HNC patients with a low SMM. In HNC patients pretreatment low SMM is associated with acute and late toxicity and adverse events of radiotherapy, complications of major head and neck surgery and decreased disease-specific and overall survival. This information can be used for individualized treatment planning in HNC patients with low SMM.",

        "title": "Low dose cisplatin weekly versus high dose cisplatin every three weeks in primary chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients with low skeletal muscle mass: The CISLOW-study protocol",
        "abstract": "Chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin in a triweekly regimen of 100 mg/m2 body surface area, is used to treat locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with curative intent. Cisplatin dose limiting toxicity (CDLT) occurs often and impedes obtaining the planned cumulative cisplatin dose. A cumulative cisplatin dose of 200 mg/m2 or more is warranted for better survival and locoregional control. Patients with a low skeletal muscle mass (SMM) have a three-fold higher risk of developing CDLT than patients with a normal SMM. SMM can be assessed through measurements on routinely performed diagnostic head and neck CT- or MRI-scans. A weekly regimen of 40 mg/m2 body surface area cisplatin is proposed as a less toxic schedule, which possibly decreases the risk of developing CDLT and enables reaching a higher cumulative cisplatin dose. The aim of this multicenter randomized clinical trial (NL76533.041.21, registered in the Netherlands Trial Register) is to identify whether a regimen of weekly cisplatin increases compliance to the planned chemotherapy scheme in HNSCC patients with low SMM. The primary outcome is the difference in compliance rate, defined as absence of CDLT, between low SMM patients receiving either the weekly or triweekly regimen. Secondary outcomes consist of toxicities, the cumulative cisplatin dose, time to recurrence, incidence of recurrence at two years of follow-up, location of recurrence, 2-year overall, disease free and disease specific survival, quality of life, patient\u2019s experiences, and cost-effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) is the standard treatment for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although dosing is based on body surface area (BSA), some patients experience CDDP-related adverse events (AEs). We aimed to evaluate the impact of relative CDDP dose to skeletal muscle mass (SMM) on chemotherapy-associated AEs in patients with HNSCC undergoing CRT with high-dose CDDP. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent CRT with high-dose CDDP (80-100 mg/m2, triweekly) between 2010 and 2023. SMM was measured as the cross-sectional muscle area at the third cervical vertebra (C3-SMM) using computed tomography; the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as SMM normalized by squared height. The CDDP index was defined as the prescribed CDDP dose divided by SMI. CDDP-related AEs were assessed during the first cycle using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Results Overall, 306 patients were identified. The CDDP index cutoff value best associated with grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 AEs was 10.312. Grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 hematological toxicities exhibited stronger association with high CDDP index value than with low CDDP index value (26.9% vs 16.3%, P\u2005=\u2005.033). Multivariate analysis revealed that high CDDP index value and creatinine clearance\u2005<\u200570 mL/minute were predictive factors for grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 AEs (odds ratio [OR] 2.55, P\u2005=\u2005.008; OR 3.68, P\u2005=\u2005.002, respectively). Conclusion The CDDP index based on C3-SMM was an independent predictive factor for grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 CDDP-related AEs. C3-SMM is potentially more useful than BSA for determining the optimal CDDP dose in patients with HNSCC.",
