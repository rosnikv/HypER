        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo study appetite and food choices in lean elderly women at the time of a femoral neck fracture and after 6 months of nutritional and anabolic intervention.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nForty-five nondemented women >70 years of age (mean +/- SD: 83 +/- 5 years) with a recent hip fracture and body mass index <24 kg/m2 (mean: 20.5 +/- 2.3) were interviewed about their appetite and dietary habits prior to fracture. The patients were randomized to treatment with a protein-rich liquid supplement (PR; 200 kcal and 20 g protein day(-1)) alone or in combination with nandrolone decanoate injections (PR/N) 25 mg i.m. every third week or to a control group (C). A second interview was conducted 6 months later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReduced appetite before the fracture was reported by 60%. Half of the patients did not have dessert with any of their daily meals, one-third used low-fat margarines and one-third drank water with their meals. The estimated mean daily energy intake was 6.4 +/- 1.2 MJ (1541 +/- 304 kcal) indicating that three of four subjects did not meet their energy needs. At 6 months, 40% reported reduced appetite. There was no difference in the change of appetite between the three randomized groups. Still, half of the subjects appeared to not meet their energy needs. Protein intake increased in the PR and PR/N groups, in contrast to the controls (P = 0.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReduced appetite and insufficient energy intake was recorded in lean elderly women with a femoral neck fracture. Nutritional supplementation alone or in combination with an anabolic steroid increased protein intake without adversely affecting appetite.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Dementia is common in elderly patients, and anaesthesiologists are increasingly challenged in managing these patients who are especially vulnerable. The aim of this article is to highlight some of the most important perioperative issues relating to demented patients, both regarding anaesthesia and other aspects that should be considered to ensure a quick and uncomplicated recovery. Recent findings Demented patients often receive prescribed medication that can interact with various anaesthetic drugs and cause serious side effects. The anaesthesiologist should consider this when choosing the drugs used during surgery and when relieving postoperative pain. Generally, hypnotics, opioids, and inhalational anaesthetics should be administered in lower doses and carefully titrated because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics leading to a great variability, as documented in elderly patients. Neuromuscular blocking agents, and especially rocuronium, display an increased variability in the duration of action, but the new drug sugammadex may reverse the neuromuscular block in a few minutes. Postoperative cognitive decline is more frequent in elderly patients with preexisting cognitive impairment and several preventive measurements can be provided. Summary Outpatient surgery for demented patients causes many concerns in relation to anaesthesia. Extensive drug-related problems may arise and restrictive drug usage is recommended to avoid serious complications.",

        "abstract": "We performed untargeted metabolomics in plasma of B6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) at the chronic phase of the disease in search of an altered metabolic pathway(s). Of 324 metabolites measured, 100 metabolites that mapped to various pathways (mainly lipids) linked to mitochondrial function, inflammation, and membrane stability were observed to be significantly altered between EAE and control (p < 0.05, false discovery rate <0.10). Bioinformatics analysis revealed six metabolic pathways being impacted and altered in EAE, including \u03b1-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism (PUFA). The metabolites of PUFAs, including \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 fatty acids, are commonly decreased in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in patients with MS. Daily oral administration of resolvin D1, a downstream metabolite of \u03c9-3, decreased disease progression by suppressing autoreactive T cells and inducing an M2 phenotype of monocytes/macrophages and resident brain microglial cells. This study provides a proof of principle for the application of metabolomics to identify an endogenous metabolite(s) possessing drug-like properties, which is assessed for therapy in preclinical mouse models of MS.",

Cognition was assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CamCog). Tryptophan, kynurenines, neopterin, and vitamin B6 forms were measured in plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Non-parametric statistics, logistic regression and standardized robust regressions were applied with a false discovery rate of 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTryptophan, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid were lower in AD (Odds ratios (ORs) 0.24 -0.47; p-values <0.001 -0.01). Pyridoxal 5'phosphate did not differ between AD and controls. Kynurenine, anthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, and markers of immune activation (neopterin, kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, and the PAr index (Pyridoxic acid/(Pyridoxal 5'phosphate + Pyridoxal)) increased with age (\u03b2 0.31 -0.51; p-values <0.001 -0.006). Xanthurenic acid decreased with age (\u03b2: -0.42, p\u200a<\u200a0.001).

Low xanthurenic acid occurred in both AD and with aging. Inflammation-related markers were associated with age, but not AD.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with cerebral accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau. In the past 28 years, huge efforts have been made in attempting to treat the disease by reducing brain accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with no success. While anti-amyloid-\u03b2 therapies continue to be tested in prodromal patients with Alzheimer's disease and in subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need to provide therapeutic support to patients with established Alzheimer's disease for whom current symptomatic treatment (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl d-aspartate antagonist) provide limited help. The possibility of an infectious aetiology for Alzheimer's disease has been repeatedly postulated over the past three decades. Infiltration of the brain by pathogens may act as a trigger or co-factor for Alzheimer's disease, with Herpes simplex virus type 1, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Porphyromonas gingivalis being most frequently implicated. These pathogens may directly cross a weakened blood-brain barrier, reach the CNS and cause neurological damage by eliciting neuroinflammation. Alternatively, pathogens may cross a weakened intestinal barrier, reach vascular circulation and then cross blood-brain barrier or cause low grade chronic inflammation and subsequent neuroinflammation from the periphery. The gut microbiota comprises a complex community of microorganisms. Increased permeability of the gut and blood-brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may impact Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Inflammatory microorganisms in gut microbiota are associated with peripheral inflammation and brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposition in subjects with cognitive impairment. Oral microbiota may also influence Alzheimer's disease risk through circulatory or neural access to the brain. At least two possibilities can be envisaged to explain the association of suspected pathogens and Alzheimer's disease. One is that patients with Alzheimer's disease are particularly prone to microbial infections. The other is that microbial infection is a contributing cause of Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic trials with antivirals and/or antibacterials could resolve this dilemma. Indeed, antiviral agents are being tested in patients with Alzheimer's disease in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Although combined antibiotic therapy was found to be effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, antibacterial drugs are not being widely investigated in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This is because it is not clear which bacterial populations in the gut of patients with Alzheimer's disease are overexpressed and if safe, selective antibacterials are available for them. On the other hand, a bacterial protease inhibitor targeting P. gingivalis toxins is now being tested in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Clinical studies are needed to test if countering bacterial infection may be beneficial in patients with established Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, 50 million people suffer from dementia, a group of symptoms affecting cognitive and social functions, progressing severely enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) accounts for most of the dementia cases. Pathological and clinical findings have led to proposing several hypotheses of AD pathogenesis, finding a presence of positive feedback loops and additionally observing the disturbance of a branch of tryptophan metabolism, the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Either causative or resultant of dementia, elevated levels of neurotoxic KYN metabolites are observed, potentially upregulating multiple feedback loops of AD pathogenesis. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamatergic receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, which belongs to one of only two classes of medications approved for clinical use, but other NMDAR modulators have been explored so far in vain. An endogenous KYN pathway metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), likewise inhibits the excitotoxic NMDAR. Besides its anti-excitotoxicity, KYNA is a multitarget compound that triggers anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Modifying the KYNA level is a potential multitarget strategy to normalize the disturbed KYN pathway and thus to alleviate juxtaposing AD pathogeneses. In this review, the maintenance of KYN metabolism by modifying the level of KYNA is proposed and discussed in search for a novel lead compound against the progression of dementia.",

        "abstract": "Aims: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is the decline in cognitive function of the central nervous system (CNS) after anesthesia/surgery. The present study explored whether anesthesia/surgery altered gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, examining their associations with risk factors of cognitive dysfunction in aged mice. Methods: Sixteen-month-old C57BL/6 mice underwent abdominal surgery under isoflurane anesthesia to establish an animal model of POCD. The Morris water maze test (MWMT) was used as an indicator of memory after surgery. The effects of anesthesia/surgical interventions on gut microbiota, fecal metabolites, hippocampus, and serum levels of inflammatory factors were examined. Results: The anesthesia/surgery induced more serious POCD behavior, increasing brain interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2 levels than sham control mice. The relative abundance of bacterial genera Bacteroidales_unclassified, Mucispirillum, and Clostridiales_unclassified declined, whereas that of Escherichia\u2013Shigella, actinomyces, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, and Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group were enriched after anesthesia/surgery compared to the baseline controls. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) showed that the metabolites differed between post-anesthesia+surgery (post_A + S) and baseline samples and were associated with the fecal metabolism of tryptophan, kynurenic acid, N-oleoyl \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 2-indolecarboxylic acid, and glutamic acid. Furthermore, the differential metabolites were associated with alterations in the abundance of specific bacteria. These results indicate that the POCD intervention may be achieved by targeting specific bacteria associated with neurotransmitter metabolism. Conclusions: A transient cognitive disturbance induced by anesthesia/surgery may be associated with unfavorable alterations in gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, thereby contributing to the POCD development.",

The transport rates of the antimicrobial qac across the individual membranes of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as liposomes composed of the polar lipid extract of E. coli, were directly measured using time-resolved SHS. Whereas exogenous indole was shown to induce a 2-fold increase in the transport rate of the qac across the cytoplasmic membranes of the wild-type bacteria, it had no influence on a knockout strain of E. coli lacking the tryptophan-specific transport protein (\u0394mtr). Likewise, indole did not affect the transport rate of the qac diffusing across the liposome membrane.
