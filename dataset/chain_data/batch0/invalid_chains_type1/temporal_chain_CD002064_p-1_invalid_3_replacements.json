        "abstract": "Troglitazone (TGZ), an antidiabetic drug that improves insulin\u2010resistance in the peripheral tissues, was tested for neurotrophic activity in motoneurones and other neurones in culture. In rat motoneurones, TGZ had a remarkable effect on survival, which was comparable or superior to that of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor, a known potent neurotrophic factor for rat motoneurones. However, TGZ did not promote the survival of sensory, sympathetic, septal or hippocampal neurones. The effect of TGZ on motoneurones was additive to that of insulin\u2010like growth factor\u2010I and both activities were inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3\u2010kinase) inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, suggesting the involvement of the activation of PI3\u2010kinase in the activity of TGZ. Pioglitazone, another antidiabetic drug structurally similar to TGZ, did not show any activity, indicating that the agonistic activity of TGZ for peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 is not involved in the survival activity. Chromanol, an antioxidant moiety of TGZ, showed little or no survival activity. These results indicate specific neurotrophic activity of TGZ for motoneurones through the activation of PI3\u2010kinase and support the applicability of TGZ for the treatment of motor neurone diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is the target of the insulin sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glaucoma and other retinal disorders are some of the major complications in diabetes. In the present study, the role that PPAR-gamma ligands play in protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) against glutamate insult was explored.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTransformed rat RGC (RGC-5 cells) and two PPAR-gamma agonists, 15-deoxy-D(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone were used. RGC-5 cells were incubated with either of the PPAR-gamma ligands and were exposed to either L-glutamic acid or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Cell viability was determined with the neutral red dye uptake assay. Levels of PPAR-gamma receptor proteins were monitored by immunoblot analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGlutamate treatment resulted in RGC-5 cell death, and both 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone protected the RGC-5 cells from glutamate cytotoxicity. The neuroprotective concentrations of both compounds ranged from approximately 1 to 5 micro M. Troglitazone further protected against BSO toxicity, whereas 15d-PGJ2 did not. Glutamate treatment appears to exert its cytotoxicity through oxidative damage, because pretreatment of RGC-5 cells with the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and thiourea resulted in the reversal of glutamate cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the glutamate effect was not reversed by pretreatment with MK801 or DL-threo-betabenzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA), suggesting that glutamate cytotoxicity is not mediated through the NMDA receptor and/or glutamate transporter, respectively. Levels of PPAR-gamma receptor protein did not show any appreciable change in response to glutamate exposure, with or without 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTwo PPAR-gamma ligands, 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, protect RGC-5, an established transformed rat retinal ganglion cell line, against glutamate cytotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of the two compounds appear to be mediated through an antioxidant rather than a PPAR-gamma-dependent pathway. These results suggest that PPAR-gamma agonists, in addition to improving insulin sensitivity, may also provide a valuable antioxidant benefit that could prove valuable in targeting ocular complications including glaucoma.",

        "title": "Serum deprivation induces apoptotic cell death of transformed rat retinal ganglion cells via mitochondrial signaling pathways.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nApoptosis-related signaling pathways were investigated in a cultured rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC-5) line deprived of growth factors after serum withdrawal from the culture medium.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRGC-5 cells were subjected to serum deprivation for 2 to 6 days and compared with RGC-5 cells cultured in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell viability was determined by a neutral red dye uptake assay. Apoptosis of RGC-5 cells was established by DNA laddering. The expression of various apoptosis-related genes was investigated by immunoblot analysis, and or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The redox state of the cell was determined by biochemical methods, including NF-kappaB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) and mitochondrial damage by JC-1 (5,5', 6,6'-tetrachloro 1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide) staining, using live cell confocal microscopy and cytosolic release of cytochrome c.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty percent cell loss was evident after 2 days of serum deprivation, as demonstrated by neutral red dye uptake assay. This cell loss was due to apoptotic cell death, as established by DNA laddering. The oxidative state of serum-deprived RGC-5 cells was perturbed as suggested by the increase in malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in cell lysates. The apoptosis of the RGC-5 cells was associated with the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and increased levels of Bax with corresponding decreases in Bcl-2 levels and NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity. Serum deprivation was also associated with a loss of mitochondrial function, as revealed by cytosolic release of cytochrome c and JC-1 staining of mitochondria of dying RGC-5 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaken together, these results indicate that serum withdrawal induces apoptotic cell death in RGC-5 cells via mitochondrial pathways. These studies lead to the speculation that growth factor deprivation arising from blockade of retrograde transport of neurotrophins may involve similar mechanism(s) of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma.",

        "title": "Oxidative Stress in Glaucoma: A Burden of Evidence",
        "abstract": "G laucoma is an insidiously progressive optic neuropathy which affects nearly 90 million people worldwide, and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. It is a neurodegenerative disorder of aging and occurs with increasing prevalence after the age of 40. Fundoscopic examination of the glaucomatous retina reveals characteristic excavation of the optic nerve head (ONH) with concomitant visual field defects. Although most cases of glaucoma are associated with prolonged latent periods of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), known as primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), approximately one third of glaucoma patients present with normal IOP. Furthermore, a significant number of cases progress despite clinically measurable reductions of IOP.7 Despite this paradox of pressure, the final common pathway of vision loss remains the apoptotic loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with subsequent degeneration of the ONH. Such observations have perpetuated research to determine the etiology of and risk factors for developing glaucoma. In addition to elevated IOP, retinal ischemia, and nutritional status, oxidative stress has been proposed as an etiologic factor in the pathophysiology of glaucomatous RGC death. As central nervous system neurons, RGCs are especially susceptible to oxidative stress because of their tremendous oxygen consumption and high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. But unlike cortical neurons, the RGCs are vulnerable to potentially high levels of oxidative stress as a result of direct light exposure. Oxidative stresses are induced through the formation of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide (O2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (dOH) that can initiate and propagate free radicals. The resultant free radicals can be terminated by antioxidant defense systems including the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and nonenzymatic components such as glutathione [reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG)], thioredoxin, and antioxidant vitamins. The net oxidative burden between these opposing prooxidant and antioxidant systems is the oxidative stress that damages lipids, protein, and DNA culminating in cell death. Despite the potential role of oxidative stress in the glaucomatous death of RGCs, developing neurotrophindependent RGCs require ROS as part of the signaling process for cell death, analogous to that seen in neurotrophin-dependent neurons. Therefore, here we examine studies that attempt to provide evidence for and elucidate the role of oxidative stress in glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Glaucoma is increasingly recognized as a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the accelerated loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Open angle glaucoma prevalence and incidence increase exponentially with increasing age, yet the pathophysiology underlying increasing age as a risk factor for glaucoma is not well understood. Accumulating evidence points to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction playing a key role in the etiology of other neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. The 2 major functions of mitochondria are the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and the regulation of cell death by apoptosis. This review details evidence to support our hypothesis that age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction renders RGCs susceptible to glaucomatous injury by reducing the energy available for repair processes and predisposing RGCs to apoptosis. Eliciting the role of mitochondria in glaucoma pathogenesis may uncover novel therapeutic targets for protecting the optic nerve and preventing vision loss in glaucoma.",

        "title": "Energy metabolism of the visual system.",
        "abstract": "The visual system is one of the most energetically demanding systems in the brain. The currency of energy is ATP, which is generated most efficiently from oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria. ATP supports multiple neuronal functions. Foremost is repolarization of the membrane potential after depolarization. Neuronal activity, ATP generation, blood flow, oxygen consumption, glucose utilization, and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism are all interrelated. In the retina, phototransduction, neurotransmitter utilization, and protein/organelle transport are energy-dependent, yet repolarization-after-depolarization consumes the bulk of the energy. Repolarization in photoreceptor inner segments maintains the dark current. Repolarization by all neurons along the visual pathway following depolarizing excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission preserves cellular integrity and permits reactivation. The higher metabolic activity in the magno- versus the parvo-cellular pathway, the ON- versus the OFF-pathway in some (and the reverse in other) species, and in specialized functional representations in the visual cortex all reflect a greater emphasis on the processing of specific visual attributes. Neuronal activity and energy metabolism are tightly coupled processes at the cellular and even at the molecular levels. Deficiencies in energy metabolism, such as in diabetes, mitochondrial DNA mutation, mitochondrial protein malfunction, and oxidative stress can lead to retinopathy, visual deficits, neuronal degeneration, and eventual blindness.",

        "title": "Low-level light therapy of the eye and brain.",
        "abstract": "Low-level light therapy (LLLT) using red to near-infrared light energy has gained attention in recent years as a new scientific approach with therapeutic applications in ophthalmology, neurology, and psychiatry. The ongoing therapeutic revolution spearheaded by LLLT is largely propelled by progress in the basic science fields of photobiology and bioenergetics. This paper describes the mechanisms of action of LLLT at the molecular, cellular, and nervous tissue levels. Photoneuromodulation of cytochrome oxidase activity is the most important primary mechanism of action of LLLT. Cytochrome oxidase is the primary photoacceptor of light in the red to near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is also a key mitochondrial enzyme for cellular bioenergetics, especially for nerve cells in the retina and the brain. Evidence shows that LLLT can secondarily enhance neural metabolism by regulating mitochondrial function, intraneuronal signaling systems, and redox states. Current knowledge about LLLT dosimetry relevant for its hormetic effects on nervous tissue, including noninvasive in vivo retinal and transcranial effects, is also presented. Recent research is reviewed that supports LLLT potential benefits in retinal disease, stroke, neurotrauma, neurodegeneration, and memory and mood disorders. Since mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in neurodegeneration, LLLT has potential significant applications against retinal and brain damage by counteracting the consequences of mitochondrial failure. Upon transcranial delivery in vivo, LLLT induces brain metabolic and antioxidant beneficial effects, as measured by increases in cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities. Increases in cerebral blood flow and cognitive functions induced by LLLT have also been observed in humans. Importantly, LLLT given at energy densities that exert beneficial effects does not induce adverse effects. This highlights the value of LLLT as a novel paradigm to treat visual, neurological, and psychological conditions, and supports that neuronal energy metabolism could constitute a major target for neurotherapeutics of the eye and brain.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hypometabolism characterizes mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) enhances the metabolic capacity of neurons in culture through photostimulation of cytochrome oxidase, the mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes oxygen consumption in cellular respiration. Growing evidence supports that neuronal metabolic enhancement by LLLT positively impacts neuronal function in vitro and in vivo. Based on its effects on energy metabolism, it is proposed that LLLT will also affect the cerebral cortex in vivo and modulate higher-order cognitive functions such as memory. In vivo effects of LLLT on brain and behavior are poorly characterized. We tested the hypothesis that in vivo LLLT facilitates cortical oxygenation and metabolic energy capacity and thereby improves memory retention. Specifically, we tested this hypothesis in rats using fear extinction memory, a form of memory modulated by prefrontal cortex activation. Effects of LLLT on brain metabolism were determined through measurement of prefrontal cortex oxygen concentration with fluorescent quenching oximetry and by quantitative cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Experiment 1 verified that LLLT increased the rate of oxygen consumption in the prefrontal cortex in vivo. Experiment 2 showed that LLLT-treated rats had an enhanced extinction memory as compared to controls. Experiment 3 showed that LLLT reduced fear renewal and prevented the reemergence of extinguished conditioned fear responses. Experiment 4 showed that LLLT induced hormetic dose-response effects on the metabolic capacity of the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest that LLLT can enhance cortical metabolic capacity and retention of extinction memories, and implicate LLLT as a novel intervention to improve memory.",

        "abstract": "Discovering that transcranial infrared laser stimulation produces beneficial effects on frontal cortex functions such as sustained attention, working memory, and affective state has been groundbreaking. Transcranial laser stimulation with low-power density (mW/cm2) and high-energy density (J/cm2) monochromatic light in the near-infrared wavelengths modulates brain functions and may produce neurotherapeutic effects in a nondestructive and non-thermal manner (Lampl, 2007; Hashmi et al., 2010). Barrett and Gonzalez-Lima (2013) provided the first controlled study showing that transcranial laser stimulation improves human cognitive and emotional brain functions. But for the field of low-level light/laser therapy (LLLT), development of a model of how luminous energy from red-to-near-infrared wavelengths modulates bioenergetics began with in vitro and in vivo discoveries in the last 40 years. Previous LLLT reviews have provided extensive background about historical developments, principles and applications (Rojas and Gonzalez-Lima, 2011, 2013; Chung et al., 2012). The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on LLLT's neurochemical mechanisms supporting transcranial laser stimulation for cognitive-enhancing applications. We will explain first LLLT's action on brain bioenergetics, briefly describe its bioavailability and dose-response, and finish with its beneficial effects on cognitive functions. Although our focus is on prefrontal-related cognitive functions, in principle LLLT should be able to modulate other brain functions. For example, stimulating different brain regions should affect different functions related to sensory and motor systems.",

        "abstract": "In cellular bioenergetics, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) is the enzyme responsible for oxygen consumption in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which drives oxidative phosphorylation for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. CCO is also the major intracellular acceptor of photons in the light wavelengths used for photobiomodulation (PBM). Brain function is critically dependent on oxygen consumption by CCO for ATP production. Therefore, our objectives were (1) to conduct the first detailed brain mapping study of the effects of PBM on regional CCO activity, and (2) to compare the chronic effects of PBM on young and aged brains. Specifically, we used quantitative CCO histochemistry to map the differences in CCO activity of brain regions in healthy young (4 months old) and aged (20 months old) rats from control groups with sham stimulation and from treated groups with 58 consecutive days of transcranial laser PBM (810 nm wavelength and 100 mW power). We found that aging predominantly decreased regional brain CCO activity and systems-level functional connectivity, while the chronic laser stimulation predominantly reversed these age-related effects. We concluded that chronic PBM modified the effects of aging by causing the CCO activity on brain regions in laser-treated aged rats to reach levels similar to those found in young rats. Given the crucial role of CCO in bioenergetics, PBM may be used to augment brain and behavioral functions of older individuals by improving oxidative energy metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Introduction This is the first study mapping the duration of action of in vivo photobiomodulation (PBM) on cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). In cellular bioenergetics, CCO is the terminal rate-limiting enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which catalyzes oxygen utilization for aerobic energy production. PBM using transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) is a promising intervention for non-invasively modulating CCO in the brain. TILS of the human prefrontal cortex directly causes CCO photo-oxidation, which is associated with increased cerebral oxygenation and improved cognition. Methods This experiment aimed to map the duration of action of in vivo PBM on CCO activity in discrete neuroanatomic locations within rat brains up to 4\u2009weeks after a single TILS session (50\u2009s, 1064\u2009nm CW, 250\u2009mW/cm2). Control brains from rats treated with a sham session without TILS (laser off) were compared to brains from TILS-treated rats that were collected 1\u2009day, 2\u2009weeks, or 4\u2009weeks post-TILS. Cryostat sections of the 36 collected brains were processed using quantitative enzyme histochemistry and digitally imaged. Densitometric readings of 28 regions of interest were recorded and converted to CCO activity units of oxygen utilization using calibration standards. Data analysis (ANCOVA) compared each laser-treated group to sham with whole-brain average as a covariate. Results The prefrontal infralimbic cortex showed the earliest significant increase in CCO activity between 1-day post-TILS and sham groups, which continued elevated for 2\u20134\u2009weeks post-TILS. Significant differences in CCO activity between 2-weeks and sham groups were also found in the lateral septum, accumbens core, CA3 of the hippocampus, and the molecular layer of the hippocampus. The medial amygdala showed a significant decrease in CCO activity between 4-weeks and sham. Further analyses showed significant inter-regional CCO activity correlations among the brain regions as the result of TILS, with the most pronounced changes at 4-weeks post-stimulation. Discussion The time course of changes in CCO activity and network connectivity suggested that TILS caused different neuroplasticity types of bioenergetic changes at different time scales, depending on brain region and its depth from the cortex. In conclusion, this controlled CCO histochemical study demonstrated a long-lasting duration of action of PBM in the rat brain.",
