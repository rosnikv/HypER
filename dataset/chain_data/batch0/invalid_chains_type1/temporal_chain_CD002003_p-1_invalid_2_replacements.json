        "title": "Beta-blockers versus diuretics in hypertensive men: main results from the HAPPHY trial.",
        "abstract": "Men aged 40-64 years with mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100-130 mmHg] were randomized to treatment with a diuretic (n = 3272) or a beta-blocker (n = 3297), with additional drugs if necessary, to determine whether a beta-blocker based treatment differs from thiazide diuretic based treatment with regard to the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Patients with previous CHD, stroke or other serious diseases, or with contraindications to diuretics or beta-blockers were excluded. If normotension (DBP less than 95 mmHg) was not achieved by monotherapy, other antihypertensive drugs were added, but the two basic drugs were not crossed over. Patients were assessed at 6-monthly intervals. The mean follow-up for end-points was 45.1 months. Blood pressure (BP) side effects and end-points were recorded in a standardized manner. Entry characteristics and the BP reduction achieved were very similar in both treatment groups. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. The incidence of CHD did not differ between the two treatment groups. The incidence of fatal stroke tended to be lower in the beta-blocker treated group than in the diuretic treated group. Total mortality and the total number of end-points were similar in both groups. The percentage of patients withdrawn due to side effects was similar, whereas the number of reported symptoms, according to a questionnaire, was higher for patients on beta-blockers. The incidence of diabetes did not differ between the two groups. Subgroup analyses did not detect a difference in the effect of beta-blockers compared with diuretics in smokers as opposed to non-smokers, and beta-blockers also had the same effects as diuretics in the quartile with the highest predicted risk for CHD. Beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics were approximately equally well tolerated. The two drugs had a similar BP reducing effect although additional drugs had to be given more often in the diuretic group. Antihypertensive treatment based on a beta-blocker or on a thiazide diuretic could not be shown to affect the prevention of hypertensive complications, including CHD, to a different extent.",

Cases were patients who had high blood pressure treated with medicines and who presented in 1982 to 1984 with angina or fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Controls were a probability sample of health maintenance organization patients with pharmacologically treated hypertension and free of coronary heart disease. Blinded to case-control status, we reviewed the medical records of the 248 cases and 737 controls. The health maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database was used to ascertain the use of \u03b2-blockers. Fewer cases than controls were taking \u03b2-blockers. This difference was confined to those with nonfatal infarctions. After adjustment for confounding, the estimated relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.99). Higher doses of \u03b2-blockers conferred greater protection. We conclude that \u03b2-blockers may prevent first events of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with high blood pressure.

        "title": "Adherence to Medication Regimens: Updating a Complex Medical Issue",
        "abstract": "Clinicians face nonadherence as the norm in everyday medical practice. The literature suggests a number of techniques that are likely to increase adherence when incorporated into regular clinical practices and routines. Central to these guidelines appears to be the doctor-patient relationship. For instance, the physician who uses understandable language, encourages open doctor-patient exchange, fosters participation by patients in their own medical care, and creates a friendly and efficient environment should increase the likelihood of adherence. Clinicians can also check adherence to medication regimens by requesting patients to bring in their pill bottles (or other prescription containers) for a discussion on how the medication appears to be working for them. This should elicit information from the patient about problems related to medication adherence. Since patient variables and social support affect adherence behaviors, eliciting information from patients about their understanding and beliefs regarding their particular illness and treatment, as well as enlisting the support of family and friends, may encourage adherence. Identifying what individual patients perceive as obstacles in following treatment regimens decreases their likelihood of nonadherence; these are difficulties that can be negotiated during the medical interview. Individualizing the treatment and minimizing its complexity may provide the solution that encourages adherent behavior. Frequent reeducation, reinforcement, and encouragement, as well as training in self-management and self-monitoring, will at the very least maximize the patient's comprehension of the illness and his or her motivation for adherence--an especially important requisite for living with a chronic condition. Some patients may even wish to openly solicit family and friends for help in the management and monitoring of their illness and treatment, and to structure their environment to support adherence. Education programs for the patient featuring handouts and pamphlets that provide information about the illness in written and illustrated form have been used successfully. Education programs such as patient-oriented package inserts to accompany the medications and brief written summaries of complex treatment plans may also be useful. The purpose of such patient education adjuncts to illness and treatment lie in the hope that they will enhance the likelihood of following treatment recommendations. Through their use, the reason for the treatment and its potential effectiveness will, it is hoped, be better understood (Ley 1988). Overall, significant advances have been made in adherence research. Measurement systems have become more finely tuned, and the definitions and criteria for adherent behaviors are more clear and precise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNoncompliance with medications is one of the most serious problems facing health care today. However, methods to measure compliance have many limitations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo measure specific drug compliance and dosing frequency of two asthma medications, we used medical records data and pharmacy claims data from 276 patients who had concurrent prescriptions for inhaled anti-inflammatory agents and oral theophylline. Patients were randomly selected from the pharmacy claims data files of a health maintenance organization. The patients' medical records were reviewed, and records that did not contain clear documentation of the medication, dose, and dosing frequency were excluded. Data from the remaining 119 medical records were compared with data from pharmacy claims to calculate compliance rates for each medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur calculations showed that patients were significantly more compliant with prescribed theophylline medication than with two inhaled anti-inflammatory medications (P = .0001). No significant differences in compliance were found relative to prescribed dosing frequency (twice daily or less compared with three times daily or more) for either medication (P = .6517).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nComparison of medical record data with pharmacy claims data is an effective indirect measure of patients' compliance with prescribed oral theophylline and inhaled anti-inflammatory agents. Additional interventions must be pursued for patients with asthma regarding adherence to regimens for their prescribed inhaled anti-inflammatory agents.",

Prescription rates for inhaled steroids and inhaled bronchodilators declined, but rates for oral bronchodilators (beta-agonists and theophylline) increased. By stepwise multiple regression, higher bronchodilator-inhaled steroid prescription ratios and lower inhaled steroid prescription rates were each significantly associated with ZIP codes in which greater proportions of residents lacked a high school diploma (P < .001); associations that approached statistical significance were found for higher bronchodilator-inhaled steroid ratios and fewer asthma care providers (P = .05) and for lower inhaled steroid prescription rates and lower proportions of asthma specialists (P = .04).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn Philadelphia, a gap exists between optimal asthma drug prescribing and actual prescribing patterns that has widened from July 1991 to June 1993. Underuse of inhaled steroids is most closely associated with lower educational attainment, suggesting that interventions that include addressing the special asthma care needs of a low-literacy population will be required to achieve the goals of the National Asthma Education Program.",

This problem is compounded when English is the patient's second language. A process for improving patient education materials (PEMs) through adaptation or creation of new materials to meet the health needs of diverse groups is presented.1 The process was applied to a popular health education program used with school-age children and their parents to teach them home management of asthma. Target parents were known to read at a 5th-grade level, and English was a second language for many of them. Therefore, extensive revision of the existing PEMs was required. The steps to successful revision included assessing readability and comprehensibility, editing the materials, and evaluating the new PEMs to determine the effectiveness of the revision measures.",

        "abstract": "Purpose. Successful control of asthma relies heavily on patient adherence to prescribed inhalation therapies. Many patients are unable to use inhalers correctly and, therefore, do not reap the full therapeutic benefits. The purpose of this study was to assess the readability and related characteristics of Consumer Medication Information (CMI) for all prescription asthma inhalation devices currently available in the United States. Methods. We identified all brand-name (n = 18) and generic (n = 2) asthma inhalation devices currently available in the United States. English language CMI was obtained from pharmaceutical manufacturers of each identified product. The CMI from these products was evaluated for readability characteristics, including reading grade level using the Fry formula, text point size, dimensions (length and width), diagrams, and directions. Results. The mean Fry readability of the CMI was at grade level 8.2 \u00b1 1.5 (range = 5\u201311), while the average text point size was 9.2 \u00b1 2.2 (range = 6\u201312). The mean length of the pages on which the CMI was printed was 33.7 \u00b1 21.5 cm, while the average width of pages was 12.9 \u00b1 9.5 cm.

        "abstract": "Background: There has been an increasing drive from consumers for more information to be available about their medicines. However, the layout and presentation of such written information is variable, and the poor format and design discourages people from reading the documents. Objective: To identify, collate, and evaluate different formats of written medicine information (WMI). Methods: Three researchers evaluated 157 samples of WMI for 10 prescription and 3 over-the-counter medicines from 6 English-speaking countries compared with the United States Keystone Consensus Criterion 8 (USKCC8) and the Ten Key Principles (TKP) of Consumer Medicine Information. Readability was measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Fog tests. Compliance (%) with the criteria was computed and examined using the median test. Results: Overall median compliance with USKCC8 was 70%, and 74% to TKP. New Zealand leaflets achieved the highest compliance with USKCC8 (83%, Interquartile range (IQR) 70\u201389%), with US leaflets the lowest (55%. IQR 45\u201370%). Australian and New Zealand leaflets showed the highest compliance with TKP (90%, IQR 80\u2013100% and 87\u201397%, respectively), while UK leaflets demonstrated the lowest (60%, IQR 52\u201371%). Overall median reading grades for the leaflets were 10 (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) and 11 (Fog). Conclusions: Compliance with USKCC8 and TKP varied greatly between countries, with readability grades exceeding the recommended range. International examples of WMI show wide variation in compliance with guidelines on recommended format and presentation. These examples of WMI require high literacy to read. Future WMI development should use more recommended formats and increase comprehensibility.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis study aimed to assess the knowledge, beliefs and behaviours of an Omani population with regards to the adverse effects of medicines.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and June 2012. A 17-item questionnaire was designed to assess three aspects: knowledge, beliefs and behaviours related to medicine safety. A total of 740 questionnaires were distributed in three representative governorates of Oman. Median total scores for the three sections were estimated. Associations with participants' demographic variables and medication histories were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 618 participants completed the survey (response rate: 83.5%). Many participants (46.4%) believed that side-effects occurred only with high doses of medication and over 30% believed that they did not occur at all with traditional and over-the-counter medicines. The median total score was 19 (interquartile range: 6) out of a maximum of 30. Inadequate knowledge, incorrect beliefs and good behaviours were observed among the participants. There was a significant association between certain demographic parameters (age, educational qualification, history of chronic use of medicines and employment status) and median total scores. Participants reported obtaining additional information on medication safety from various sources, with doctors as the most widely used source.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInadequate knowledge and incorrect beliefs among this Omani population indicate a need for interventions to improve public knowledge and address misconceptions regarding medication safety. These interventions could be initiated on both an individual and public scale, with patient interactions by healthcare professionals and mass education activities targeting the larger population.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To assess the level of knowledge of the adult users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regarding their side effects and the socio-demographic factors associated with the use of these drugs in the adult population of Albania. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including a representative sample of 199 individuals aged \u226518 years (77% women; overall mean age: 30.3\u00b110.0 years; overall response rate: 90%) who were users of NSAIDs recruited in ten different pharmacies in Tirana municipality during April-May 2015. A self-administered questionnaire contained basic socio-demographic information and questions about NSAIDs use, their types, participants\u2019 knowledge about NSAIDs side effects and their interaction with other drugs. Results: In 56% of the cases, NSAIDs were taken by participants\u2019 own decisions, whereas in about 29% of the cases these drugs were prescribed by physicians. Acetaminophen, ketoprofen and ibuprofen were the most frequently used NSAIDs. Overall, 51% of participants thought NSAIDs could cause allergic reactions, whereas one third or fewer were aware of each of the following side effects: upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, gastritis, kidney failure, myopathy, osteoporosis. About one third of participants were aware of NSAIDs-other drug interactions, whereas some of them were already taking contraindicated drugs. No significant differences were noticed regarding sex, age, educational level, employment status and marital status, with very few exceptions. Conclusion: Our findings indicate limited knowledge about NSAIDs side effects and their interaction with other drugs among the Albania adult population, which is a cause of concern.",

        "title": "Knowledge of patients on safe medication use in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed and used medications that are used as analgesic, antipyretic, or anti-inflammatory agents, but have a high risk of adverse effects. Objective: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the knowledge of patients toward the risks and safe usage of NSAIDs. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who attended orthopedic clinics at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during December 2017 to February 2018. A self-administered questionnaire comprising three sections [sociodemographic information, patients' knowledge of NSAIDs, and the attitude toward receiving information about NSAIDs' adverse drug reactions (ADRs)] was used. The attitude was measured with a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The mean duration of NSAIDs usage was 7.3 \u00b1 6.9 years. Only 45% of the respondents used NSAIDs daily, while 38% said they only used NSAIDs as needed. Nearly one-quarter of patients (25.5%) were counseled by a healthcare provider on the risks of NSAIDs. Almost 94% and 90.5% of the study subjects agreed that physicians and pharmacists, respectively, should play an essential role in providing information regarding ADRs to their patients. More than half of the respondents claimed that information about ADRs might lead them to discontinue their medicines. More than one-third of respondents stated that their healthcare setting provided them with insufficient knowledge of ADRs. Conclusion: Counseling of patients may diminish potentially inappropriate use and increase risk awareness. Healthcare providers can improve their role in identifying and counseling patients on NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To assess community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and practices regarding screening risk factors and providing safety information about the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to patients. Methods: Cross-sectional and a self-administered questionnaire-based study was conducted over a 4-month period (May-August 2019) with selected community pharmacies in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire composed of demographic data and the pharmacist\u2019s role in supplying NSAIDs. Results: The majority of participating community pharmacists dispense NSAIDs. However, many did not apply relevantly good communication skills such as seeking information about concomitant drugs (42.5%) or providing advice on managing any adverse side effects of taking NSAIDs (39.1%). Most of the community pharmacists also did not provide relevantly good communication about risk factors. The most common screening risk factors mentioned were a history of pregnancy and breastfeeding (84.2%) followed by being at an older age (74.5%) or a history of a gastrointestinal ulcer (71.5%). Conclusion: Community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia need to appropriately screen their patients for adverse drug reactions and effectively communicate the risks of using NSAIDs. The Saudi Regulatory Authority could endorse several approaches to apply a good strategy for improving the dispensing practices in community pharmacies, communication and awareness of risk factors especially in high-risk patients who are taking NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Background Pain is a global health issue that affects an individual\u2019s quality of life. Its alleviation and management will enhance patients\u2019 experience. Community pharmacists can help manage pain severity through their valuable roles in medical teams and by managing the consequences of pain. Objective This study aimed to evaluate community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and attitudes toward pain and pain management in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and attitudes toward pain and pain management in Saudi Arabia. Pharmacists aged \u2265 21 years, with a degree in pharmacy were included in this study. Each respondent participated in an online survey covering cancer-oriented pain and assessment of pain; pharmacology; abuse of substances; and physical dependence. An independent t-test and One-way ANOVA, with least significant difference as a post-hoc test, were employed, in addition to the General Linear Regression Model using Main Effect as the model. Results This study revealed that the pain-related knowledge and attitude among community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia were inadequate. Age (p = 0.003), work experience (p = 0.036), nature of work (p = 0.001), and work location (p = 0.003) were determined as significant factors affecting their overall knowledge and attitude toward pain. Conclusion Overall, attempts to expand community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and foster an appropriate attitude toward pain management among them in Saudi Arabia are highly recommended. Additional academic courses, studies, and tailored neuroscience courses will improve their awareness and knowledge of pain and pain management.",

        "abstract": "Background: Analgesics are frequently used to manage pain, and community pharmacists play a crucial role in prescribing these medications. However, inappropriate prescribing patterns and inadequate pharmacological knowledge of analgesics among pharmacists can lead to adverse health outcomes and increase healthcare costs. Aim: Eevaluating the prescribing patterns and pharmacological knowledge of analgesics among community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia. The study also seeks to identify any potential areas of deficiency in the knowledge or practices of community pharmacists regarding the safe and effective use of analgesics. Ultimately, to enhance the quality of care provided to patients who require analgesic therapy, by addressing any gaps in the knowledge or practices of community pharmacists. Method: In November 2022, a study was conducted in Jeddah to investigate the prescribing skills and level of pharmacological knowledge of analgesics among community pharmacists. The research design used for this study was cross-sectional. Results: One hundred thirty fours community pharmacists responded to the survey. Most participants were male, 31 years old or above, with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Pharmacy. Most of the community pharmacists were aware of the correct use, side effects or complications, contraindications, safe dosage, and reaction mechanism of analgesics. The community pharmacists obtained a favorable mean knowledge score (> 50%) of analgesic drugs. Conclusion: Community pharmacists reported correct prescribing patterns and adequate pharmacological knowledge. However, when pharmacists have little community experience their analgesic drug knowledge tends to be weaker, but it becomes stronger after 5 years.",
