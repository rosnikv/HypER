        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nComparing the antidepressant effects of Citalopram with Fluoxetine and their effect on glycemic control in diabetic patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty patients attending the Diabetes Research Center in Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran from September 2006 to October 2007 with type II diabetes and suffering from major depression were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n=20 per group) in a randomized controlled trial method. They received up to 40 mg/d of Fluoxetine or Citalopram. Twelve weeks after treatment, patients were reassessed in terms of severity of depression and diabetic status. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and psychiatric interview were used to measure the severity of depression and follow up the patients. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and fasting blood sugar (FBS) was obtained to monitor glycemic control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter the 12-week treatment, both groups showed significant improvement in severity of depression, FBS, and HbA1c. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of improvement in depression and diabetic status.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFluoxetine and Citalopram can effectively reduce the severity of depression in diabetic patients without an adverse effect on glycemic control.",

        "title": "Citalopram versus other anti-depressive agents for depression.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRecent US and UK clinical practice guidelines recommend that second-generation antidepressants should be considered amongst the best first-line options when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Systematic reviews have already highlighted some differences in efficacy between second-generation antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) introduced in the market, is one of these antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with tricyclics, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and other conventional and non-conventional antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to February 2012. No language restriction was applied. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field for supplemental data.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to citalopram versus any other antidepressants.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), patient acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThirty-seven trials compared citalopram with other antidepressants (such as tricyclics, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other antidepressants, either conventional ones, such as mirtazapine, venlafaxine and reboxetine, or non-conventional, like hypericum). Citalopram was shown to be significantly less effective than escitalopram in achieving acute response (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.02), but more effective than paroxetine (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.96) and reboxetine (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91). Significantly fewer patients allocated to citalopram withdrew from trials due to adverse events compared with patients allocated to tricyclics (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and fewer patients allocated to citalopram reported at least one side effect than reboxetine or venlafaxine (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97 and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88, respectively).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nSome statistically significant differences between citalopram and other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. Citalopram was more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine and venlafaxine, however, it seemed to be less efficacious than escitalopram. As with most systematic reviews in psychopharmacology, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings. Economic analyses were not reported in the included studies, however, cost effectiveness information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials.",

        "title": "Hypothalamus-Anchored Resting Brain Network Changes before and after Sertraline Treatment in Major Depression",
        "abstract": "Sertraline, one of the oldest antidepressants, remains to be the most efficacious treatment for depression. However, major depression disorder (MDD) is characterized by altered emotion processing and deficits in cognitive control. In cognitive interference tasks, patients with MDD have shown excessive hypothalamus activity. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of antidepressant treatment (sertraline) on hypothalamus-anchored resting brain circuitry. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on depressed patients (n=12) both before and after antidepressant treatment. After eight weeks of antidepressant treatment, patients with depression showed significantly increased connectivity between the hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, putamen, caudate, and claustrum. By contrast, decreased connectivity of the hypothalamus-related areas was primarily located in the inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, cingulated gyrus, precuneus, thalamus, and cerebellum. After eight weeks of antidepressant therapy, 8 out of the 12 depressed subjects achieved 70% reduction or better in depressive symptoms, as measured on the Hamilton depression rating scale. Our findings may infer that antidepressant treatment can alter the functional connectivity of the hypothalamus resting brain to achieve its therapeutic effect.",

        "title": "Neural Correlates of Antidepressant Treatment Response in Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe neural changes underlying response to antidepressant treatment in adolescents are unknown. Identification of neural change correlates of treatment response could (1) aid in understanding mechanisms of depression and its treatment and (2) serve as target biomarkers for future research.\n\n\nMETHOD\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined changes in brain activation and functional connectivity in 13 unmedicated adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after receiving treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication for 8 weeks. Specifically, we examined brain activation during a negative emotion task and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), focusing on the amygdala to capture networks relevant to negative emotion. We conducted whole-brain analyses to identify how symptom improvement was related to change in brain activation during a negative emotion task or amygdala RSFC.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter treatment, clinical improvement was associated with decreased task activation in rostral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and increased activation in bilateral insula, bilateral middle frontal cortices, right parahippocampus, and left cerebellum. Analysis of change in amygdala RSFC showed that treatment response was associated with increased amygdala RSFC with right frontal cortex, but decreased amygdala RSFC with right precuneus and right posterior cingulate cortex.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings represent a foothold for advancing understanding of pathophysiology of MDD in adolescents by revealing the critical neural circuitry changes that underlie a positive response to a standard treatment. Although preliminary, the present study provides a research platform for future work needed to confirm these biomarkers at a larger scale before using them in future target engagement studies of novel treatments.",

However, the neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A cortico\u2010limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is modulated by serotonin (5\u2010HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) challenges 5\u2010HT regulation and may identify vulnerable neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene\u2013environment interaction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Despite aggression being detrimental to children\u2019s physical health, mental health and social development, the dispositional and neurological antecedents of aggression in the child are poorly understood. Here we examined the relationship between trait aggression as measured by Buss and Warren\u2019s Aggression Questionnaire and personality traits measured with Big Five Questionnaire for Children in 77 primary-school children and recorded resting-state brain activity (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations [fALFF]) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The present results showed that trait aggression was negatively correlated with agreeableness and positively correlated with neuroticism. The brain analyses showed that children with a higher propensity for aggression had a lower fALFF mainly in the left superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus. Physical and total aggressions were negatively associated with rsFC between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right putamen. Further analysis revealed that this rsFC could moderate the influence of neuroticism on total aggression. Moreover, the results suggest the presence of a sex difference in the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying aggression in middle childhood. Overall, our findings indicate that aggressive children have lower agreeableness and higher neuroticism, and the underlying neural systems are mainly implicated in social judgment and empathy.",

However, it is unclear about whether similar connection exist in early age. This study investigated how personality traits and family environment influence the development of aggression in school aged Saudi children. A sample of 315 school going children were recruited voluntarily to complete a set of measures examining Big Five personality factors, family environment and aggression. Correlation analysis were employed to evaluate association between Big Five personality traits, family environment and aggression. The results showed a significant relationship of Big Five personality factors and family environment factors to aggression. The findings of the study revealed that amongst the Big Five personality traits conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism were strongest antecedents of childhood aggression. Family environment characterized by family cohesion, expressiveness and conflict were appeared to be significant antecedents of aggressive behavior in children. This study expands our knowledge about the intervention strategies of aggression from Big Five traits and family environment perspectives.",

        "abstract": "The study aimed to identify the impact of personality types on aggressive behavior among juvenile delinquents in shelters, and determine if there are differences attributable to the variables of gender and educational level. To achieve the objectives of the study, a questionnaire was constructed consisting of three parts; the first part included personal information about the respondents; the second was related to personality types (introversion, emotionality, extraversion) and contained (15) items; the third was related to aggressive behavior (against oneself, others, and objects) and contained (27) items. The study sample was selected using the comprehensive listing, which consisted of (150) juvenile delinquents who were kept in both the Osama bin Zeid Shelter and the Shelter of education and rehabilitation for Girls / Al-Rusaifah. \u00a0The results showed that the arithmetic means of the personality types characteristic of juvenile delinquents ranged between (2.38-3.79), where the extroversion type came first, followed by the emotionality type, while the introversion pattern came last. As for the aggressive behavior patterns of juveniles, the results showed that the domain of aggressive behavior against others came first, followed by aggressive behavior against objects, while the domain of aggressive behavior against oneself came last.\u00a0The results also showed that there are no statistically significant differences that are attributed to the variables of the gender and educational level of the sample members in all personality types, as the results showed that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between extroversion and aggressive behavior against oneself, as well as introversion and aggressive behavior against others. However, there is a positive relationship between extroversion and aggressive behavior against others, introversion and aggressive behavior against oneself, emotionality and aggressive behavior against others and against objects.",
