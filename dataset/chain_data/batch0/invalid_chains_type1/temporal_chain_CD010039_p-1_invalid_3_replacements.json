        "title": "Effects of skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract on frequency of gout flares: a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives Previous laboratory studies have identified two dairy fractions, glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract (G600), with anti-inflammatory effects in models of acute gout. The aim of this proof-of-concept clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that daily intake of skim milk powder (SMP) enriched with GMP and G600 can prevent gout flares. Methods This was a 3-month randomised double-blind controlled trial of milk products for prevention of gout flares. One hundred and twenty patients with recurrent gout flares were randomised to one of three arms: lactose powder control, SMP control and SMP enriched with GMP and G600 (SMP/GMP/G600). The primary end point was change in the frequency of gout flares using a daily flare diary measured monthly for 3 months. Results The frequency of gout flares reduced in all three groups over the 3-month study period compared with baseline. Over the 3-month study period there was a significantly greater reduction in gout flares in the SMP/GMP/G600 group (analysis of covariance pgroup=0.031, Tukey post hoc test compared with lactose control, p=0.044). Following treatment with SMP/GMP/G600 over the 3-month period, greater improvements were also observed in pain and fractional excretion of uric acid, with trends to greater improvement in tender joint count. Similar adverse event rates and discontinuation rates were observed between the three groups. Conclusions This is the first reported controlled trial of dietary intervention in patients with gout, and suggests that SMP enriched with GMP and G600 may reduce the frequency of gout flares.",

        "title": "2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout",
        "abstract": "Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6\u2005mg/dL (360\u2005\u00b5mol/L) and <5\u2005mg/dL (300\u2005\u00b5mol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended. Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

        "title": "New Perspectives in Rheumatology: Implications of the Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities Trial and the Associated Food and Drug Administration Public Safety Alert",
        "abstract": "Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now\u2010published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all\u2010cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate\u2010lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long\u2010term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first\u2010line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first\u2010line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision\u2010making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

        "title": "Rheumatologists\u2019 understanding of refractory gout: a questionnaire survey in China",
        "abstract": "Objective To explore the understanding of refractory gout in Chinese rheumatologists. Methods We conducted an anonymous survey of rheumatologists attending an annual national academic conference on rheumatism. Results Of the 910 rheumatologists who completed the questionnaire, 751 (82.5%) had received relevant continuing medical education (CME). Of these, 140 (18.6%) rheumatologists did not select xanthine oxidase inhibitors as the first treatment for patients with chronic tophaceous gout. Of all respondents, 113 (12.4%), 251 (27.6%) and 324 (35.6%) prescribed incorrect maximum doses of allopurinol, febuxostat and benzbromarone, respectively; this tendency was more pronounced in the non-CME group. Most rheumatologists agreed that complications and comorbidities increased the difficulty of gout management and considered the term refractory gout to describe those cases with uncontrolled symptoms, unmet treatment targets or non-shrinkage of tophi after standardized drug treatment. Moreover, 62.8% (472/751) of specialists considered that a diagnosis of refractory gout was appropriate for patients whose lifestyle and compliance failed to improve despite adequate education and regular urate-lowering therapy. Conclusions Incorrect and inadequate drug therapy may contribute to some cases of refractory gout, especially in physicians without CME. An emphasis on non-drug therapy and the management of comorbidities and complications may reduce cases of refractory gout.",

        "title": "Association Between Uric Acid and Worsening Peripheral Microangiopathy in Systemic Sclerosis",
        "abstract": "Objective: The key element in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is microcirculatory changes in several vascular beds. Uric acid is associated with endothelial dysfunction and therefore, microvascular damage. The aim of this study was to examine the association between uric acid (UA) and peripheral microvascular involvement in patients with SSc. Methods: We included consecutive, consenting patients with SSc. Serum UA, urea and creatinine were measured, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated with CKD-EPI. All participants underwent nailfold video-capillaroscopy (NVC) to evaluate the microcirculation. Results: A total of 64 patients (95.3% women) were included in the study. UA levels were significantly associated with the number of avascular areas (r = 0.290; p = 0.020), whereas no correlation was shown for the GFR (r = \u22120.065; p = 0.609). A significant trend of UA in the three capillaroscopic patterns was shown (3.90 \u00b1 1.52 vs. 4.15 \u00b1 0.98 vs. 5.38 \u00b1 2.26; for early, active, and late patterns respectively, p = 0.028). Multivariate analysis showed that male gender (\u03b2 = 3.049; 95% CI = 0.997\u20135.101) and UA (\u03b2 = 0.352; 95% CI = 0.117\u20130.588) were independently associated with the number of avascular areas. Conclusion: These data suggest that UA levels are significantly associated with the capillaroscopic patterns, reflecting a progressive microvasculopathy.",

        "title": "Nailfold Videocapillaroscopy for the Evaluation of Peripheral Microangiopathy in Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and refractory autoimmune joint disease that affects multiple organs. Several methods have been applied for the study of microvascular endothelial dysfunction, which is considered an important component of vascular disease in RA. Implementation of nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) represents a viable choice, as the skin is an easily accessible window for the non-invasive, real-time assessment of subtle microcirculation abnormalities. Although NVC is routinely used in the rheumatology field, especially for the diagnostic workout of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, accumulating evidence suggests a role in the evaluation of systemic vasculopathy associated with autoimmune rheumatic disorders. The current paper aims to provide an overview of NVC as a valuable clinical aid for the assessment of peripheral microcirculation in RA. Previous studies characterizing the capillaroscopic pattern in RA are summarized, along with associations with disease-related characteristics. Most available reports have mainly focused on the descriptions of non-specific morphological alterations that may reflect endothelial injury over the course of the disease. Still, the exact pattern of structural and functional capillaroscopic alterations and their clinical significance in RA remains a subject of ongoing research.",

        "abstract": "Aims This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between serum uric acid levels and the efficacy of uric acid-lowering therapies on clinical outcomes among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted through October 21, 2023, across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The pooled effect sizes were estimated and presented with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on various factors, including sample size (<1,000 vs. \u22651,000), follow-up duration (<2 years vs. \u22652 years), study quality (assessed by a score of <7 vs. \u22657), ethnicity (Non-Asian vs. Asian), study design (prospective vs. retrospective), type of heart failure (HF) (acute vs. chronic), presence of hyperuricemia (yes or no), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds (\u226545% vs. \u226550%), and the type of uric acid-lowering therapy (traditional vs. novel). Results The analysis included a total of 12 studies. Elevated serum uric acid levels were significantly linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality [relative risk (RR): 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06\u20131.37, P\u2009=\u20090.004] and cardiovascular (CV) mortality (RR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.42\u20132.04, P\u2009<\u20090.001) in HFpEF patients. Subgroup analyses confirmed this association, particularly in non-Asian populations, those with chronic HFpEF, and studies with a follow-up duration of two years or more. Additionally, higher uric acid levels were associated with an increased risk of HF-related hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR): 1.61, 95% CI: 1.12\u20132.34, P\u2009=\u20090.011]. Regarding treatment, uric acid-lowering therapy did not show a significant effect on reducing mortality in HFpEF patients. However, it was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization due to HF (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79\u20130.91, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the prognostic significance of serum uric acid levels in HFpEF and suggest that uric acid-lowering therapy may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of HF hospitalizations. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which uric acid-lowering therapy confers its potential benefits.",
