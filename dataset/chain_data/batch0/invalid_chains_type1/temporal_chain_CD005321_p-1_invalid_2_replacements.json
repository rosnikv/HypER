        "title": "[Mechanism of action of hyaluronic acid in gonarthrosis of both knee joints in a right/left comparison. Study with dynamometry, oxygen partial pressure, temperature and Lequesne score].",
        "abstract": "In a controlled prospective randomized study we evaluated the effectiveness of intraarticular injected hyaluronic acid regarding the changes in the parameters dynamometry, synovial oxygen partial pressure, intraarticular temperature and the knee joint function (Lequesne score). We examined 18 patients with osteoarthritis in both knee joints (Kellgren classification II or III according to x-ray) in right/left comparison. The evaluated parameters were measured before and after a 5-week treatment phase with 5 intraarticular injections (one injection per week). With regard to the efficacy results changes in dynamometric measurement for flexion and extension (for all angular velocities) and Lequesne-score indicate a marked improvement after treatment with hyaluronic acid. The differences between treated and untreated knee were significant. In extension the p-value was 0.0008 and in flexion p = 0.0015. The p-value of the Lequesne-index between the verum and control group was p = 0.0002. After treatment values for oxygen pressure were higher than at baseline and for the intraarticular temperature a small decrease at the end of the treatment phase was documented. The intraarticular injection of hyaluronic acid is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with gonarthrosis. The treatment resulted in a functional improvement of the knee joint and had a good pain-lowering effect in patients suffering from gonarthrosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is an incurable joint disorder, representing a major public health issue. Among options for symptom control, viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid (HA) had established usefulness in pain and function improvement of the knee. However, it is not clear which form of HA yields better results.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nWe compared two HA preparations with high (HMW) or low molecular weight (LMW) in terms of pain control and function improvement using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the visual analog scale (VAS) score in patients with knee OA. During 2013, 80 patients were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, randomized study. Each patient received a weekly injection of either preparation with a total of five injections for the LMW group and three for the HMW group. They were evaluated at baseline, five weeks, three months and one year after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both groups, HA treatment resulted in significant improvement in pain and function that begun immediately after treatment and lasted for one year. However when compared with each other, HMW and LMW groups were comparable in mean WOMAC, and VAS score at each time point. Neither preparation can interrupt disease progression as radiological findings remained constant during follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntra-articular injections using HMW or LMW HA can improve stiffness, joint function and pain in patients suffering from knee OA. However, no clear benefit seems to exist between the two preparations and neither can slow disease progression. Hippokratia 2016, 20(1): 26-31.",

        "abstract": "This review shows the steps toward material selection focalized on the design and development of medical devices based on hyaluronan (HA). The selection is based on chemical and mechanical properties, biocompatibility, sterilization, safety, and scale-up costs. These facts play a vital role in the industrialization process. Approved medical devices containing-HA are illustrated to identify key parameters. The first part of this work involves the steps toward a complete characterization of chemical and mechanical aspects, reproducibility of the processes and scale up. In a second stage, we aimed to describe the preclinical in vitro and in vivo assays and selected examples of clinical trials. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind the regulatory affairs during the research and development (R&D) using standardization (ISO standards) to achieve the main goal, which is the functionality and safety of the final device. To keep reproducible experimental data to prepare an efficient master file for the device, based on quality and recorded manufacturing data, and a rigorous R&D process may help toward clinical translation. A strong debate is still going on because the denominated basic research in HA field does not pay attention to the purity and quality of the raw materials used during the development. So that, to achieve the next generation of devices is needed to overcome the limitations of state of art in terms of efficacy, biodegradability, and non-toxicity.",

        "title": "The efficacy and safety of polydeoxyribonucleotide for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: The purpose of this study was to use meta-analysis techniques to evaluate the efficacy and safety of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) injections for knee osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Methods: Multiple comprehensive databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, were searched in November 2018 for studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of intra-articular PDRN injection for the knee joint with hyaluronic acid (HA) injection. Two reviewers independently determined study inclusion and they extracted data using a standardized data extraction form. The predefined primary outcome was Visual Analogue Scale. Secondary outcomes included Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS), and adverse events. Results: Five randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. After 1 and 2 months, patients in the PDRN group showed significantly better improvement in pain than the HA group (P\u200a=\u200a.04 and P\u200a=\u200a.02, respectively). There was no significant difference in pain after 4 months. The pooled analysis showed that no significant differences were seen in function (KOOS and KSS) scores between the PDRN and HA groups (all P\u200a>\u200a.05) at all time points. There was no significant difference in adverse events between 2 groups (relative risks = 2.15, 95% confidential interval: 0.17\u201326.67, P\u200a=\u200a.55). Conclusion: The intra-articular use of PDRN was similar in function to HA, and the pain-relief effect was superior to HA for 2 months post-injection. Therefore, it could be a favorable alternative to HA to treat persistent pain associated with knee OA while avoiding side effects. Level of evidence I",

        "abstract": "Polynucleotides (PN) have long been known as an effective supportive therapy for wound healing. The present study investigated whether a hydrogel formulation containing PN and hyaluronic acid (PN + HA) could promote wound healing in an in vitro model of gingival fibroblasts. PN promoted cell growth and viability as assessed by different assays, and PN + HA, though not significantly further increasing cell growth as compared to PN, supported the formation of dense multilayered cell nodules. PN promoted fibroblasts\u2019 clonogenic efficiency and PN + HA further enhanced the formation of more numerous dense colonies. PN + HA appeared to significantly increase the expression of collagen 1a1 and 3a1, while not affecting proteoglycans deposition. Interestingly, when tested in a scratch assay, PN + HA achieved gap closure after 48 h, while cells in the comparison groups had not completely bridged the scratch even after 96 h. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PN + HA is a promising candidate for a supportive therapy to promote soft tissue healing in the oral cavity.",

        "abstract": "(1) Background: Three-dimensional cultures are useful tools to evaluate regenerative approaches in vitro, as they may mimic the spatial arrangement of cells more closely to natural tissues than routine 2D culture methods. (2) Methods: We investigated the effects of a polynucleotide, hyaluronic acid (PN, HA) compound on 3D spheroid cultures of primary gingival fibroblasts, by measuring their morphology over time, cell viability with Calcein-AM, a fluorescent marker, and cell growth potential by re-plating spheroids in attachment-permissive regular culture plates under routine conditions and following them up for 15 days. (3) Results: PN + HA induced an increase in spheroid size and perimeter and a decrease in spheroid circularity, as cells tended to grow and form small peripheral stacks around the spheroid. Levels of cell viability were also higher in this group. After re-plating, only the spheroids previously stimulated with PN + HA dissolved completely during the second week of culture and colonized the plate, thus indicating the retention of a higher level of viability by the cells forming the whole spheroid with this stimulus. (4) Conclusions: Taken together, our data support the idea that the combination of PN and HA has synergic effects on primary fibroblasts and promotes their viability, the growth of 3D cellular constructs, and the retention of a remarkable proliferative potential over the course of the experimental period, making it a promising compound for further investigations.",
