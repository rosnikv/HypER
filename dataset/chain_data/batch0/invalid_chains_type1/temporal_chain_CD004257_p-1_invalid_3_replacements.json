        "abstract": "Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, and placebo were compared to determine their efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis of the knee. In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose, parallel-design studies, patients with osteoarthritis aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 60.6 \u00b1 12.8 years were randomized to daily doses of 660 mg naproxen sodium (440 mg naproxen sodium in patients \u226565 years), 4000 mg acetaminophen, or placebo for 7 days. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in pain at rest, on passive motion, on weight-bearing, stiffness after rest (morning), day and night pain compared with placebo, and significantly greater relief from resting pain than acetaminophen (P < 0.05). Acetaminophen provided significantly greater improvements in day pain compared with placebo. Daily evaluations showed naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided superior pain relief to acetaminophen and was significantly better than acetaminophen at reducing difficulties experienced in walking several blocks and difficulties in bending, lifting, and stooping. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) and acetaminophen (4000 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mobility level, household tasks, and walking and bending. Patient and investigator evaluation scores were significantly higher in naproxen sodium and acetaminophen groups compared with placebo; no differences were observed between active treatments. Naproxen sodium and acetaminophen had similar safety profiles to placebo. Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) effectively relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis. Naproxen sodium is an alternative in the initial treatment of osteoarthritis and may be preferred to acetaminophen as first-line therapy in patients with moderate or severe pain.",

While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.",

Objective: Characterize ASS in APAP hepatotoxicity. Methods: ASS was measured in plasma from rodents and humans with APAP hepatotoxicity. Results: In mice, ASS increased before injury, peaked before alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased rapidly. Fischer rats had a greater increase in ASS relative to ALT. Patients with abnormal liver test results had very high ASS compared to controls. ASS appeared to increase early in some patients, and declined rapidly in all.

        "title": "Acetaminophen: Dose-Dependent Drug Hepatotoxicity and Acute Liver Failure in Patients",
        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced liver injury is a rare but serious clinical problem. A number of drugs can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure at therapeutic doses in a very limited number of patients (<1:10,000). This idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, which is currently not predictable in preclinical safety studies, appears to depend on individual susceptibility and the inability to adapt to the cellular stress caused by a particular drug. In striking contrast to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, drugs with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity are mostly detected during preclinical studies and do not reach the market. One notable exception is acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol), which is a safe drug at therapeutic doses but can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure after intentional and unintentional overdoses. Key Messages: APAP overdose is responsible for more acute liver failure cases in the USA or UK than all other etiologies combined. Since APAP overdose in the mouse represents a model for the human pathophysiology, substantial progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of cell death, liver injury and recovery. More recently, emerging evidence based on mechanistic biomarker analysis in patients and studies of cell death in human hepatocytes suggests that most of the mechanisms discovered in mice also apply to patients. The rapid development of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote against APAP overdose was based on the early understanding of APAP toxicity in mice. However, despite the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in patients who present early after APAP overdose, there is a need to develop intervention strategies for late-presenting patients. Conclusions: The challenges related to APAP toxicity are to better understand the mechanisms of cell death in order to limit liver injury and prevent acute liver failure, and also to develop biomarkers that better predict as early as possible who is at risk for developing acute liver failure with poor outcome.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs were discovered more than 2 decades ago and have profound impact on diverse biological processes. Specific microRNAs have important roles in modulating the innate immune response and their dysregulation has been demonstrated to contribute to inflammatory diseases. MiR\u2010223 in particular, is very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It functions as key modulator for the differentiation and activation of myeloid cells. The central role of miR\u2010223 in myeloid cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage differentiation and activation has been studied extensively. MiR\u2010223 contributes to myeloid differentiation by enhancing granulopoiesis while inhibiting macrophage differentiation. Uncontrolled myeloid activation has detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. MiR\u2010223 serves as a negative feedback mechanism controlling excessive innate immune responses in the maintenance of myeloid cell homeostasis. This review summarizes several topics covering the function of miR\u2010223 in myeloid differentiation, neutrophil and macrophage functions, as well as in inflammatory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, nonmyeloid functions of miR\u2010223 are also discussed in this review. Therapeutic enhancement of miR\u2010223 to dampen inflammatory targets is also highlighted as potential treatment to control excessive innate immune responses during mucosal inflammation.",

        "abstract": "The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against invading microorganisms. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) are the most abundant leukocyte in humans and essential to the innate immune response against invading pathogens. Compared to the acquired immune response, which requires time to develop and is dependent on previous interaction with specific microbes, the ability of neutrophils to kill microorganisms is immediate, nonspecific, and not dependent on previous exposure to microorganisms. Historically, studies of PMN\u2010pathogen interaction focused on the events leading to killing of microorganisms, such as recruitment/chemotaxis, transmigration, phagocytosis, and activation, whereas postphagocytosis sequelae were infrequently considered. In addition, it was widely accepted that human neutrophils possessed limited capacity for new gene transcription and thus, relatively little biosynthetic capacity. This notion has changed dramatically within the past 20\u2009years. Further, there is now more effort directed to understand the events occurring in PMNs after killing of microbes. Herein, we give an updated review of the systems biology\u2010level approaches that have been used to gain an enhanced view of the role of neutrophils during host\u2010pathogen interaction and neutrophil\u2010mediated diseases. We anticipate that these and future systems\u2010level studies will continue to provide information important for understanding, treatment, and control of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms.",

        "abstract": "Background & Aims: Liver fibrosis is a common consequence of chronic liver injury and is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix mainly generated from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). At present, the mechanisms underlying liver fibrogenesis remain obscure and effective pharmacological therapies are lacking. Neutrophil-specific microRNA-223 (miR-223) plays an important role in controlling the development of various liver diseases; however, its role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis remains unclear. Methods: Liver fibrosis was induced by chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injection of miR-223 knockout (miR-223KO) mice and littermate wild-type controls. MiR-223 was overexpressed in cultured HSCs to determine its function and targets during HSC activation and proliferation. The expression of miR-223 and pri-miR-223 was examined in primary HSCs isolated from CCl4-treated mice and in cultured HSCs. The communication between HSCs and neutrophils was studied by performing in vitro co-culture experiments. Results: Genetic deletion of miR-223 exacerbated chronic CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Administration of miR-223 inhibited liver fibrosis by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)-Indian hedgehog (IHH)-GLI Family Zinc Finger 2 (GLI2) pathway via the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs. Overexpression of miR-223 also directly attenuated Gli2 as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1/\u03b2 (Pdgfra/b) expression in HSCs, thereby suppressing HSC activation and proliferation. The expression of pri-miR-223 and miR-223 was downregulated during HSC activation in vitro. Expression of pri-miR-223 was also decreased in activated HSCs in vivo in fibrotic livers but mature miR-223 expression was not reduced. Finally, in co-culture experiments, activated HSCs were able to take up miR-223-enriched extracellular vesicles from neutrophils, resulting in elevation of miR-223. Conclusion: MiR-223 restricts liver fibrosis by targeting multiple genes in hepatocytes and HSCs, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neutrophils are key mediators of inflammation during acute liver injury (ALI). Emerging evidence suggests that they also contribute to injury resolution and tissue repair. However, the different neutrophil subsets involved in these processes and their kinetics are undefined. Herein, we characterized neutrophil kinetics and heterogeneity during ALI. Methods: We used the carbon tetrachloride model of ALI and employed flow cytometry, tissue imaging, and quantitative RT-PCR to characterize intrahepatic neutrophils during the necroinflammatory early and late repair phases of the wound healing response to ALI. We FACS sorted intrahepatic neutrophils at key time points and examined their transcriptional profiles using RNA-sequencing. Finally, we evaluated neutrophil protein translation, mitochondrial function and metabolism, reactive oxygen species content, and neutrophil extracellular traps generation. Results: We detected 2 temporarily distinct waves of neutrophils during (1) necroinflammation (at 24 hours after injury) and (2) late repair (at 72 hours). Early neutrophils were proinflammatory, characterized by: (1) upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, (2) activation of the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway, (3) reduction of protein translation, (4) decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and (5) higher propensity to generate reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps. In contrast, late neutrophils were prorepair and enriched in genes and pathways associated with tissue repair and angiogenesis. Finally, early proinflammatory neutrophils were characterized by the expression of a short isoform of C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, while the late prorepair neutrophils were characterized by the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4. Conclusions: This study underscores the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and their dual role in inflammation and tissue repair during ALI.",
