        "title": "Effects of doxazosin in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation versus doxazosin standard and placebo in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin Investigators' Study Group.",
        "abstract": "The alpha 1-blocker doxazosin is a well-established therapy for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, in its standard form, a multiple-step titration regimen is usually required. The new gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin greatly minimizes the need for titration by changing drug-delivery rate and the pharmaco-kinetic profile. To demonstrate this in hypertensive patients, we assessed the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily versus doxazosin standard 1-8 mg once daily, and placebo, in an integrated analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trials. Each trial included a 2-week washout period and 12 weeks of therapy. One study compared doxazosin GITS, doxazosin standard, and placebo in 392 patients with mild hypertension [blood pressure (BP) 95-105/ < or = 180 mm Hg]; the other study compared doxazosin GITS with doxazosin standard in 315 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (BP 95-115/ < or = 220 mm Hg). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of responders (sitting diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg or 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline 24 h after the dose) at the final visit for the per-protocol population. Mean baseline BP and heart rate were well matched in each group. Approximately 64% of patients with doxazosin GITS (198 of 309 patients) and 68% with doxazosin standard (207 of 304 patients) achieved goal BP response at the final visit versus 36% with placebo (25 of 70 patients; p < 0.05). The majority with doxazosin GITS (60%) remained at the initial 4-mg starting dose. Doxazosin GITS was as effective as doxazosin standard, and both were more effective than placebo in controlling BP in mild-to-moderate hypertension. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated, and fewer patients with the GITS formulation discontinued therapy because of side effects compared with doxazosin standard or placebo. Syncope was not reported with doxazosin GITS. Whereas the efficacy of doxazosin GITS at 4 or 8 mg is equivalent to that of the standard regimen in this combined analysis, the GITS formulation appears to eliminate the need for titration in most patients.",

        "title": "Double\u2013Blind Trial of the Efficacy and Tolerability of Doxazosin in the Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System, Doxazosin Standard, and Placebo in Patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia",
        "abstract": "Background: The \u03b11\u2013blocker doxazosin mesylate is an established efficacious and welltolerated treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (PBH). However, its clinical utility can be limited by the need for multiple titration steps, starting at an initial dose of 1 mg, increased up to 8 mg once daily, to achieve optimal therapeutic response. A new controlled\u2013release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin mesylate enhances the pharmacokinetic profile and drug delivery rate, reducing the plasma doxazosin mesylate peak\u2013to\u2013trough ratio and minimizing the need for titration.Objective: A study was conducted to assess the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily, doxazosin standard 1 mg to 8 mg once daily, and placebo, in 795 men with BPH. This randomized, double\u2013blind, multicenter Scandinavian study included a 2\u2013week washout period, 2\u2013week single\u2013blind placebo run\u2013in phase, and 13\u2013week double\u2013blind treatment phase. Doxazosin GITS was initiated at 4 mg once daily and titrated to 8 mg once daily after 7 weeks, if indicated, and doxazosin standard was initiated at 1 mg once daily, titrated to 2 mg after 1 week, to 4 mg at 3 weeks, and to 8 mg at 7 weeks if indicated, to achieve symptom control. The primary outcome measures were mean changes from baseline to the final visit for International Prostate Symptom Score (I\u2013PSS) and maximum urinary flow rate adjusted for baseline values.Results: Both doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard significantly improved the symptoms of BPH, as evidenced by least\u2013squares mean reductions in total I\u2013PSS of \u20138.0\u00b10.3 and \u20138.4\u00b10.3 from baseline, respectively, compared with a reduction of \u20136.0\u00b10.4 in patients on placebo. Doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard produced clinically comparable improvements in maximum urinary flow rates, with a greater improvement observed earlier following treatment with doxazosin GITS than with doxazosin standard. Both active treatments produced significantly greater increases in maximum urinary flow rate compared with placebo. Nearly half of the patients on doxazosin GITS achieved symptom relief at the 4\u2013mg starting dose. A similar number of patients in both doxazosin groups were titrated to the maximum dose of 8 mg for both formulations. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar among patients treated with doxazosin GITS and placebo, and slightly higher in those on doxazosin standard. There was no apparent difference in the type of adverse events reported for the two formulations of doxazosin, although most adverse events were reported at a lower frequency with doxazosin GITS.Conclusions: Doxazosin GITS is significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the clinical symptoms of BPH and improving maximum urinary flow rate, and as effective as doxazosin standard. A therapeutic effect equivalent to that of doxazosin standard was achieved with doxazosin GITS with fewer titration steps, in a manner that appeared to be better tolerated. Because treatment with doxazosin GITS starts with an effective dose for many patients, it is likely that this clinical profile will result in the need for fewer patient visits than with doxazosin standard therapy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nPatients with cloacal anomalies often suffer bladder dysfunction with recurrent urinary infections and incontinence. We examined the effect of surgical reconstruction by posterior sagittal approach and total urogenital mobilization in either causing or worsening bladder dysfunction.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBetween August 2000 and December 2002 all new patients with cloacal anomalies were prospectively studied to assess the effect of surgical reconstruction by posterior sagittal approach and total urogenital mobilization on bladder function. A comparable group of patients with anorectal malformation (ARM) were studied as comparative controls to assess the effect of posterior sagittal approach without urogenital surgery. Structural anatomy was defined by radiology. Natural filling urodynamics via suprapubic catheter were performed in all infants at 0.2 to 9 months (mean 3) before surgical reconstruction. This assessment was repeated 6 to 24 months (mean 14.8) after surgery, and changes in bladder function were determined by comparative statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 10 patients with cloacal anomalies (5 with short [less than 3 cm] and 5 with long common channel [greater than 3 cm]) and 20 patients with anorectal malformation were consecutively studied. At presentation bladder dysfunction was present in 9 of 10 patients with cloacal anomalies and in 12 of 20 patients with ARM. After surgery there was significant deterioration in bladder function in half of the cloacal group (5 of 10 patients, p = 0.04) and in 1 of 20 patients with ARM (p = 0.7). Of the 5 patients with cloacal anomalies who had deterioration of bladder function urodynamic pattern of detrusor overactivity changed to inadequate (atonic) bladder in 4, all of whom had a long common channel at presentation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with cloacal malformation have a high incidence of innate bladder dysfunction. However, surgical reconstruction by total urogenital mobilization can cause further deterioration of bladder function, particularly in the group with a long common channel. Urodynamic assessment is necessary to detect bladder dysfunction in these patients.",

        "title": "Alpha\u2010adrenoceptors are a common denominator in the pathophysiology of erectile function and BPH/LUTS \u2013 implications for clinical practice",
        "abstract": "A literature search of PubMed documented publications and abstracts from proceedings of scientific meetings was made to review the available data on benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) with a special focus on the role of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptors as critical mediators of pathophysiology. The reader is introduced to clinical results on the therapeutic potential of \u03b1\u2010blockers alone and in combination with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE\u20105) inhibitors in the treatment of ED associated with LUTS/BPH. Epidemiological studies clearly show that an association exists between ED and LUTS/BPH. The severity of LUTS is correlated with the risk for ED. A significant number of LUTS/BPH patients are nonresponsive to the common ED treatment with PDE\u20105 inhibitors. As smooth muscle contractility is regulated by adrenoceptors in the corpus cavernosum, prostate and detrusor, the \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor system may be considered a common pathophysiological mediator in the development of ED and LUTS/BPH. Blockade of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptors for the treatment of BPH/LUTS may have the potential of improving sexual function. Conversely, PDE\u20105 inhibitors may exhibit positive effects in LUTS patients. Pilot studies on combination regimens of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor antagonists and PDE\u20105 inhibitors have yielded encouraging results in LUTS patients with persistent ED. On the basis of pharmacological and clinical evidence, it is established that the \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of ED and LUTS secondary to BPH. Larger trials on the combination of \u03b1\u2010adrenoceptor antagonists with PDE\u20105 inhibitors are necessary to develop an integrated treatment approach for BPH/LUTS patients with comorbid ED.",

Numerous authors evaluated the actions of PDE5i in improving the LUTS/(benign prostate hyperplasia) BPH.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day vs. tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day plus tadalafil 20 mg/day in patients with LUTS in a crossover design study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES\nInternational Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), IPSS Quality of Life (IPSS-QOL), maximum flow rate (Qmax), post-void residual volume (PVR), International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EF), Global Assessment Quality (GAQ). For the statistical analysis, a Tukey-Kramer multicomparison test was used.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted from September 2007 to February 2008 in one center. Thirty men, older than 50 years old, with a history of LUTS/BPH of at least 6 months, were randomized into two groups to receive tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day vs. tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day plus tadalafil 20 mg/day for 45 days, and then switched to the other treatment mode for other 45 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-seven patients completed the study. Improvements of IPSS score and IPSS-QOL were significant with both treatments but greater with the drug combination. Both regimens similarly improved the Qmax and decreased the PVR volume from baseline (P < 0.001) with no significant differences between tamsulosin alone vs. tamsulosin and tadalafil (P > 0.05). The IIEF improved with tamsulosin plus tadalafil (P < 0.001) but not with tamsulosin alone (P > 0.05). The GAQ showed that all patients preferred the combination scheme. Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION; Tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day plus tadalafil 20 mg/day was more effective than tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day alone to improve LUTS and erectile dysfunction and was also well tolerated.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nAlpha1-blockers (AB) are the first-line monotherapy for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are the first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). Numerous studies have supposed a significant association between ED and LUTS, but a causal relationship cannot be established.\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim was to evaluate the efficacy of a combined therapy with an AB (alfuzosin) and PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil) in patients with LUTS and ED.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a randomized, open-label, three-arm study. A total of 66 men complaining of ED and LUTS were included in the study. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of study treatment, and then underwent randomized allocation to either alfuzosin 10 mg once a day (22 patients) or tadalafil 20 mg on alternative days (21 patients), or a combination of both (23 patients).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nAll participants completed the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS).

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is prevalent in old men and often results in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, etc.) are first-line treatments for erectile dysfunction. Recently, PDE5 inhibitors have been found to regulate smooth muscle tone in human prostate. This article focuses on the use of PDE5 inhibitors for BPH/LUTS treatment and highlights the clinical significance. Recent findings Preclinical and clinical studies have provided promising evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may be an effective and well tolerated treatment option for BPH/LUTS. Combination therapy using PDE5 inhibitors and \u03b11-adrenergic blockers resulted in greater improvements in BPH/LUTS than did either drug alone. Summary There has been increasing interest in the use of PDE5 inhibitors to treat BPH/LUTS. Combination of PDE5 inhibitors and \u03b11-adrenergic blockers may have an additive beneficial effect on BPH/LUTS compared with monotherapy. Mechanisms of action of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate/PDE5 pathway in the treatment of BPH/LUTS deserve further investigations. Larger-scale, well designed clinical trials in future are needed to ascertain the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in elder men and a number of drugs alone or combined are clinically used for this disorder. But available studies investigating the comparative effects of different drug therapies are limited. This study was aimed to compare the efficacy of different drug therapies for LUTS/BPH with network meta-analysis. Materials and Methods An electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different drug therapies for LUTS/BPH within 24 weeks. Comparative effects were calculated using Aggregate Data Drug Information System. Consistency models of network meta-analysis were created and cumulative probability was used to rank different therapies. Results A total 66 RCTs covering seven different therapies with 29384 participants were included. We found that \u03b1-blockers (ABs) plus phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) ranked highest in the test of IPSS total score, storage subscore and voiding subscore. The combination therapy of ABs plus 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors was the best for increasing maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) with a mean difference (MD) of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.86) as compared to placebo. ABs plus muscarinic receptor antagonists (MRAs) ranked secondly on the reduction of IPSS storage subscore, although monotherapies including MRAs showed no effect on this aspect. Additionally, PDE5-Is alone showed great effectiveness for LUTS/BPH except Qmax. Conclusions Based on our novel findings, combination therapy, especially ABs plus PDE5-Is, is recommended for short-term treatment for LUTS/BPH. There was also evidence that PDE5-Is used alone was efficacious except on Qmax. Additionally, it should be cautious when using MRAs. However, further clinical studies are required for longer duration which considers more treatment outcomes such as disease progression, as well as basic research investigating mechanisms involving PDE5-Is and other pharmacologic agents alleviate the symptoms of LUTS/BPH.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO) represents one of the most common clinical complaints in men. Physical activity might represent a viable first-line intervention for treating LUTS/BPO. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of physical activity for lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO). SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP); checked the reference lists of retrieved articles; and handsearched abstract proceedings of conferences with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status from database inception to 6 November 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We included published and unpublished randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials that included men diagnosed with LUTS/BPO. We excluded studies in which medical history suggested non-BPO causes of LUTS or prior invasive therapies to physical activity or that used electrical stimulation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We assessed primary outcomes (symptom score for LUTS; response rate, defined as 20% improvement in symptom score; withdrawal due to adverse events) and secondary outcomes (change of medication use; need for an invasive procedure; postvoid residual urine). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies that randomised 652 men over 40 years old with moderate or severe LUTS. The four different comparisons were as follows:Physical activity versus watchful waitingTwo RCTs randomised 119 participants. The interventions included tai chi and pelvic floor exercise. The evidence was overall of very low quality, and we are uncertain about the effects of physical activity on symptom score for LUTS (mean difference (MD) -8.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.2 to -3.1); response rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.02; 286 more men per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 1079 more); and withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.69; 0 fewer men per 1000, 95% CI 205 fewer to 345 more).Physical activity as part of self-management programme versus watchful waitingTwo RCTs randomised 362 participants. Pelvic floor exercise was one of multiple intervention components. The evidence was of very low quality, and we are uncertain about the effects of physical activity for symptom score for LUTS (MD -6.2, 95% CI -9.9 to -2.5); response rate (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.21; 424 more men per 1000, 95% CI 100 more to 1000 more); and withdrawal due to adverse events (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.06; 65 fewer men per 1000, 95% CI 65 fewer to 65 fewer).Physical activity as part of weight reduction programme versus watchful waitingOne RCT randomised 130 participants. An unclear type of intense exercise was one of multiple intervention components. The evidence was of very low quality, and we are uncertain about the effects for symptom score for LUTS (MD -1.1, 95% CI -3.5 to 1.3); response rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.94; 67 more men per 1000, 95% CI 87 fewer to 313 more); and withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.57; 184 more men per 1000, 95% CI 9 more to 459 more).Physical activity versus alpha-blockersOne RCT randomised 41 participants to pelvic floor exercise or alpha-blockers. The evidence was of very low quality, and we are uncertain about the effects for symptom score for LUTS (MD 2.8, 95% CI -0.9 to 6.4) and response rate (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 167 fewer men per 1000, 95% CI 375 fewer to 125 more). The evidence was of low quality for withdrawal due to adverse events; the effects for this outcome may be similar between interventions (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.89; 7 fewer men per 1000, 95% CI 49 fewer to 626 more). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We rated the quality of the evidence for most of the effects of physical activity for LUTS/BPO as very low. We are therefore uncertain whether physical activity affects symptom scores for LUTS, response rate, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Our confidence in the estimates was lowered due to study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. Additional high-quality research is necessary.",

        "abstract": "The aim of our study will be to evaluate the effect of combining pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the urgency-suppression technique and silodosin in comparison with silodosin alone in men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Overactive Bladder (OAB) after 12 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome will be a change in the number of voidings and intensity of urgencies over 24 h using a micturition diary, and the secondary outcomes will be a change in lower urinary tract symptoms, a change in incontinence quality of life, a change in patients\u2019 global impression of improvement, and a lower incidence of adverse events. A randomized intervention parallel multicenter study will be conducted in collaboration with 45 urological clinics at the national level. Patients will be assigned at a 1:1 ratio to the experimental and control groups using simple randomization according to odd and even patient sequence numbers in each ambulatory clinic. The experimental group will receive oral silodosin at a daily dose of 8 mg once daily and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) 5 times a week for 20\u201330 min a day, for 12 weeks. The control group will receive oral treatment with silodosin at a daily dose of 8 mg once daily for 12 weeks. The study protocol presents the starting points and design of a randomized, interventional, parallel, multicenter study looking at the effect of a combination of silodosin and PFMT versus silodosin treatment in men with BPH and OAB.",
