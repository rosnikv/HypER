        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nUncontrolled studies have suggested that methotrexate may be effective in patients with active ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral methotrexate in chronic steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with active ulcerative colitis who have received steroids and/or immunosuppressives for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months with a current Mayo Clinic score of > or = 7 were included in the study. Methotrexate (12.5 mg) or placebo was added to their treatment once weekly for 9 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-seven patients were included (methotrexate, 30 patients, placebo, 37 patients). The proportion of patients entering first remission (methotrexate, 46.7%; placebo, 48.6%), the time to reach first remission (methotrexate, 4.1 +/- 1.9 months; placebo, 3.4 +/- 1.7 months), as well as the proportions of patients having a relapse after first remission (methotrexate, 64.3%; placebo, 44.4%) were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean Mayo Clinic score, the mean monthly steroid dose, and the proportion of abnormal laboratory results during the study were also similar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg was not found to be better than placebo in the induction or maintenance of remission in patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis.",

        "title": "The continuing unethical conduct of underpowered clinical trials.",
        "abstract": "Despite long-standing critiques of the conduct of underpowered clinical trials, the practice not only remains widespread, but also has garnered increasing support. Patients and healthy volunteers continue to participate in research that may be of limited clinical value, and authors recently have offered 2 related arguments to support the validity and value of underpowered clinical trials: that meta-analysis may \"save\" small studies by providing a means to combine the results with those of other similar studies to enable estimates of an intervention's efficacy, and that although small studies may not provide a good basis for testing hypotheses, they may provide valuable estimates of treatment effects using confidence intervals. In this article, we examine these arguments in light of the distinctive moral issues associated with the conduct of underpowered trials, the disclosures that are owed to potential participants in underpowered trials so they may make autonomous enrollment decisions, and the circumstances in which the prospects for future meta-analyses may justify individually underpowered trials. We conclude that underpowered trials are ethical in only 2 situations: small trials of interventions for rare diseases in which investigators document explicit plans for including their results with those of similar trials in a prospective meta-analysis, and early-phase trials in the development of drugs or devices, provided they are adequately powered for defined purposes other than randomized treatment comparisons. In both cases, investigators must inform prospective subjects that their participation may only indirectly contribute to future health care benefits.",

        "title": "Low-dose methotrexate in ulcerative colitis: still a matter of debate.",
        "abstract": "We read with interest the review by Fraser [1] on the efficacy and tolerability of methotrexate in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The author reported data from the literature showing that the drug is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn\u2019s disease, while only a few studies, and with controversial findings, had focused on the possible role in ulcerative colitis. As summarised in the article, after early positive reports by Kozarek and colleagues [2] and Baron and colleagues [3], methotrexate was tested in only one controlled study, by Oren and colleagues [4], who failed to demonstrate a superiority of the agent with respect to placebo. It is likely that the negative results emerging from that trial considerably reduced the confidence of the investigators as to the possible role of methotrexate in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, although no further controlled study has since confirmed the lack of efficacy of the immunosuppressor in this disease. It is worthwhile pointing out that, in a study by Mate-Jimenez and colleagues [5], methotrexate at a dosage of 15 mg/week led to remission in about 60% of treated ulcerative colitis patients, although only 14% of these remained free from flare-up during the ensuing maintenance period. As reported in our recent paper [6], methotrexate at a dosage of 12.5 mg/week in ten patients who were steroid-dependent/resistant and intolerant/not responding to azathioprine induced remission or resulted in a consistent clinical, endoscopic and histological improvement in 60 and 40% of patients, respectively. Oral steroids were tapered and then discontinued in all treated patients. Furthermore, during a median maintenance period of 2 years, all patients who had gone into remission and some 50% of those showing improvement remained free from flare-up. After our study, similar data were described in a brief report by Siveke and Folwaczny [7]. Numerous and varying reasons may have triggered these different results in studies in which methotrexate was given to ulcerative colitis patients. Quite apart from the methodological differences between open studies and controlled trials, the route of administration \u2013 oral in the trials of Oren et al. and Mate-Jimenez et al. and parenteral in the other studies \u2013 may be an important factor influencing the efficacy of the drug: it is possible that the oral route could be responsible for irregular absorption of methotrexate or may lead to low compliance of the patients, especially with a long-term regimen (patients often reduce the total number of tablets). Differences in dosage, which in the literature ranges from 12.5 to 25 mg/week, as well as differences in the criteria adopted to define the efficacy of therapy (on the basis only of the clinical response, clinical response plus endoscopy alone or in association with histology), may also be important in the judgement of efficacy of a regimen.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 Cutaneous erosions and ulcerations in the diaper area are common in infancy and usually result from local irritation. We describe an infant with chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive who developed extensive ulcerations in the inguinal folds and perineum that were initially thought to be exclusively caused by local irritation. A cutaneous examination found signs consistent with those of pyoderma gangrenosum, leading to a diagnosis of infantile Crohn disease. Cutaneous signs can lead to the diagnosis of an underlying systemic disease in infants with chronic diarrhea and rash. Prompt diagnosis is especially important in infantile Crohn disease, since many infants require surgical resection of affected bowel, and 60% die from disease complications. This article reports a rare instance of an infant who developed pyoderma gangrenosum due to Crohn disease and reviews cutaneous signs of systemic disease in infants presenting with chronic diarrhea and rash.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotics, increasing their water solubility. SULTs are not only important for xenobiotic detoxification but they also play important biological roles in the regulation of the activities of various biosignaling molecules and other cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of influenza A virus lung infection on the expression of SULTs in the lung, brain, and liver of female C57BL/6 mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time that SULT2B1b enzyme activity and protein expression are significantly up-regulated in the lung and brain of female mice in response to lung influenza A virus infection. Real-time quantitative PCR results are consistent with Western blot and enzymatic activity data. In mouse liver, mSULT2B1b is not significantly changed. Enzyme activities, protein expression, and mRNA expression of SULT1A1 and SULT2A1 in the lung, brain, and liver of mice were not significantly affected by the infection. The induction of SULT2B1b may be used to inactivate natural liver X receptor ligands and activate the proliferation of T cells in response to influenza A virus infection in the lung and brain of mice. Our results raise the possibility that regulation of SULT2B1b may influence acquired immune responses to infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "Cytosolic sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) catalyzes the sulfation of 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroids and functions as a selective cholesterol and oxysterol sulfotransferase. Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by oxysterols has been known to be an antiproliferative factor. Overexpression of SULT2B1b impairs LXR's response to oxysterols, by which it regulates lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate in vivo and in vitro effects of SULT2B1b on liver proliferation and the underlying mechanisms. Primary rat hepatocytes and C57BL/6 mice were infected with adenovirus encoding SULT2B1b. Liver proliferation was determined by measuring the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining labeling index. The correlation between SULT2B1b and PCNA expression in mouse liver tissues was determined by double immunofluorescence. Gene expressions were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. SULT2B1b overexpression in mouse liver tissues increased PCNA-positive cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increased expression of PCNA in mouse liver tissues was only observed in the SULT2B1b transgenic cells. Small interference RNA SULT2B1b significantly inhibited cell cycle regulatory gene expressions in primary rat hepatocytes. LXR activation by T0901317 effectively suppressed SULT2B1b-induced gene expression in vivo and in vitro. SULT2B1b may promote hepatocyte proliferation by inactivating oxysterol/LXR signaling.",

        "abstract": "Oxysterol sulfation plays an important role in regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we report the discovery of a novel regulatory sulfated oxysterol in nuclei of primary rat hepatocytes after overexpression of the gene encoding mitochondrial cholesterol delivery protein (StarD1). Forty-eight hours after infection of the hepatocytes with recombinant StarD1 adenovirus, a water-soluble oxysterol product was isolated and purified by chemical extraction and reverse-phase HPLC. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified the oxysterol as 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol, disulfate (25HCDS), and confirmed the structure by comparing with a chemically synthesized compound. Administration of 25HCDS to human THP-1-derived macrophages or HepG2 cells significantly inhibited cholesterol synthesis and markedly decreased lipid levels in vivo in NAFLD mouse models. RT-PCR showed that 25HCDS significantly decreased SREBP-1/2 activities by suppressing expression of their responding genes, including ACC, FAS, and HMG-CoA reductase. Analysis of lipid profiles in the liver tissues showed that administration of 25HCDS significantly decreased cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides by 30, 25, and 20%, respectively. The results suggest that 25HCDS inhibits lipid biosynthesis via blocking SREBP signaling. We conclude that 25HCDS is a potent regulator of lipid metabolism and propose its biosynthetic pathway.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) has recently been identified as an attractive target for atherosclerosis intervention. Given potential relevance of 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol, 3-sulphate (CHOS) and PPAR\u03b3, an integrated docking method was used to study their interaction mechanisms, with the full considerations to distinct CHOS conformations and dynamic ensembles of PPAR\u03b3 ligand-binding domain (PPAR\u03b3-LBD). The results revealed that this novel platform is satisfactory to the accurate determination of binding profiles, and the binding pattern of CHOS is rather similar as those of current PPAR\u03b3 full/partial agonists. CHOS contributes to the stabilization of the AF2 and \u03b2-sheet surfaces of PPAR\u03b3-LBD and promotes the configuration adjustment of \u03a9 loop, in order to inhibit the Cdk5-mediated PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation. Nonetheless, there are clear differences in term of occupation of full or partial agonist-like binding models. The energetic and geometric analyses further revealed that CHOS may be fond of partial agonist-like binding, and its sulfonic group and carbon skeleton are helpful for the binding process. We hope that the results will aid our understanding of recognitions involving CHOS with PPAR\u03b3-LBD and warrant the further aspects to pharmacological experiments. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
