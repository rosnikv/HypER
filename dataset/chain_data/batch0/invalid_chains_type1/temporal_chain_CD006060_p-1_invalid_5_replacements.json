        "abstract": "The antidiabetic compound pioglitazone, an activator of the intracellular peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3, and decreases metabolic and vascular insulin resistance. The drug is well tolerated, and its metabolic effects include improvements in blood glucose and lipid control. Vascular effects consist of improvements in endothelial function and hypertension, and a reduction in surrogate markers of artherosclerosis. In a large, placebo-controlled, outcome study in secondary prevention, PROactive study, the use of pioglitazone in addition to an existing optimized macrovascular risk management resulted in a significant reduction of macrovascular endpoints within a short observation period that was comparable to the effect of statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in other trials. These results underline the value of pioglitazone for managing the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with a metabolic syndrome or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

        "title": "Why insulin sensitizers but not secretagogues should be retained when initiating insulin in type 2 diabetes",
        "abstract": "The stringent targets set for HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes are currently achieved by fewer than half the patients in the United States. Failure to manage hyperglycaemia in the early stages of disease results in progressive loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function, which ultimately necessitates the initiation of insulin therapy. At this point, choices have to be made on whether to continue oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy and, if so, with which agent(s). Historically, sulfonylureas have been the mainstay of oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy; however, their long\u2010term efficacy in patients with depleted \u03b2\u2010cell capacity is doubtful, and other classes of oral anti\u2010diabetic drugs, notably the insulin sensitizers, may prove more reliable. These agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones) appear to provide various benefits over and above sustained glycaemic control, which may variably include reduced loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function as well as improvements to cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Metformin also limits weight gain associated with insulin therapy. This manuscript presents the case that when insulin therapy is initiated it should be tailored to individual needs through combination with one or more insulin sensitizers rather than a secretagogue.

        "abstract": "Hypoglycemia has for the most part been studied inadequately for both of the commonly used long-acting insulin analogs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Almost all existing trials have been designed to investigate changes in glycemic control and not differences in hypoglycemia events. In this review, we present an overview of the hypoglycemic data available from the randomized controlled trials comparing insulin glargine and insulin detemir with NPH or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The limited head-to-head glargine versus detemir data are also discussed with comments on early results relating to the newer insulin analog, degludec. Basal insulin analogs are associated with reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Most studies have excluded participants with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia or previous severe events, however, and hypoglycemia reporting is variable and inconsistent. This limits interpretation for those with long-duration type 1 diabetes, and particularly impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, or long-duration more insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes. New optimally designed studies are required to elucidate the true impact of basal analogs on hypoglycemia burden in those living with long-term insulin therapy.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic disease characterised by auto-immune destruction of insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Most cases of T1DM are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence, and it remains the predominant form of the disease in this population. Early identification and treatment of T1DM is important in reducing complications of this form of disease. Because individuals with T1DM lack endogenous insulin production, the current consensus guideline recommends administration of rapid-acting and long-acting analogues for all patients with T1DM to achieve glycaemic goals and reduce insulin-induced side effects like weight gain and hypoglycaemia. It also emphasises that effective use of insulin requires an understanding of various insulin treatment and regimens, sick-day management regarding insulin use, and ability to manage insulin-induced hypoglycaemia to achieve the individualised treatment goals established between the patient, family and diabetes care team. The current consensus guideline has been developed by a panel of experts based on the existing guidelines which aims to provide better clinical practice in the Indian scenario for the management of T1DM.",

Methodology: This prospective, randomized, multicenter, comparative, non-inferiority, open-label, parallel group, phase IV study was conducted in 14 study centers in India. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either Glaritus\u00ae or Lantus\u00ae for 12 weeks. Each week, the dose of insulin was titrated to maintain target fasting blood glucose (FBG) level range of 80 - 120 mg/dL. Results: A total of 171 subjects were randomized (Glaritus\u00ae arm-86; Lantus\u00ae arm-85) and 161 subjects completed the study. The mean change in the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from visit 3 (baseline) to visit 6 (end of trial) in Glaritus\u00ae arm was -0.69 \u00b1 1.81 and in Lantus\u00ae arm was -0.53 \u00b1 1.94. The mean change in glucose levels between week 1 and end of week 11 in Glaritus\u00ae\u00a0arm was -8.81 \u00b1 34.57 and in Lantus\u00ae arm was -5.28 \u00b1 30. At least one hypoglycemic episode was experienced by 27.2% subjects of Glaritus\u00ae arm and 28.6% subjects of Lantus\u00ae arm. A total of 24 adverse events (AEs) such as pain, pyrexia, few infection related including urinary tract infections, metabolic related such as decreased appetite, musculoskeletal, neurological and skin related were reported in the study (Lantus\u00ae arm: 14 AEs; Glaritus\u00ae arm: 10 AEs). Conclusion: In this short term, 12-week study, biosimilar insulin glargine, Glaritus\u00ae, is comparable to the reference product, Lantus\u00ae, when combined with Insulin Lispro\u00ae in terms of glycemic control, risk of hypoglycemia and occurrence of adverse drug reactions among adults with T1DM.",

A 12-week multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study was performed in 52 subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized to once-daily IDegAsp (n = 26) or basal insulin (n = 26). The primary endpoint was percent change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Furthermore, it was analyzed post hoc in subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c. During a follow-up period, percent change in HbA1c was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.161). Daily insulin doses and frequency of overall hypoglycemia were also similar in the two groups. In post hoc analyses, once-daily basal insulin was more effective than IDegAsp in subjects with HbA1c more than or equal to 8.5% (p < 0.05); however, in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant improvement in percent change in HbA1c at week 12, compared with basal insulin (p < 0.01). Although there was no apparent difference in the HbA1c-lowering effects between two groups, when compared in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant effect in comparison with once-daily basal insulin.

The present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of IDegAsp compared with a conventional premixed insulin or basal insulin. We extracted data from citation databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, since inception to 2021. We calculated the mean differences for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), self-measured mean glucose, and postprandial glucose (PPG) and odds ratios for confirmed hypoglycemia events. Compared with twice-daily conventional premixed insulin, twice-daily IDegAsp showed a similar effect on changes in HbA1c, but it significantly reduced FPG and self-measured mean glucose levels. Furthermore, compared to once-daily basal insulin, once-daily IDegAsp had a similar effect on changes in HbA1c, but it significantly reduced self-measured mean glucose and PPG levels. The risk of overall confirmed hypoglycemia was similar between treatments; however, the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia events was significantly lower with IDegAsp than with conventional premixed insulin and basal insulin. Thus, IDegAsp was more effective than conventional premixed insulin and basal insulin at reducing blood glucose with fewer nocturnal hypoglycemia events.",
