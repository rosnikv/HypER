        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

Synovial hyperplasia was compared in SEB-injected V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA), anti-V beta 8 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, and in V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after injection of a non-V beta 8-reactive superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt day 30, increased synovial cells were observed in all SEB-treated mice, but the increase was greatest in the V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. T cell involvement was indicated by the inability of either heat-denatured SEB or SEA to induce severe arthritis, the reduction in the severity of the arthritis on systemic treatment with CSA or anti-V beta 8, and the correlation of synovial hyperplasia with in vitro SEB reactivity of T cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese observations suggest that superantigens can induce chronic arthritis and that the induction and progression of the arthritis requires an underlying T cell defect in anergy induction in addition to exposure to the superantigen.",

        "abstract": "Superantigens (SAgs) have the capacity of stimulating T cells polyclonally. The only requirement for T cells to respond is the expression of particular T-cell receptor (TCR) VP elements (Fleischer & Schrezemeier 1988, MacDonald et al. 1988, White et al. 1989). Any SAg can, therefore, stimulate between 1% and 40% ofthe total T-cell repertoire, with a wide range of peptide specificities. SAgs have the capacity of binding tightly to MHC class II molecules and are, because of the restricted distribution of these molecules, presented mostly by classical antigenpresenting cells (Held et al. 1994, MacDonald et al. 1993). They are produced by bacteria {Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia and Mycoplasma) as exotoxins, by viruses (rabies and cytomegalovirus) as components of the viral particle and by retroviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV) where they are produced after integration of the reverse transcribed genome into the host DNA (AchaOrbea & MacDonald, 1995). Autoreactivity in the absence of autoimmunity is more the rule than the exception. Autoreactive T and B cells can be easily isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals (He et al. 1993, Hohlfeld et al. 1984, Wucherpfennig et al. 1991). In experimental animals, autoimmunity can be induced by injection of autoantigens or can occur spontaneously in certain strains (see below). The discovery of SAgs immediately raised attractive models for the induction of autoimmunity, since the polyclonal activation of T and B cells by SAgs does not distinguish between autoimmune and normal lymphocytes. This activation might break the delicate balance of tolerance. After SAg encounter, a polyclonal activation of T cells occurs, which is usually",

Considering the central role of MHCII molecules in the development and activation of CD4(+) T cells, it is not surprising that the immune system of the patients is severely impaired. BLS is the prototype of a \"disease of gene regulation.\" The affected genes encode RFXANK, RFX5, RFXAP, and CIITA, four regulatory factors that are highly specific and essential for MHCII genes. The first three are subunits of RFX, a trimeric complex that binds to all MHCII promoters. CIITA is a non-DNA-binding coactivator that functions as the master control factor for MHCII expression. The study of RFX and CIITA has made major contributions to our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms controlling MHCII genes and has made this system into a textbook model for the regulation of gene expression.",

        "abstract": "GM-CSF stimulates the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors and also affects mature cell function. These effects have led to the use of GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant with promising results; however, the mechanisms underlying GM-CSF-mediated immune potentiation are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the immune stimulatory role of GM-CSF is in part due to effects on class II MHC Ag presentation. We find that, in primary human monocytes treated for 24\u201348 h, GM-CSF increases surface class II MHC expression and decreases the relative level of the invariant chain-derived peptide, CLIP, bound to surface class II molecules. GM-CSF also increases expression of the costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40, but not the differentiation marker CD1a or CD16. Furthermore, GM-CSF-treated monocytes are better stimulators in a mixed leukocyte reaction. Additional analyses of the class II pathway revealed that GM-CSF increases total protein and RNA levels of HLA-DR, DM, and DO\u03b1. Expression of class II transactivator (CIITA) types I and III, but not IV, transcripts increases in response to GM-CSF. Furthermore, GM-CSF increases the amount of CIITA associated with the DR promoter. Thus, our data argue that the proinflammatory role of GM-CSF is mediated in part through increased expression of key molecules involved in the class II MHC pathway via induction of CIITA.",

Regulation of class II MHC expression primarily occurs at the transcriptional level. The class II transactivator protein is the master regulator that is essential for both constitutive and interferon-gamma-inducible class II MHC expression. Estrogen [17beta-estradiol (17beta-E2)] has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we show that 17beta-E2 down-regulates interferon-gamma inducible class II MHC protein levels on brain endothelial cells, as well as other cell types (astrocytes, fibrosacroma cells, macrophages). The inhibitory effects of 17beta-E2 on class II MHC expression are not due to changes in class II transactivator mRNA or protein levels, rather, 17beta-E2 mediates inhibition at the level of class II MHC gene expression. We demonstrate that 17beta-E2 attenuates H3 and H4 histone acetylation and cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein association with the class II MHC promoter, suggesting that 17beta-E2 inhibits class II MHC expression by a novel mechanism involving modification of the histone acetylation status of the class II MHC promoter.",

        "abstract": "From early on in evolution, organisms have had to protect themselves from pathogens. Mechanisms for discriminating \"self\" from \"non-self\" evolved to accomplish this task, launching a long history of host-pathogen co-evolution. Evolution of mechanisms of immune defense has resulted in a variety of strategies. Even unicellular organisms have rich arsenals of mechanisms for protection, such as restriction endonucleases, antimicrobial peptides, and RNA interference. In multicellular organisms, specialized immune cells have evolved, capable of recognition, phagocytosis, and killing of foreign cells as well as removing their own cells changed by damage, senescence, infection, or cancer. Additional humoral factors, such as the complement cascade, have developed that co-operate with cellular immunity in fighting infection and maintaining homeostasis. Defensive mechanisms based on germline-encoded receptors constitute a system known as innate immunity. In jaw vertebrates, this system is supplemented with a second system, adaptive immunity, which in contrast to innate immunity is based on diversification of immune receptors and on immunological memory in each individual.Usually, each newly evolved defense mechanism did not replace the previous one, but supplemented it, resulting in a layered structure of the immune system. The immune system is not one system but rather a sophisticated network of various defensive mechanisms operating on different levels, ranging from mechanisms common for every cell in the body to specialized immune cells and responses at the level of the whole organism. Adaptive changes in pathogens have shaped the evolution of the immune system at all levels.",

        "abstract": "CD4+ T cell responses to aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection are characterized by the relatively delayed appearance of effector T cells in the lungs. This delay in the adaptive response is likely critical in allowing the bacteria to establish persistent infection. Because of limitations associated with the detection of low frequencies of na\u00efve T cells, it had not been possible to precisely determine when and where na\u00efve antigen-specific T cells are first activated. We have addressed this problem by using early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6)-specific transgenic CD4 T cells to monitor early T cell activation in vivo. By using an adoptive transfer approach, we directly show that T cell priming to ESAT-6 occurs only after 10 days of infection, is initially restricted to the mediastinal lymph nodes, and does not involve other lymph nodes or the lungs. Primed CD4 T cells rapidly differentiated into proliferating effector cells and ultimately acquired the ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 ex vivo. Initiation of T cell priming was enhanced by two full days depending on the magnitude of the challenge inoculum, which suggests that antigen availability is a factor limiting the early CD4 T cell response. These data define a key period in the adaptive immune response to Mtb infection.",

        "abstract": "In recognition of World TB day (March 24), tuberculosis (TB) experts from New York State and vicinity met to discuss scientific progress and how it can impact control of TB. The meeting was held in Saranac Lake where Dr. E. L. Trudeau first cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) following the guidelines of Dr. Koch and also where Trudeau set up his successful TB sanitarium (Fig. 1). Many attendees were excited to visit this historical center of TB research and treatment however, they left with a profound sense of how much there remains to be done in order to bring TB under control. The majority of the meeting was in a workshop format with speakers providing a 15-min presentation of their recent work in three scientific sessions. The first session was entitled \u2018\u2018Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a potent pathogen\u2019\u2019, the second was \u2018\u2018Tuberculosis: the nature of the human disease\u2019\u2019 and the third was \u2018\u2018Cellular Immunity to tuberculosis: from animal models to human disease\u2019\u2019. At the end of these scientific sessions, a final open discussion session was held entitled \u2018\u2018Vaccination, Drugs and Public Health: the trifecta of tuberculosis control worldwide\u2019\u2019. This consisted of a focused discussion of what is required to improve vaccination, drug development and public health. The meeting was opened with a poem written by a student in 1908 in honor of Dr. E. L. Trudeau\u2019s 60th birthday. Dr. Trudeau started the Trudeau sanitarium and research facilities in Saranac Lake 125 years ago and his legacy lives on in the Trudeau Institute where the meeting was held.

        "title": "Lung Neutrophils Facilitate Activation of Naive Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection",
        "abstract": "Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node and requires transport of M. tuberculosis by migratory dendritic cells (DCs) to the local lymph node. The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

        "title": "Crosstalk between neutrophils and dendritic cells: a context\u2010dependent process",
        "abstract": "Neutrophils are massively and rapidly recruited following infection. They migrate to the site of acute infection and also transiently to dLNs. In addition to their well\u2010established role as microbial killers, accumulating evidence shows that neutrophils can play an immunoregulatory role. Neutrophils were recently shown to influence the activation of different leukocyte types including NK cells, B cells, and DCs. DCs are professional APCs playing a key role to the launching and regulation of the immune response; thus, crosstalk between neutrophils and resident or newly recruited DCs may have a direct impact on the development of the antigen\u2010specific immune response and thereby, on the outcome of infection. Neutrophils may regulate DC recruitment and/or activation. We will review here recent progress in the field, including those presented during the first international symposium on \u201cNeutrophil in Immunity\u201d, held in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, in June 2012, and discuss how neutrophil regulatory action on DCs may differ depending on the type of invading microorganism and local host factors.",

        "title": "Rapid Sequestration of Leishmania mexicana by Neutrophils Contributes to the Development of Chronic Lesion",
        "abstract": "The protozoan Leishmania mexicana parasite causes chronic non-healing cutaneous lesions in humans and mice with poor parasite control. The mechanisms preventing the development of a protective immune response against this parasite are unclear. Here we provide data demonstrating that parasite sequestration by neutrophils is responsible for disease progression in mice. Within hours of infection L. mexicana induced the local recruitment of neutrophils, which ingested parasites and formed extracellular traps without markedly impairing parasite survival. We further showed that the L. mexicana-induced recruitment of neutrophils impaired the early recruitment of dendritic cells at the site of infection as observed by intravital 2-photon microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Indeed, infection of neutropenic Genista mice and of mice depleted of neutrophils at the onset of infection demonstrated a prominent role for neutrophils in this process. Furthermore, an increase in monocyte-derived dendritic cells was also observed in draining lymph nodes of neutropenic mice, correlating with subsequent increased frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting T helper cells, and better parasite control leading ultimately to complete healing of the lesion. Altogether, these findings show that L. mexicana exploits neutrophils to block the induction of a protective immune response and impairs the control of lesion development. Our data thus demonstrate an unanticipated negative role for these innate immune cells in host defense, suggesting that in certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis, regulating neutrophil recruitment could be a strategy to promote lesion healing.",

        "abstract": "Infection of C57BL/6 mice with most Leishmania major strains results in a healing lesion and clearance of parasites from the skin. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain (LmSd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, LmSd elicited early upregulation of IL\u20101\u03b2 mRNA and IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin. Mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, or caspase\u20101/11, or lacking IL\u20101\u03b2 or IL\u20101 receptor signaling, developed healing lesions and cleared LmSd from the infection site. Mice resistant to LmSd had a stronger antigen\u2010specific Th1 response. The possibility that IL\u20101\u03b2 might act through neutrophil recruitment to locally suppress immunity was supported by the healing observed in neutropenic Genista mice. Secretion of mature IL\u20101\u03b2 by LmSd\u2010infected macrophages in vitro was dependent on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome and caspase\u20101. These data reveal that Nlrp3 inflammasome\u2010dependent IL\u20101\u03b2, associated with localized neutrophil recruitment, plays a crucial role in the development of a nonhealing form of cutaneous leishmaniasis in conventionally resistant mice.",

        "abstract": "The origin and functional specialization of dermal macrophages in cutaneous infections have been little studied. In this paper, we show that a strain of Leishmania major (L. major Seidman [LmSd]) that produces nonhealing cutaneous lesions in conventionally resistant C57BL/6 mice was more efficiently taken up by M2-polarized bone marrow (BM)\u2013derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro and by mannose receptor (MR)hi dermal macrophages in vivo compared with a healing strain (L. major Friedlin V1). Both in steady and in T helper type 1 (Th1) cell\u2013driven inflammatory states, the MRhi dermal macrophages showed M2 characteristics. The dermal macrophages were radio resistant and not replaced by monocytes or adult BM-derived cells during infection, but were locally maintained by IL-4 and IL-10. Notably, the favored infection of M2 BMDMs by LmSd in vitro was MR dependent, and genetic deletion of MR or selective depletion of MRhi dermal macrophages by anti\u2013CSF-1 receptor antibody reversed the nonhealing phenotype. We conclude that embryonic-derived, MRhi dermal macrophages are permissive for parasite growth even in a strong Th1-immune environment, and the preferential infection of these cells plays a crucial role in the severity of cutaneous disease.",

        "abstract": "Leishmania are parasitic protists that cause a spectrum of diseases in humans characterized by the formation of granulomatous lesions in the skin or other tissues, such as liver and spleen. The extent to which Leishmania granulomas constrain or promote parasite growth is critically dependent on the host T\u2010helper type 1/T\u2010helper type 2 immune response and the localized functional polarization of infected and noninfected macrophages toward a classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated phenotype. Recent studies have shown that metabolic reprograming of M1 and M2 macrophages underpins the capacity of these cells to act as permissive or nonpermissive host reservoirs, respectively. In this review, we highlight the metabolic requirements of Leishmania amastigotes and the evidence that these parasites induce and/or exploit metabolic reprogramming of macrophage metabolism. We also focus on recent studies highlighting the role of key macrophage metabolic signaling pathways, such as mechanistic target of rapamycin, adenosine monophosphate\u2010activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma in regulating the pathological progression of Leishmania granulomas. These studies highlight the intimate connectivity between Leishmania and host cell metabolism, the need to investigate these interactions in vivo and the potential to exploit host cell metabolic signaling pathways in developing new host\u2010directed therapies.",

        "abstract": "The term \u2018macrophage\u2019 encompasses tissue cells that typically share dependence on the same transcriptional regulatory pathways (e.g. the transcription factor PU.1) and growth factors (e.g. CSF1/IL\u201034). They share a core set of functions that largely arise from a uniquely high phagocytic capacity manifest in their ability to clear dying cells, pathogens and scavenge damaged, toxic or modified host molecules. However, macrophages demonstrate a remarkable degree of tissue\u2010specific functionality and have diverse origins that vary by tissue site and inflammation status. With our understanding of this diversity has come an appreciation of the longevity and replicative capacity of tissue\u2010resident macrophages and thus the realisation that macrophages may persist through tissue perturbations and inflammatory events with important consequences for cell function. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the parameters that regulate macrophage survival and function, focusing on the relative importance of the tissue environment versus cell\u2010intrinsic factors, such as origin, how long a cell has been resident within a tissue and prior history of activation. Thus, we reconsider the view of macrophages as wholly plastic cells and raise many unanswered questions about the relative importance of cell life\u2010history versus environment in macrophage programming and function.",

        "abstract": "Rationale The role of circulating fetal monocytes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not known. We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia. Methods Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen\u2009\u00d7\u200914 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n\u2009=\u20092 term, n\u2009=\u20093 moderate/late preterm, and n\u2009=\u20095 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n\u2009=\u20094 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay. Results Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 vs. 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vessels per lung field; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14. Conclusions Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.",
