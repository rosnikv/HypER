        "abstract": "In a randomized, double blind, multicentre study with 4 weeks follow-up of 290 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee joint, a topical NSAID (eltenac) was compared with oral diclofenac and placebo. The main outcome, Lequesne's Index and pain by VAS showed no statistically significant differences between neither of the active treatments and placebo for the total study population. However, in patients with more severe symptoms, both active groups showed statistically significant differences to placebo. No severe adverse drug reactions were seen but the number of GI reactions were three times higher in the diclofenac group compared to the topical treatment. Local skin reactions were twice as frequent in the eltenac than in the placebo group. Taking into account the nature of the treatment for a chronic disease like OA, our results indicate that eltenac gel could be a safe alternative to oral NSAIDs.",

        "title": "EULAR recommendations for the management of knee osteoarthritis: report of a task force of the Standing Committee for International Clinical Studies Including Therapeutic Trials (ESCISIT)",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease encountered throughout Europe. A task force for the EULAR Standing Committee for Clinical Trials met in 1998 to determine the methodological and logistical approach required for the development of evidence based guidelines for treatment of knee OA. The guidelines were restricted to cover all currently available treatments for knee OA diagnosed either clinically and/or radiographically affecting any compartment of the knee. METHODS The first stage was the selection of treatment modalities to be considered. The second stage comprised a search of the electronic databases Medline and Embase using a combination of subject headings and keywords. All European language publications in the form of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, and observational studies were included. During stage three all the relevant studies were quality scored. The summary statistics for validated outcome measures, when available, were recorded and, where practical, the numbers needed to treat and the effect size for each treatment were calculated. In the fourth stage key clinical propositions were determined by expert consensus employing a Delphi approach. The final stage ranked these propositions according to the available evidence. A second set of propositions relating to a future research agenda was determined by expert consensus using a Delphi approach. RESULTS Over 2400 English language publications and 400 non-English language publications were identified. Seven hundred and forty four studies presented outcome data of the effects of specific treatments on knee OA. Quantitative analysis of treatment effect was possible in only 61 studies. Recommendations for the management of knee OA based on currently available data and expert opinion are presented. Proposals for a future research agenda are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS These are the first clinical guidelines on knee OA to combine an evidence based approach and a consensus approach across a wide range of treatment modalities. It is apparent that certain clinical propositions are supported by substantial research based evidence, while others are not. There is thus an urgent need for future well designed trials to consider key clinical questions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Six new 1-alkylazacycloalkan-2-one esters of ketoprofen (1\u20136) were synthesized and evaluated as potential dermal prodrugs of ketoprofen. Their lipophilicity by both experimental lipophilicity indices (log k\u2032) and calculated ClogP was also determined. In vitro experiments were carried out to evaluate the chemical and enzymatic stability and permeation through excised human skin of these new ketoprofen derivatives. Furthermore, we investigated the in vivo topical anti-inflammatory activity of ester 5, which showed the best in vitro profile, evaluating the ability of this compound to inhibit methyl nicotinate-induced skin erythema on healthy human volunteers. Esters 1\u20136 showed increased lipophilicity compared with the parent drug (ketoprofen), good stability in phosphate buffer pH 7.4, and were readily hydrolyzed by porcine esterase. Results from in vitro percutaneous absorption studies showed that, among all esters synthesized, only for esters 1 and 5 did a higher cumulative amount of drug penetrate through the skin, compared with that obtained after topical application of ketoprofen. In vivo results showed an interesting delayed and sustained activity of ester 5, compared with the parent drugs.",

        "abstract": "The mammalian skin has long been considered to be poor in drug metabolism. However, many reports clearly show that most drug metabolizing enzymes also occur in the mammalian skin albeit at relatively low specific activities. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on drug metabolizing enzymes in the skin of human, rat, and pig, the latter, because it is often taken as a model for human skin on grounds of anatomical similarities. However only little is known about drug metabolizing enzymes in pig skin. Interestingly, some cytochromes P450 (CYP) have been observed in the rat skin which are not expressed in the rat liver, such as CYP 2B12 and CYP2D4. As far as investigated most drug metabolizing enzymes occur in the suprabasal (i.e. differentiating) layers of the epidermis, but the rat CYP1A1 rather in the basal layer and human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase rather in the stratum corneum. The pattern of drug metabolizing enzymes and their localization will impact not only the beneficial as well as detrimental properties of drugs for the skin but also dictate whether a drug reaches the blood flow unchanged or as activated or inactivated metabolite(s).",

        "abstract": "The use of a prodrug, a conjugate of an active drug with a lipophilic substituent, is a good way of increasing the cutaneous absorption of a drug. However, the activity of dermal hydrolases has rarely been investigated in humans, or experimental animals. In the present study, we focused on the identification of rat dermal esterases and the hydrolysis of a prodrug during permeation across rat skin. We found that carboxylesterase (CES), especially the rat CES1 isozyme, Hydrolase A, is expressed in rat skin and that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acyl derivatives and caproyl-propranolol (PL) was 20-fold lower in the 9000g supernatant fraction of skin homogenate than in liver microsomes. A permeation study of caproyl-PL was performed in rat full-thickness and stripped skin using a flow-through diffusion cell. Caproyl-PL was easily partitioned into the stratum corneum and retained, not only in the stratum corneum, but also in viable epidermis and dermis. Caproyl-PL could barely be detected in the receptor fluid after application to either full-thickness or stripped skin. PL, derived from caproyl-PL, was, however, detected in receptor fluid after extensive hydrolysis of caproyl-PL in viable skin. Permeation of PL was markedly decreased under CES inhibition, indicating that the net flux of caproyl-PL is dependent on its conversion rate to PL.",

        "title": "Interspecies Differences in the Metabolism of a Multiester Prodrug by Carboxylesterases.",
        "abstract": "The pentaethyl ester prodrug of the chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) referred to as C2E5 is being developed as an orally bioavailable radionuclide decorporation agent. The predicted human efficacy obtained in these experimental animals is confounded by interspecies variations of metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, carboxylesterase-mediated metabolism of [(14)C]-C2E5 was compared in the S9 intestinal and hepatic fractions of human, dog, and rat and their respective plasma. Intestinal hydrolysis of C2E5, resulting in the formation of the tetraethyl ester of DTPA (C2E4), was only detected in human and rat. The primary metabolite in human and dog hepatic fractions was C2E4, whereas the predominant species identified in rat hepatic fractions was the triethyl ester (C2E3). Hepatic hydrolysis of C2E5 causes the formation of C2E4 in human, dog, and rat and C2E3 in rat only. Minimal C2E5 hydrolysis was observed in human and dog plasma, whereas in rat plasma C2E5 converted to C2E3 rapidly, followed by slower further metabolism. Both recombinant CES1 and CES2 play roles in C2E5 metabolism. Together, these data suggest that dogs may be the most appropriate species for predicting human C2E5 metabolism, whereas rats might be useful for clarifying the potential toxicity of C2E5 metabolites.",

        "abstract": "6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) is a glutamine antagonist with robust anticancer efficacy; however, its therapeutic potential was hampered by its biodistribution and toxicity to normal tissues, specifically gastrointestinal (GI) tissues. To circumvent DON's toxicity, we synthesized a series of tumor-targeted DON prodrugs designed to circulate inert in plasma and preferentially activate over DON in tumor. Our best prodrug 6 (isopropyl 2-(6-acetamido-2-(adamantane-1-carboxamido)hexanamido)-6-diazo-5-oxohexanoate) showed stability in plasma, liver, and intestinal homogenates yet was readily cleaved to DON in P493B lymphoma cells, exhibiting a 55-fold enhanced tumor cell-to-plasma ratio versus that of DON and resulting in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Using carboxylesterase 1 knockout mice that were shown to mimic human prodrug metabolism, systemic administration of 6 delivered 11-fold higher DON exposure to tumor (target tissue; AUC0- t = 5.1 nmol h/g) versus GI tissues (toxicity tissue; AUC0- t = 0.45 nmol h/g). In summary, these studies describe the discovery of a glutamine antagonist prodrug that provides selective tumor exposure.",

        "title": "Glutamine mimicry suppresses tumor progression through asparagine metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma",
        "abstract": "In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), glutamine is a critical nutrient that drives a wide array of metabolic and biosynthetic processes that support tumor growth. Despite this established dependency, the targeting of specific enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism is yet to yield any clinical benefit. Here, we have examined the therapeutic potential of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine antagonist that broadly inhibits glutamine metabolism. We found that DON treatment significantly blocks PDAC tumor growth and attenuates metastasis. Interestingly, we link the effectiveness of DON in PDAC to asparagine (Asn) metabolism. By inhibiting asparagine synthetase (ASNS), DON significantly reduces intracellular Asn production and Asn supplementation rescues the anti-proliferative effects of DON. We discern that PDAC cells upregulate expression of ASNS as a metabolic adaptation and that modulating ASNS levels can impact DON efficacy. Strikingly, in patient-derived organoids, DON responsiveness is inversely correlated with ASNS expression, a feature that is not observed for other metabolic enzymes targeted by DON. We find that treatment with L-asparaginase (ASNase), an enzyme that catabolizes free Asn, synergizes with DON to impact the viability of PDAC cells. Finally, we identify that a combination therapy of DON and ASNase has a significant impact on metastasis. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive the effects of glutamine mimicry and point to the utility of co-targeting adaptive responses to control PDAC progression.",

        "abstract": "Overcoming acquired resistance to Osimertinib remains a critical challenge in treating NSCLC. This research indicates that Osimertinib-resistant cells exhibit a strong dependence on glutamine metabolism. However, targeting GLS1 shows limited anticancer effects, probably because it cannot fully block the glutamine metabolic pathway. The investigation reveals that a more effective strategy involves simultaneously inhibiting both ASCT2 and GLS1. After confirming the efficacy of this dual-targeting approach against Osimertinib-resistant cells in preclinical models, the potential of utilizing a broad-spectrum glutamine metabolism antagonist is further explored to achieve superior antitumor efficacy. DON, broad-spectrum glutamine antagonist, presents toxicity issues. Herein, the high NQO1 expression in Osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells is leveraged to design an NQO1-responsive DON prodrug, 10e (LBJ-10e). This prodrug demonstrates superior safety compared to natural DON and greater antitumor activity against resistant tumors compared to the clinical phase II drug DRP104. These findings may address the clinical limitations of GLS1 allosteric inhibitors and underscore prodrug strategies in effectively treating Osimertinib-resistant lung cancer, providing a foundation for future clinical trials.",
