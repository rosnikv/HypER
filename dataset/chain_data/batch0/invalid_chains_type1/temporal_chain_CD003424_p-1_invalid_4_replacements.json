        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHepatic steatosis and fat malabsorption are common in cystic fibrosis (CF). Choline deficiency results in decreased phosphatidylcholine synthesis through the cytidine diphosphocholine-choline pathway and hepatic steatosis and in increased synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine using methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine. The intestinal absorption of phosphatidylcholine in CF is unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective was to determine whether excretion of choline phosphoglyceride (phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine) is increased in CF and whether loss of fecal choline phosphoglyceride is associated with altered plasma methionine cycle metabolites.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cross-sectional study involved 53 children with CF and 18 control children without CF. Blood was collected from all participants. A subset of 18 children with CF and 8 control children provided 72-h fecal samples and 5-d food records.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFat absorption was significantly lower (x+/- SEM: 86.2 +/- 1.6% and 94.1 +/- 1.2%) and excretion of fecal fat (12.9 +/- 1.7 and 3.9 +/- 0.7 g/d), phospholipid (median: 130 and 47.7 mg/d), phosphatidylcholine (19.6 and 2.1 mg/d), and lysophosphatidylcholine (60.3 and 16.9 mg/d) was significantly higher in children with CF than in control children, respectively (P < 0.05). Choline phosphoglyceride excretion was positively correlated with plasma homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine and inversely related with plasma methionine (P < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCholine phosphoglyceride excretion is increased in children with CF and is associated with decreased plasma methionine and increased homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine. These findings suggest choline depletion and an increased choline synthesis by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation in CF, as well as a metabolic link between phosphatidylcholine metabolism and the methionine-homocysteine cycle in humans.",

        "abstract": "S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is the major biological methyl donor. AdoMet's methyl group arises both from the diet (eg, methionine, choline, and betaine) and from de novo synthesis by the process of methylneogenesis. At least 50 AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions have been identified in mammals, and genomic analyses suggest that the final number will be much higher. Such methylation reactions play major roles in biosynthesis, regulation, and detoxification. Creatine synthesis is thought to account for the use of >70% of AdoMet-derived methyl groups in humans. This is not consistent with recent studies in mice, in which the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase gene was deleted (PEMT-/-). Loss of this hepatic enzyme resulted in a 50% decrease in plasma homocysteine, which suggests that it accounts for a major component of whole-body AdoMet utilization. A reexamination of human creatine metabolism showed that dietary creatine can account for as much as 50% of daily creatine requirements in nonvegetarians and, therefore, that estimates of creatine synthesis need to be reduced. We suggest that creatine synthesis is responsible for a smaller proportion of AdoMet-derived methyl groups than has been suggested and that phosphatidylcholine synthesis via phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase is a major consumer of these methyl groups.",

        "title": "Methyl balance and transmethylation fluxes in humans.",
        "abstract": "Various questions have been raised about labile methyl balance and total transmethylation fluxes, and further discussion has been encouraged. This report reviews and discusses some of the relevant evidence now available. The fact that, if needed, labile methyl balance is maintained by methylneogenesis appears to be established, but several aspects of transmethylation remain uncertain: definitive measurements of the rate of total transmethylation in humans of both sexes on various diets and at various ages; the extent to which synthesis of phosphatidylcholine has been underestimated; and the relative contributions of the 2 pathways for the formation of sarcosine (ie, N-methylglycine). The available evidence indicates that the quantitatively most important pathways for S-adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylation in mammals are the syntheses of creatine by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, of phosphatidylcholine by phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, and of sarcosine by glycine N-methyltransferase. Data presented in this report show that S-adenosylmethionine and methionine accumulate abnormally in the plasma of humans with glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency but not of those with guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency or in the plasma or livers of mice devoid of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity. The absence of such accumulations in the latter 2 conditions may be due to removal of S-adenosylmethionine by synthesis of sarcosine. Steps that may help clarify the remaining issues include the determination of the relative rates of synthesis of sarcosine, creatine, and phosphatidylcholine by rapid measurement of the rates of radiolabel incorporation into these compounds from L-[methyl-3H]methionine administered intraportally to an experimental animal; clarification of the intracellular hepatic isotope enrichment value during stable-isotope infusion studies to enhance the certainty of methyl flux estimates during such studies; and definitive measurement of the dietary betaine intake from various diets.",

        "abstract": "In the early 1930s, Banting and Best, the discoverers of insulin, found that choline could prevent the development of fatty liver disease (steatosis) in pancreatectomized dogs treated with insulin. Later work indicated that in rats and mice, diets deficient in labile methyl groups (choline, methionine, betaine, folate) produced fatty liver and that long-term administration of diets deficient in choline and methionine also caused hepatocellular carcinoma. These experiments not only linked steatosis and diabetes but also provided evidence, for the first time, of the importance of labile methyl group balance to maintain normal liver function. This conclusion is now amply supported by the observation of mice devoid of key enzymes of methionine and folate metabolism and in patients with severe deficiencies in these enzymes. Moreover, treatments with various methionine metabolites in experimental animal models of liver disease show hepatoprotective properties.",

        "abstract": "Deletion of glycine N\u2010methyltransferase (GNMT), the main gene involved in liver S\u2010adenosylmethionine (SAM) catabolism, leads to the hepatic accumulation of this molecule and the development of fatty liver and fibrosis in mice. To demonstrate that the excess of hepatic SAM is the main agent contributing to liver disease in GNMT knockout (KO) mice, we treated 1.5\u2010month\u2010old GNMT\u2010KO mice for 6 weeks with nicotinamide (NAM), a substrate of the enzyme NAM N\u2010methyltransferase. NAM administration markedly reduced hepatic SAM content, prevented DNA hypermethylation, and normalized the expression of critical genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. More importantly, NAM treatment prevented the development of fatty liver and fibrosis in GNMT\u2010KO mice. Because GNMT expression is down\u2010regulated in patients with cirrhosis, and because some subjects with GNMT mutations have spontaneous liver disease, the clinical implications of the present findings are obvious, at least with respect to these latter individuals. Because NAM has been used for many years to treat a broad spectrum of diseases (including pellagra and diabetes) without significant side effects, it should be considered in subjects with GNMT mutations. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the anomalous accumulation of SAM in GNMT\u2010KO mice can be corrected by NAM treatment leading to the normalization of the expression of many genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as reversion of the appearance of the pathologic phenotype.

        "abstract": "Glycine N\u2010methyltransferase (GNMT) catabolizes S\u2010adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the main methyl donor of the body. Patients with cirrhosis show attenuated GNMT expression, which is absent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. GNMT\u2212/\u2212 mice develop spontaneous steatosis that progresses to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC. The liver is highly enriched with innate immune cells and plays a key role in the body's host defense and in the regulation of inflammation. Chronic inflammation is the major hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression. The aim of our study was to uncover the molecular mechanisms leading to liver chronic inflammation in the absence of GNMT, focusing on the implication of natural killer (NK) / natural killer T (NKT) cells. We found increased expression of T helper (Th)1\u2010 over Th2\u2010related cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010related apoptosis\u2010inducing ligand (TRAIL)\u2010R2/DR5, and several ligands of NK cells in GNMT\u2212/\u2212 livers. Interestingly, NK cells from GNMT\u2212/\u2212 mice were spontaneously activated, expressed more TRAIL, and had strong cytotoxic activity, suggesting their contribution to the proinflammatory environment in the liver. Accordingly, NK cells mediated hypersensitivity to concanavalin A (ConA)\u2010mediated hepatitis in GNMT\u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, GNMT\u2212/\u2212 mice were hypersensitive to endotoxin\u2010mediated liver injury. NK cell depletion and adoptive transfer of TRAIL\u2212/\u2212 liver\u2010NK cells protected the liver against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) liver damage. Conclusion: Our data allow us to conclude that TRAIL\u2010producing NK cells actively contribute to promote a proinflammatory environment at early stages of fatty liver disease, suggesting that this cell compartment may contribute to the progression of NASH.

        "abstract": "Evaluating the safety of traditional medicinal herbs and their major active constituents is critical for their widespread usage. Geniposide, a major active constituent with a defined structure from the traditional medicinal herb Gardenia jasminoides ELLIS fruit, exhibits remarkable anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic properties and has been used in a variety of medical fields, mainly for the treatment of liver diseases. However, geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity and methods for the early detection of hepatotoxicity have yet to be reported. In this study, geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity was investigated. In addition, candidate biomarkers for the earlier detection of geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity were identified using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach on a geniposide overdose-induced liver injury in a rat model. Using an accurate intensity-based, absolute quantification (iBAQ)-based, one-step discovery and verification approach, a candidate biomarker panel was easily obtained from individual samples in response to different conditions. To determine the biomarkers' early detection abilities, five candidate biomarkers were selected and tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Two biomarkers, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) and glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL), were found to indicate hepatic injuries significantly earlier than the current gold standard liver biomarker. This study provides a first insight into geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity in a rat model and describes a method for the earlier detection of this hepatotoxicity, facilitating the efficient monitoring of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.",

However, the effect of A77 1726 on cardiac hypertrophy remains completely unknown. Herein, we found that A77 1726 treatment attenuated pressure overload or angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, as well as agonist-induced hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes in vitro In addition, we showed that A77 1726 administration prevented induction of cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting cardiac fibroblast (CF) transformation into myofibroblast. Surprisingly, we found that the protective effect of A77 1726 was not dependent on its T lymphocyte-inhibiting property. A77 1726 suppressed the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, and overexpression of constitutively active AKT completely abolished A77 1726-mediated cardioprotective effects in vivo and in vitro Pretreatment with siRNA targetting Fyn (si Fyn) blunted the protective effect elicited by A77 1726 in vitro More importantly, A77 1726 was capable of blocking pre-established cardiac hypertrophy in mice.

However, the role of NLRP3 in cardiac fibrosis is still controversial and remains unclear. The study aims to investigate the role of NLRP3 on cardiac fibrosis induced by isoproterenol (ISO). In vivo, NLRP3 knockout and wild-type mice were subcutaneously injected with ISO to induce the cardiac fibrosis model. The results showed that NLRP3 deficiency alleviated the cardiac fibrosis and inflammation induced by ISO. In vitro, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and primary adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts of NLRP3 knockout and wild-type mice were isolated and challenged with ISO. Adenovirus (Ad-) NLRP3 and small interfering RNAs targeting NLRP3 were used to transfect NRVMs to overexpress or knockdown NLRP3. We found that NLRP3 could regulate high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) secretion via reactive oxygen species production in NRVMs and the HMGB1 secreted by NRVMs promoted the activation and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. Thus, we concluded that the NLRP3/reactive oxygen species/HMGB1 pathway could be the underlying mechanism of ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis.",

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is estimated that by 2045 about 783 million people will be affected by this disease. Diabetes can be treated today with various hypoglycemic drugs, including metformin and sulfonylureas. However, it has unwanted side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, weight gain, liver failure, tachycardia, and lactic acidosis. A newer group of oral diabetes drugs, such as the sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLTi), are recognized as useful in treating blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Natural phytochemicals derived from plants have long been used to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, and traditional phytotherapy for diabetes has been recommended by the world health organization. Herbal medicines are believed to have fewer side effects, so nearly 80% of the drugs are derived directly from plants or modified plants.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThis study aimed to examine the impact of CA on DN and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms of inflammation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe fed C57BL/6 mice injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. In addition, we stimulated NRK-52E cells with 20\u2009mmol/L d-glucose to mimic the diabetic condition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur findings demonstrated that CA effectively reduced blood glucose levels, and improved DN in mice models. Additionally, CA reduced kidney injury and inflammation in both mice models and in vitro models. CA decreased high glucose-induced ferroptosis of NRK-52E cells by inducing GSH/GPX4 axis. Conversely, the ferroptosis activator or the PI3K inhibitor reversed positive effects of CA on DN in both mice and in vitro models. CA suppressed PAQR3 expression in DN models to promote PI3K/AKT activity. The PAQR3 activator reduced the positive effects of CA on DN in vitro models. Moreover, CA directly targeted the PAQR3 protein to enhance the ubiquitination of the PAQR3 protein.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall, our study has uncovered that CA promotes the ubiquitination of PAQR3, leading to the attenuation of ferroptosis in DN. This effect is achieved through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways by disrupting the interaction between PAQR3 and the P110\u03b1 pathway.
