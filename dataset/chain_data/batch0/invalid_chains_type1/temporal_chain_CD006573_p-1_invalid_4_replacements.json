        "abstract": "A randomized, double\u2010blind, dose\u2010escalation study evaluated the safety and efficacy of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010AbXTL68, a neutralizing, high\u2010affinity, fully human, anti\u2010E2 monoclonal antibody, in 24 HCV\u2010positive patients undergoing liver transplantation. HCV\u2010AbXTL68 or placebo was administered at doses from 20\u2010240 mg as 2\u20104 infusions during the first 24 hours after transplantation, followed by daily infusions for 6 days, weekly infusions for 3 weeks, and either 2 or 4 weekly infusions for 8 weeks. Serum concentrations of total anti\u2010E2 obtained during daily infusions of 120\u2010240 mg HCV\u2010AbXTL68 were 50\u2010200 \u03bcg/mL above concentrations in the placebo group. Median serum concentration of HCV RNA dropped below baseline in all groups immediately after transplantation. On day 2, median change from baseline in HCV RNA was \u22121.8 and \u22122.4 log in the 120\u2010mg and 240\u2010mg groups, respectively, compared with \u22121.5 log with placebo. The difference was lost after day 7 when the dosing frequency was reduced. The coincidence of increases in anti\u2010E2 with decreases in HCV RNA concentration indicate that the dose\u2010related changes in HCV RNA concentration were a result of HCV\u2010AbXTL68 administration in the 120\u2010 and 240\u2010mg groups. The overall incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was higher with placebo (60%) vs. all active treatments combined (42%). In conclusion, HCV\u2010AbXTL68 may decrease serum concentrations of HCV RNA in patients after liver transplantation. Studies evaluating more frequent daily dosing at doses >120 mg are necessary to investigate sustained viral suppression in this population. Liver Transpl 12:1381\u20131389. 2006. \u00a9 2006 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are present in Igs made from anti-HCV-positive plasma. However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412\u2013419 (epitope I) and 434\u2013446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.",

        "title": "Role of N-Linked Glycans in the Functions of Hepatitis C Virus Envelope Proteins Incorporated into Infectious Virions",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoproteins are highly glycosylated, with generally 4 and 11 N-linked glycans on E1 and E2, respectively. Studies using mutated recombinant HCV envelope glycoproteins incorporated into retroviral pseudoparticles (HCVpp) suggest that some glycans play a role in protein folding, virus entry, and protection against neutralization. The development of a cell culture system producing infectious particles (HCVcc) in hepatoma cells provides an opportunity to characterize the role of these glycans in the context of authentic infectious virions. Here, we used HCVcc in which point mutations were engineered at N-linked glycosylation sites to determine the role of these glycans in the functions of HCV envelope proteins. The mutants were characterized for their effects on virus replication and envelope protein expression as well as on viral particle secretion, infectivity, and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Our results indicate that several glycans play an important role in HCVcc assembly and/or infectivity. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that at least five glycans on E2 (denoted E2N1, E2N2, E2N4, E2N6, and E2N11) strongly reduce the sensitivity of HCVcc to antibody neutralization, with four of them surrounding the CD81 binding site. Altogether, these data indicate that the glycans associated with HCV envelope glycoproteins play roles at different steps of the viral life cycle. They also highlight differences in the effects of glycosylation mutations between the HCVpp and HCVcc systems. Furthermore, these carbohydrates form a \u201cglycan shield\u201d at the surface of the virion, which contributes to the evasion of HCV from the humoral immune response.",

        "abstract": "The majority of broadly neutralizing antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) are against conformational epitopes on the E2 glycoprotein. Many of them recognize overlapping epitopes in a cluster, designated as antigenic domain B, that contains residues G530 and D535. To gain information on other regions that will be relevant for vaccine design, we employed yeast surface display of antibodies that bound to genotype 1a H77C E2 mutant proteins containing a substitution either at Y632A (to avoid selecting non-neutralizing antibodies) or D535A. A panel of nine human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) was isolated and designated as HC-84-related antibodies. Each HMAb neutralized cell culture infectious HCV (HCVcc) with genotypes 1\u20136 envelope proteins with varying profiles, and each inhibited E2 binding to the viral receptor CD81. Five of these antibodies neutralized representative genotypes 1\u20136 HCVcc. Epitope mapping identified a cluster of overlapping epitopes that included nine contact residues in two E2 regions encompassing aa418\u2013446 and aa611\u2013616. Effect on virus entry was measured using H77C HCV retroviral pseudoparticles, HCVpp, bearing an alanine substitution at each of the contact residues. Seven of ten mutant HCVpp showed over 90% reduction compared to wild-type HCVpp and two others showed approximately 80% reduction. Interestingly, four of these antibodies bound to a linear E2 synthetic peptide encompassing aa434\u2013446. This region on E2 has been proposed to elicit non-neutralizing antibodies in humans that interfere with neutralizing antibodies directed at an adjacent E2 region from aa410\u2013425. The isolation of four HC-84 HMAbs binding to the peptide, aa434\u2013446, proves that some antibodies to this region are to highly conserved epitopes mediating broad virus neutralization. Indeed, when HCVcc were passaged in the presence of each of these antibodies, virus escape was not observed. Thus, the cluster of HC-84 epitopes, designated as antigenic domain D, is relevant for vaccine design for this highly diverse virus.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\u2002 HCV encodes two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which assemble as a non-covalent heterodimer in infected cells. During HCV morphogenesis, these proteins are incorporated into viral particles and they are the major viral determinants of HCV entry. Functional studies have revealed unique features in these viral envelope glycoproteins. Indeed, E1\u2013E2 interaction, mediated by their transmembrane domain, is essential for HCV assembly and entry. Furthermore, recent data also show that these glycoproteins interact with apolipoproteins. Recent crystallography data provide some structural support to better understand how these proteins interact with the host. In this review, we summarize the biogenesis of HCV envelope glycoproteins and their role in HCV morphogenesis in the context of the hijacking of the very low-density lipoprotein assembly pathway by this virus.

        "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 form a non-covalently linked heterodimer on the viral surface that mediates viral entry. E1, E2 and the heterodimer complex E1E2 are candidate vaccine antigens, but are technically challenging to study because of difficulties in producing natively folded proteins by standard protein expression and purification methods. To better comprehend the antigenicity of these proteins, a library of alanine scanning mutants comprising the entirety of E1E2 (555 residues) was created for evaluating the role of each residue in the glycoproteins. The mutant library was probed, by a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay, for binding with the co-receptor CD81, and a panel of 13 human and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target continuous and discontinuous epitopes of E1, E2, and the E1E2 complex. Together with the recently determined crystal structure of E2 core domain (E2c), we found that several residues in the E2 back layer region indirectly impact binding of CD81 and mAbs that target the conserved neutralizing face of E2. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the E2 back layer in interacting with the E2 front layer for its biological function. We also identified regions of E1 and E2 that likely located at or near the interface of the E1E2 complex, and determined that the E2 back layer also plays an important role in E1E2 complex formation. The conformation-dependent reactivity of CD81 and the antibody panel to the E1E2 mutant library provides a global view of the influence of each amino acid (aa) on E1E2 expression and folding. This information is valuable for guiding protein engineering efforts to enhance the antigenic properties and stability of E1E2 for vaccine antigen development and structural studies.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, more than 70 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. Despite the development of potent direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV treatment, a vaccine is urgently needed due to the high cost of treatment and the possibility of reinfection after cure. Induction of multiple broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target distinct epitopes on the HCV envelope proteins is one approach to vaccine development. However, antigenic sites targeted by bNAbs in individuals with spontaneous control of HCV have not been fully defined. In this study, we characterize 13 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from a single person who cleared an HCV infection without treatment, and we identify 3 new sites targeted by neutralizing antibodies. The sites targeted by these MAbs could inform HCV vaccine development. ABSTRACT Increasing evidence indicates that broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) play an important role in immune-mediated control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the relative contribution of neutralizing antibodies targeting antigenic sites across the HCV envelope (E1 and E2) proteins is unclear. Here, we isolated thirteen E1E2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from B cells of a single HCV-infected individual who cleared one genotype 1a infection and then became persistently infected with a second genotype 1a strain. These MAbs bound six distinct discontinuous antigenic sites on the E1 protein, the E2 protein, or the E1E2 heterodimer. Three antigenic sites, designated AS108, AS112 (an N-terminal E1 site), and AS146, were distinct from previously described antigenic regions (ARs) 1 to 5 and E1 sites. Antibodies targeting four sites (AR3, AR4-5, AS108, and AS146) were broadly neutralizing. These MAbs also displayed distinct patterns of relative neutralizing potency (i.e., neutralization profiles) across a panel of diverse HCV strains, which led to complementary neutralizing breadth when they were tested in combination. Overall, this study demonstrates that HCV bNAb epitopes are not restricted to previously described antigenic sites, expanding the number of sites that could be targeted for vaccine development. IMPORTANCE Worldwide, more than 70 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. Despite the development of potent direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV treatment, a vaccine is urgently needed due to the high cost of treatment and the possibility of reinfection after cure.

        "abstract": "Significance Hepatitis C virus infects 1% of the world\u2019s population, with no vaccine currently available. One vaccine candidate is the membrane-associated E1E2 envelope glycoprotein which has been used in clinical studies. However, a major challenge to both structural studies and rational vaccine design is high-yield production of homogenous E1E2. Production of E1E2 liberated from the membrane with native structure and antigenicity would thus represent a major advance. We describe the design and validation of a soluble, secreted E1E2 (sE1E2) antigen in which a scaffold replaces its transmembrane domains and enforces assembly. High-affinity sE1E2 binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies and to its receptor CD81, along with robust immunogenicity, makes this a promising platform for high-resolution structural characterization and vaccine development. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major worldwide health burden, and a preventive vaccine is needed for global control or eradication of this virus. A substantial hurdle to an effective HCV vaccine is the high variability of the virus, leading to immune escape. The E1E2 glycoprotein complex contains conserved epitopes and elicits neutralizing antibody responses, making it a primary target for HCV vaccine development. However, the E1E2 transmembrane domains that are critical for native assembly make it challenging to produce this complex in a homogenous soluble form that is reflective of its state on the viral envelope. To enable rational design of an E1E2 vaccine, as well as structural characterization efforts, we have designed a soluble, secreted form of E1E2 (sE1E2). As with soluble glycoprotein designs for other viruses, it incorporates a scaffold to enforce assembly in the absence of the transmembrane domains, along with a furin cleavage site to permit native-like heterodimerization. This sE1E2 was found to assemble into a form closer to its expected size than full-length E1E2. Preservation of native structural elements was confirmed by high-affinity binding to a panel of conformationally specific monoclonal antibodies, including two neutralizing antibodies specific to native E1E2 and to its primary receptor, CD81. Finally, sE1E2 was found to elicit robust neutralizing antibodies in vivo. This designed sE1E2 can both provide insights into the determinants of native E1E2 assembly and serve as a platform for production of E1E2 for future structural and vaccine studies, enabling rational optimization of an E1E2-based antigen.",
