        "title": "Long-term treatment of alcoholic liver disease with propylthiouracil.",
        "abstract": "Propylthiouracil has been shown experimentally to protect against alcohol-induced hepatocellular necrosis in hypoxic conditions. An earlier, short-term study of patients with alcoholism and liver disease indicated clinical improvement with propylthiouracil, but the effect on mortality could not be assessed. In the present study, we investigated the effect of propylthiouracil on mortality in patients with alcoholic liver disease in a long-term, double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 310 compliant patients who received propylthiouracil (n = 157) or placebo (n = 153) for a maximum of two years. There were no differences between the two groups in demographic and clinical characteristics and biopsy-confirmed diagnoses at randomization, or in daily urinary alcohol levels during the study. The cumulative dropout rate over two years was not significantly different (propylthiouracil group, 0.68; placebo group, 0.60). The group receiving propylthiouracil (300 mg per day) had a cumulative mortality rate half that in the group receiving placebo (0.13 vs. 0.25 [P less than 0.05] in the total sample, and 0.25 vs. 0.55 [P less than 0.03] in a subgroup of severely ill patients [propylthiouracil group, n = 56; placebo group, n = 41]). Proportional-hazards stepwise regression analyses indicated that only propylthiouracil treatment, prothrombin time, hemoglobin levels, and mean daily urinary alcohol levels significantly affected mortality. The hazards ratio for the complete group indicated that mortality in the propylthiouracil group was 0.38 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.83) that of the placebo group. Protection by propylthiouracil was not observed in patients with high morning urinary alcohol levels. No clinically important side effects of propylthiouracil were observed at the dose used. We conclude that the administration of propylthiouracil can reduce mortality due to alcoholic liver disease.",

        "abstract": "The basal energy production rate was measured using indirect calorimetry in 25 stable cirrhotic patients and 10 controls of comparable age. The endogenous substrate oxidation was also calculated by measuring urinary nitrogen excretion. The energy production rate was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls. The origins of liver disease and the degree of liver damage did not seem to influence the energy production rate. On the other hand, in cirrhotic patients, as in controls, a significant correlation was present between the energy production rate and parameters of body size, such as body weight and fat\u2010free mass. As a consequence, cirrhotic patients with poor nutritional status, with a reduced fat\u2010free mass, showed a lower energy production rate. The measured energy production rate was compared with the resting energy expenditure estimated by formulas commonly used in healthy individuals. The good agreement found between the measured energy production rate and calculated energy expenditure suggests that these formulas may be applied to stable cirrhotic patients in clinical practice. In cirrhotic patients, the oxidation of endogenous fat is the main contributor to basal energy production rate. The fat oxidation rate does not appear to be influenced by the hormonal pattern found in the cirrhotic patients. However, a significant correlation was present between fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid levels. This confirms that the prevalent fat use in cirrhotic patients is supported by the greater availability of fat\u2010derived substrates. (HEPATOLOGY 1990;12:106\u2013112).",

        "abstract": "Oral glucose tolerance was tested in a heterogeneous group of 108 patients with liver cirrhosis. Data were compared with those from 181 subjects without liver disease (44% normal, 35% impaired glucose tolerance and 21% type 2 diabetes mellitus). In cirrhosis, 27% of the patients had normal, 36% had impaired glucose tolerance, and 37% were diabetic. There was no association between glucose intolerance or diabetes and the aetiology of cirrhosis, the duration of the disease, the biochemical indicators of hepatocyte damage, cholestasis and/or liver function. Only weak associations were found between the results of quantitative liver functions tests (caffeine, xylocaine, indocyanine green) and basal and post load glucose and insulin concentrations. Cirrhotics with 1st degree relatives with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 16) did not show an increased prevalence of diabetes. Older and/or malnourished patients were more frequently glucose intolerant. Using the plasma glucose concentration 120 minutes after glucose load as the dependent variable, multivariate regression analysis showed that 54% of its variance is associated with the following variables: basal plasma glucose (36%) and free fatty acid concentration (5%), age (3%), basal glucose oxidation rate (3%), muscle mass (3%) and plasma free glycerol at 120 minutes after glucose load (3%). By contrast, the clinical state of the patients (i.e. the CHILD-Pugh score) accounted for only 2% of the variance. We conclude that glucose tolerance is variable in cirrhosis. After manifestation of liver disease, glucose intolerance or diabetes cannot be explained by the clinical, histological or biochemical signs of liver disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS Alterations in gluconeogenesis in the diseased liver can be assessed non-invasively using magnetic resonance spectroscopy by measuring changes in phosphomonoester resonance which contains information regarding several metabolites, including the phosphorylated intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway. METHODS 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine changes in phosphomonoesters following bolus infusions of 2.8 mmol/kgl-alanine in five patients with functionally compensated cirrhosis and in five patients with functionally decompensated cirrhosis. RESULTS Compared with six healthy volunteers, baseline phosphomonoester values were elevated by 35% (p<0.05) in the compensated cirrhosis group and by 57% (p<0.01) in the decompensated cirrhosis group. Following alanine infusion, phosphomonoesters in healthy volunteers increased by 46% from baseline values (p<0.01), in patients with compensated cirrhosis by 27% (p<0.02) but those with decompensated cirrhosis showed no increase from baseline. There was a reduction in the percentage of inorganic phosphate signal in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS By analysing changes in phosphomonoester and inorganic phosphate resonances it is possible to discern clear metabolic differences between healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis of varying severity using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Those patients with functionally decompensated cirrhosis have higher percentage baseline phosphomonoester values but the absence of phosphomonoester elevation following l-alanine infusion suggests that they are unable to mount a significant metabolic response with a progluconeogenic stimulus.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have examined the physiological/biochemical status of hepatocytes in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis in situ. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) is a noninvasive technique that permits direct assessments of tissue bioenergetics and phospholipid metabolism. Quantitative (31)P MRS was employed to document differences in the hepatic metabolite concentrations among patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis as well as healthy controls. All MRS examinations were performed on a 1.5-T General Electric Signa whole body scanner. The concentration of hepatic phosphorylated metabolites among patients with compensated cirrhosis (n = 7) was similar to that among healthy controls (n = 8). However, patients with decompensated cirrhosis (n = 6) had significantly lower levels of hepatic ATP compared with patients with compensated cirrhosis and healthy controls (P < 0.02 and P < 0.009, respectively) and a higher phosphomonoester/phosphodiester ratio than controls (P < 0.003). The results of this study indicate that metabolic disturbances in hepatic energy and phospholipid metabolism exist in patients with decompensated cirrhosis that are not present in patients with compensated cirrhosis or healthy controls. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hepatic decompensation.",

        "abstract": "Liver dysfunction correlates with alterations of intracellular concentrations of 31P metabolites. Localization and absolute quantification should help to trace regional hepatic metabolism. An improved protocol for the absolute quantification of 31P metabolites in vivo in human liver was developed by employing three\u2010dimensional (3D) k\u2010space weighted spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) with B1\u2010insensitive adiabatic excitation. The protocol allowed for high spatial resolution of 17.8 \u00b1 0.22 cm3 in 34 min at 3 T. No pulse adjustment prior to MRSI measurement was necessary due to adiabatic excitation. The protocol geometry was identical for all measurements so that one calibration data set, acquired from phantom replacement measurement, was applied for all quantifications. The protocol was tested in 10 young, healthy volunteers, for whom 57 \u00b1 7 spectra were quantified. Concentrations per liter of liver volume (reproducibilities) were 2.24 \u00b1 0.10 mmol/L (1.8%) for phosphomonoesters (PME), 1.37 \u00b1 0.07 mmol/L (7.9%) for inorganic phosphate (Pi), 11.40 \u00b1 0.96 mmol/L (2.9%) for phosphodiesters (PDE), and 2.14 \u00b1 0.10 mmol/L (1.6%) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), respectively. Taken together, this approach provides fast, simple, and reproducible high\u2010resolution absolute quantification and detailed mapping of the spatial distribution of hepatic 31P metabolites.

        "abstract": "Increased hepatocellular lipids relate to insulin resistance and are typical for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Steatosis and T2DM have been further associated with impaired muscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover indicating reduced mitochondrial fitness.

We measured hepatic lipid volume fraction (HLVF) and absolute concentrations of \u03b3ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters using noninvasive 1H/ 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in individuals with T2DM (58 \u00b1 6 years, 27 \u00b1 3 kg/m 2), and age\u2010matched and body mass index\u2013matched (mCON; 61 \u00b1 4 years, 26 \u00b1 4 kg/m 2) and young lean humans (yCON; 25 \u00b1 3 years, 22 \u00b1 2 kg/m 2, P < 0.005, P < 0.05 versus T2DM and mCON). Insulin\u2010mediated whole\u2010body glucose disposal (M) and endogenous glucose production (iEGP) were assessed during euglycemic\u2010hyperinsulinemic clamps. Individuals with T2DM had 26% and 23% lower \u03b3ATP (1.68 \u00b1 0.11; 2.26 \u00b1 0.20; 2.20 \u00b1 0.09 mmol/L; P < 0.05) than mCON and yCON individuals, respectively.

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a companion technique to the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Whereas MRI determines the spatial distribution of water (and lipid) protons across a region of interest, MRS measures the chemical content of MR-visible nuclei, which include the metabolically relevant elements of hydrogen (1H), carbon (13C), and phosphorus (31P). MRS is particularly advantageous for assessing metabolism because the chemical properties and environment of each nucleus determine the frequency at which it appears in the MR spectrum, giving rise to peaks corresponding not only to specific metabolites but also to the constituent nuclei of each metabolite (Fig. 1). It is therefore a multimodal, noninvasive technique capable of measuring a broad range of biological compounds across a variety of tissues. Repeated measures of metabolite content, metabolic fluxes, and their response to an intervention are possible, characteristics that make MRS ideally suited for in vivo studies of human metabolism. An additional advantage is that MRI scans can be obtained concurrently to provide structural/anatomical information that can guide data acquisition and assist in data analysis and interpretation. In this review, we will highlight some of the applications by which MRS can be used to investigate metabolism, focusing on its application to in vivo human studies.\n\n\n\nFIG. 1. \nMRS measures the chemical content of MR-visible nuclei across a region of interest and provides positional information as well as content.

However, the initiating organ of OXPHOS dysfunction during the development of systemic insulin resistance has yet to be identified. To determine whether adipose OXPHOS deficiency plays an etiological role in systemic insulin resistance, the metabolic phenotype of mice with OXPHOS\u2013deficient adipose tissue was examined. Crif1 is a protein required for the intramitochondrial production of mtDNA\u2013encoded OXPHOS subunits; therefore, Crif1 haploinsufficient deficiency in mice results in a mild, but specific, failure of OXPHOS capacity in vivo. Although adipose-specific Crif1-haploinsufficient mice showed normal growth and development, they became insulin-resistant. Crif1-silenced adipocytes showed higher expression of chemokines, the expression of which is dependent upon stress kinases and antioxidant. Accordingly, examination of adipose tissue from Crif1-haploinsufficient mice revealed increased secretion of MCP1 and TNF\u03b1, as well as marked infiltration by macrophages. These findings indicate that the OXPHOS status of adipose tissue determines its metabolic and inflammatory responses, and may cause systemic inflammation and insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of the hematopoietic microenvironment is the main obstacle encountered during hematopoiesis reconstruction in patients with acute hematopoietic radiation syndrome. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM\u2010MSCs) play a crucial supporting role in hematopoiesis by maintaining the balance between adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. In this study, we found that irradiation decreased the colony\u2010forming efficiency of BM\u2010MSCs and impaired the balance between adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Following irradiation, BM\u2010MCSs became strongly predisposed to adipogenesis, as evidenced by increased oil red O staining and elevated mRNA and protein levels of the adipogenic markers and transcription factors PPAR\u03b3 and AP2. Overexpression of the essential adipogenesis regulator Crif1 in BM\u2010MSCs promoted adipogenesis after irradiation exposure by upregulating adipogenesis\u2010related genes, including C/EBP\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3, and AP2. We found that Crif1 promoted the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) through direct interaction with protein kinase A (PKA)\u2010\u03b1. Phosphorylation of CREB was inhibited in Crif1\u2010knockdown BM\u2010MSCs even in the presence of a PKA agonist (db\u2010cAMP) and could be suppressed in Crif1\u2010overexpressing BM\u2010MSCs by a PKA\u03b1 inhibitor (H\u201089). These results suggest that Crif1 is an indispensable regulator of PKA\u03b1 cat that modulates the PKA/CREB signaling pathway to promote adipogenic differentiation of BM\u2010MSCs after irradiation.

        "abstract": "The high mortality associated with pancytopenia and multi-organ failure resulting from hematopoietic disorders of acute radiation syndrome (h-ARS) creates an urgent need for developing more effective treatment strategies. Here, we showed that bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) effectively regulate oxidative stress following radiative injury, which might be on account of irradiation-induced elevation of protein levels of CR6-interacting factor 1(CRIF1) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2(NRF2). Crif1-knockdown BMMSCs presented increased oxidative stress and apoptosis after irradiation, which were partially due to a suppressed antioxidant response mediated by decreased NRF2 nuclear translocation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments indicated that CRIF1 interacted with protein kinase C-\u03b4 (PKC-\u03b4). NRF2 Ser40 phosphorylation was inhibited in Crif1-deficient BMMSCs even in the presence of three kinds of PKC agonists, suggesting that CRIF1 might co-activate PKC-\u03b4 to phosphorylate NRF2 Ser40. After radiative injury, the supporting effect of BMMSCs for the colony forming ability of HSCs in vitro was reduced, and the deficiency of CRIF1 aggravated such damage. Thus, CRIF1 plays an essential role in PKC-\u03b4/NRF2 pathway modulation to alleviate oxidative stress in BMMSCs after irradiative injury, and at some level it may maintain the HSCs-supporting effect of BMMSCs after radiative injuries.",

The transcriptional factor Nrf2 is a master regulator in cellular and organismal defense against endogenous and exogenous stressors by coordinating basal and stress-inducible activation of multiple cytoprotective genes. The Nrf2 network not only tightly controls redox homeostasis but also regulates multiple intermediary metabolic processes. Therefore, targeting Nrf2 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of CNS diseases including stroke. Here, the current understanding of the Nrf2 regulatory network is critically examined to present evidence for the contribution of Nrf2 pathway in rodent ischemic stroke models. This review outlines the literature for Nrf2 studies in preclinical stroke and focuses on the in vivo evidence for the role of Nrf2 in primary and secondary brain injuries. The dynamic change and functional importance of Nrf2 signaling, as well as Nrf2 targeted intervention, are revealed in permanent, transient, and global cerebral ischemia models. In addition, key considerations, pitfalls, and future potentials for Nrf2 studies in preclinical stroke investigation are discussed.",

        "title": "Radiotherapy in the Management of Pediatric and Adult Osteosarcomas: A Multi-Institutional Cohort Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background: Due to the rarity of osteosarcoma and limited indications for radiotherapy (RT), data on RT for this tumor are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of RT for osteosarcomas in the recent 20 years and to identify factors related to patients\u2019 response to radiation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients irradiated for osteosarcoma treatment. We planned to assess differences in the utilization of RT between the periods of 2000\u20132010 and 2011\u20132020, identify the risk factors associated with local progression (LP), determine whether RT-related parameters are associated with LP, and calculate patients\u2019 survival. Results: A total of 126 patients with osteosarcoma who received 181 RT treatments were identified. We found a difference in RT techniques between RT performed in the years 2000\u20132010 and that performed in the years 2011\u20132020. LP was observed after 37 (20.4%) RT treatments. Intent of RT, distant metastases, and concomitant systemic treatment affected the risk of LP. Five-year overall survival was 33% (95% confidence interval (26%\u201343%)). Conclusions: RT for osteosarcoma treatment has evolved from simple two-dimensional palliative irradiation into more conformal RT applied for new indications including oligometastatic and oligoprogressive disease. RT may be a valuable treatment modality for selected patients with osteosarcoma.",

        "title": "Targeted alpha therapy with the 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 dual alpha solution in a multicellular tumor spheroid model of osteosarcoma",
        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma patients with overt metastases at primary diagnosis have a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. TP-3 is a murine IgG2b monoclonal antibody with high affinity for an epitope residing on the p80 osteosarcoma cell surface membrane antigen. The tumor-associated antigen p80 is overexpressed in osteosarcomas, and has very low normal tissue expression. We propose a novel dual alpha targeting solution containing two radionuclides from the same decay chain, including the bone-seeking 224Ra, and cancer cell-surface seeking 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for the treatment of osteoblastic bone cancers, circulating cancer cells and micrometastases. In this in vitro study, the cytotoxic effects of 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 (single alpha solution) and 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 (dual alpha solution) were investigated in a multicellular spheroid model mimicking micrometastatic disease in osteosarcoma. OHS spheroids with diameters of 253 \u00b1 98 \u03bcm treated with 4.5, 2.7, and 3.3 kBq/ml of 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for 1, 4, and 24 h, respectively, were disintegrated within 3 weeks. The 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 induced a 7-fold delay in spheroid doubling time compared to a 28-times higher dose with the non-specific 212Pb-TCMC-rituximab. The 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 completely disintegrated spheroids with diameters of 218\u2013476 \u03bcm within 3 and 2 weeks after 4 and 24 h incubation with 5 kBq/ml, respectively. Treatment with 1 kBq/ml of 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for 24 h caused an 11.4-fold reduction in spheroid viability compared with unconjugated 224Ra/212Pb. The single and dual alpha solutions with TP-3 showed cytotoxicity in spheroids of clinically relevant size, which warrant further testing of the dual alpha solution using in vivo osteosarcoma models.",

        "abstract": "The management of osteosarcoma (OS) patients presents a significant clinical challenge. Despite progress in conventional and targeted therapies, the survival rate of OS patients remains limited largely due to therapy resistance and the high metastatic potential of the disease. OS models that accurately reflect the fundamental characteristics are vital to the innovation and validation of effective therapies. This review provides an insight into the advances and challenges in OS drug development, focusing on various preclinical models, including cell lines, 3D culture models, murine models, and canine models. The relevance, strengths, and limitations of each model in OS research are explored. In particular, we highlight a range of potential therapeutics identified through these models. These instances of successful drug development represent promising pathways for personalized OS treatment.",

        "abstract": "The development of theranostic agents for radiopharmaceuticals based on therapeutic alpha emitters marks an important clinical need. We describe a strategy for the development of theranostic agents of this type via the functionalization of the ligand with the diagnostic radionuclide fluorine-18. An analogue of macropa, an 18-membered macrocyclic chelator with high affinity for alpha therapeutic radiometals, was synthesized and its complexation properties with metal ions were determined. The new macropa-F ligand was used for quantitative radiometal complexation with lead-203 and bismuth-207, as surrogates for their alpha-emitting radioisotopes. As a diagnostic partner, a radiofluorinated macropa ligand was used for quantitative bismuth(III) and lead(II) complexation. All fluorine-18 and radiometal complexes are highly stable in human serum over several days. This study presents a new proof-of-principle approach for developing theranostic agents based on alpha-emitting radionuclides and fluorine-18.",
