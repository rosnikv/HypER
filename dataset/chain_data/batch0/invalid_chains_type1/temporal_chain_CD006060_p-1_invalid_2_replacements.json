        "abstract": "Despite numerous studies on women's cardiac health throughout the past decade, the number of female deaths caused by cardiovascular disease still rises and remains the leading cause of death in women in most areas of the world. Novel studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease, and more specifically coronary artery disease presentations in women, are different than those in men. In addition, pathology and pathophysiology of the disease present significant gender differences, which leads to difficulties concerning diagnosis, treatment and outcome of the female population. The reason for this disparity is all steps for female cardiovascular disease evaluation, treatment and prevention are not well elucidated; and an area for future research. This review brings together the most recent studies published in the field of coronary artery disease in women and points out new directions for future investigation on some of the important issues.",

        "title": "Why insulin sensitizers but not secretagogues should be retained when initiating insulin in type 2 diabetes",
        "abstract": "The stringent targets set for HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes are currently achieved by fewer than half the patients in the United States. Failure to manage hyperglycaemia in the early stages of disease results in progressive loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function, which ultimately necessitates the initiation of insulin therapy. At this point, choices have to be made on whether to continue oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy and, if so, with which agent(s). Historically, sulfonylureas have been the mainstay of oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy; however, their long\u2010term efficacy in patients with depleted \u03b2\u2010cell capacity is doubtful, and other classes of oral anti\u2010diabetic drugs, notably the insulin sensitizers, may prove more reliable. These agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones) appear to provide various benefits over and above sustained glycaemic control, which may variably include reduced loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function as well as improvements to cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Metformin also limits weight gain associated with insulin therapy. This manuscript presents the case that when insulin therapy is initiated it should be tailored to individual needs through combination with one or more insulin sensitizers rather than a secretagogue.

        "abstract": "We compared the combined use of basal insulin, metformin and insulin secretagogues with a combination of basal insulin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes starting basal insulin analogue therapy. This analysis was part of a 24\u2010week trial, in which 964 insulin\u2010naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral agents (including metformin) were randomized to insulin glargine or detemir. Secretagogues were stopped or maintained at the site\u2010investigators' discretion. During the study, 57.6% of patients continued their secretagogue treatment. Compared with patients stopping secretagogues, those who continued experienced significantly more hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower: 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 versus 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 U/kg/day (p < 0.001). The difference between groups in mean HbA1c reduction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic patients starting basal insulin analogue therapy, continuing both metformin and secretagogues results in more hypoglycaemia and weight gain and lower insulin doses than only maintaining metformin.",

Almost all existing trials have been designed to investigate changes in glycemic control and not differences in hypoglycemia events. In this review, we present an overview of the hypoglycemic data available from the randomized controlled trials comparing insulin glargine and insulin detemir with NPH or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The limited head-to-head glargine versus detemir data are also discussed with comments on early results relating to the newer insulin analog, degludec. Basal insulin analogs are associated with reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Most studies have excluded participants with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia or previous severe events, however, and hypoglycemia reporting is variable and inconsistent. This limits interpretation for those with long-duration type 1 diabetes, and particularly impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, or long-duration more insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes. New optimally designed studies are required to elucidate the true impact of basal analogs on hypoglycemia burden in those living with long-term insulin therapy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultralong duration of action, and a rapid-acting insulin in a single injection. This trial compared IDegAsp with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with once- or twice-daily (OD or BID) pre- or self-mixed insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 26-week, randomized, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target trial, participants (mean age 58.7 years, duration of diabetes 13 years, BMI 29.3 kg/m2, and HbA1c 8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) were exposed (1:1) to BID injections of IDegAsp (n = 224) or BIAsp 30 (n = 222), administered with breakfast and the main evening meal and dose titrated to a self-measured premeal plasma glucose (PG) target of 4.0\u20135.0 mmol/L. RESULTS After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c was 7.1% (54 mmol/mol) for both groups, with IDegAsp achieving the prespecified noninferiority margin for mean change in HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] \u20130.03% points [95% CI \u20130.18 to 0.13]). Treatment with IDegAsp was superior in lowering fasting PG (ETD \u20131.14 mmol/L [95% CI \u20131.53 to \u20130.76], P < 0.001) and had a significantly lower final mean daily insulin dose (estimated rate ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.83\u20130.96], P = 0.002). Fewer confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemia episodes were reported for IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30. CONCLUSIONS IDegAsp BID effectively improves HbA1c and fasting PG levels with fewer hypoglycemia episodes versus BIAsp 30 in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes previously treated with once- or twice-daily pre- or self-mixed insulin.",

A 12-week multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study was performed in 52 subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized to once-daily IDegAsp (n = 26) or basal insulin (n = 26). The primary endpoint was percent change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Furthermore, it was analyzed post hoc in subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c. During a follow-up period, percent change in HbA1c was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.161). Daily insulin doses and frequency of overall hypoglycemia were also similar in the two groups. In post hoc analyses, once-daily basal insulin was more effective than IDegAsp in subjects with HbA1c more than or equal to 8.5% (p < 0.05); however, in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant improvement in percent change in HbA1c at week 12, compared with basal insulin (p < 0.01). Although there was no apparent difference in the HbA1c-lowering effects between two groups, when compared in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant effect in comparison with once-daily basal insulin.

The present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of IDegAsp compared with a conventional premixed insulin or basal insulin. We extracted data from citation databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, since inception to 2021. We calculated the mean differences for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), self-measured mean glucose, and postprandial glucose (PPG) and odds ratios for confirmed hypoglycemia events. Compared with twice-daily conventional premixed insulin, twice-daily IDegAsp showed a similar effect on changes in HbA1c, but it significantly reduced FPG and self-measured mean glucose levels. Furthermore, compared to once-daily basal insulin, once-daily IDegAsp had a similar effect on changes in HbA1c, but it significantly reduced self-measured mean glucose and PPG levels. The risk of overall confirmed hypoglycemia was similar between treatments; however, the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia events was significantly lower with IDegAsp than with conventional premixed insulin and basal insulin. Thus, IDegAsp was more effective than conventional premixed insulin and basal insulin at reducing blood glucose with fewer nocturnal hypoglycemia events.",
