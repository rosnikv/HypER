        "title": "Radiographic, clinical, and functional outcomes of treatment with adalimumab (a human anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving concomitant methotrexate therapy: a randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that mediates inflammatory synovitis and articular matrix degradation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the ability of adalimumab, a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, to inhibit the progression of structural joint damage, reduce the signs and symptoms, and improve physical function in patients with active RA receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 619 patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week (n = 207), adalimumab 20 mg subcutaneously every week (n = 212), or placebo (n = 200) plus concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy end points were radiographic progression at week 52 (total Sharp score by a modified method [TSS]), clinical response at week 24 (improvements of at least 20% in the American College of Rheumatology core criteria [ACR20]), and physical function at week 52 (disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 52, there was statistically significantly less radiographic progression, as measured by the change in TSS, in the patients receiving adalimumab either 40 mg every other week (mean +/- SD change 0.1 +/- 4.8) or 20 mg weekly (0.8 +/- 4.9) as compared with that in the placebo group (2.7 +/- 6.8) (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). In addition, there were statistically significant changes in the components of the TSS. At week 24, ACR20 responses were achieved by 63% and 61% of patients in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly groups, respectively, versus 30% of patients in the placebo group (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, ACR20 responses were achieved by 59% and 55% of patients taking adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly, respectively, versus 24% of patients taking placebo (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, physical function as measured by the HAQ demonstrated statistically significant improvement with adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly compared with placebo (mean change in HAQ score -0.59 and -0.61, respectively, versus -0.25; P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). A total of 467 patients (75.4%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated. Discontinuations occurred in 22.0% of adalimumab-treated patients and in 30.0% of placebo-treated patients. The rate of adverse events (both serious and nonserious) was comparable in the adalimumab and placebo groups, although the proportion of patients reporting serious infections was higher in patients receiving adalimumab (3.8%) than in those receiving placebo (0.5%) (P < or = 0.02), and was highest in the patients receiving 40 mg every other week.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this 52-week trial, adalimumab was more effective than placebo at inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage, reducing the signs and symptoms, and improving physical function in patients with active RA who had demonstrated an incomplete response to MTX.",

        "title": "A systematic review of the effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults and an economic evaluation of their cost-effectiveness.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis report reviews the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, agents that inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases were searched up to February 2005.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nSystematic reviews of the literature on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were undertaken and industry submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) were reviewed. Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. Etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage. Etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. Infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality.",

        "title": "The Comparative Safety and Effectiveness of TNF-alpha Antagonists",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the current knowledge on safety and effectiveness of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a antagonists and identify current knowledge/evidence gaps for study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Effective Health Care Program. BACKGROUND: Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) and the Developing Evidence to Inform Decisions about Effectiveness (DEcIDE) network of AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program will study the safety and effectiveness of biologic and nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (e.g., TNF-a antagonists). The current knowledge of safety and effectiveness of TNF-a antagonists is reviewed. SUMMARY: Treatment of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves determining which agents are safe, effective, and cost effective for an individual. Each individual patient's health system may also play a role in which agents are chosen. Many agents are available for the management of RA, some with high cost and unknown safety. Section 1013 of the Medicare ModernizationAct of 2003 authorizes AHRQ to study comparative effectiveness and safety ofRA treatments through both EPCs and DEcIDE centers to develop scientific knowledge for RA management as well as through epidemiologic studies.Results will be compiled through a Clinical Decisions and CommunicationsScience Center, then disseminated to all appropriate stakeholders, including patients, payers, and health care professionals. The current knowledge of safety and effectiveness of TNF-a antagonists in the treatment of RA is reviewed. Increased rates of serious infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), or tuberculosis reactivation, may occur with the use ofTNF-a antagonists. It is still unclear if RA increases the risk of developing cancer, or if use of TNF-a antagonists increases cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-a antagonists are costly, yet effective treatments for early and late RA. Use of these agents provides rapid relief of RA symptoms and provides positive outcomes, defined as improvements in AmericanCollege of Rheumatology 20, 50, 70 scores; Health Assessment Questionnaire ratings; activities of daily living; joint space narrowing; erosions; and acute phase reactants. Reactivation of latent MTB or onset of other infections or cancers may occur in RA patients with TNF-a antagonists.",

        "title": "Systematic Review: Comparative Effectiveness and Harms of Disease-Modifying Medications for Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Context Which disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) best reduce symptoms, improve function, and prevent radiographic progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Contribution This systematic review of trials that compared DMARDs in adults with rheumatoid arthritis found few direct comparisons of different agents but no important differences among synthetic DMARDs or antitumor necrosis factor drugs. Combination therapy improved response rates and functional outcomes in patients whose monotherapy failed. Numbers and types of short-term adverse events were similar among DMARDs. Implication Of several monotherapies for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, no regimen is clearly superior. Combination therapies improve response rates in some patients previously receiving monotherapy. The Editors Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects more than 2 million adults in the United States. Disease onset generally occurs between 30 and 55 years of age, and women are affected more often than men. Disease hallmarks are inflammation of the synovium, progressive bone erosion, joint malalignment and destruction, and subsequent weakness of surrounding tissues and muscles. Presentations range from mild to severe, although the typical patient has a progressive course leading to functional limitations. Treatment aims at controlling pain and inflammation and slowing or arresting the progression of joint destruction. Therapies generally used in the United States include corticosteroids; synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine; and biological DMARDs, such as abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, etanercept, infliximab, and rituximab. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends beginning DMARD therapy within 3 months of diagnosis (1). Often, treatment with a single DMARD does not adequately control symptoms, leading clinicians to consider various combination strategies. Experts do not agree about the comparative benefits of different combination therapies. Many questions remain about the risks of these agents across a spectrum of adverse events from relatively minor side effects to severe and possibly life-threatening problems. Given this uncertainty, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned a systematic review to compare the benefits and safety of rheumatoid arthritis drugs (2). Methods We developed and followed a standardized protocol for all steps of the review. The full technical report (2) describes study methods in detail and gives evidence tables of individual studies. Literature Search We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts for studies from 1980 to September 2007. Search terms included Medical Subject Headings or keywords when appropriate. We combined terms for rheumatoid arthritis with 11 drugs of interest (corticosteroid, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, abatacept, anakinra, and rituximab). We limited electronic searches to studies involving adults and humans and studies in English. We manually searched reference lists of review articles and letters to the editor. In addition, we searched the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research database (September 2007) to identify unpublished research submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In early to mid-2006, the Oregon Scientific Resource Center invited pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit dossiers on all published and unpublished studies on a specific drug. Five companies (Abbott, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Centocor, and Genentech) provided dossiers. Study Selection Two persons, each blinded to the other's results, independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and sometimes full text to identify studies meeting preestablished criteria. To assess efficacy regarding symptoms, quality of life, functional capacity, and radiographic progression, we included head-to-head controlled trials and prospective cohort studies comparing any of the therapies. For harms (specific adverse events, rates of adverse events, and discontinuation attributable to adverse events) and subgroups, we also examined data from retrospective observational studies and placebo-controlled trials. For efficacy and harm data, we selected studies with 100 or more participants and at least 12 weeks of follow-up. Finally, if we found no evidence about efficacy from direct head-to-head comparison studies, we included evidence from fair- or good-quality meta-analyses that indirectly compared placebo-controlled trial data across drugs. Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment Trained reviewers abstracted each study by using a Web-based system (SRS 4.0, TrialStat, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). A senior reviewer read each abstracted article and evaluated completeness of data extraction. We recorded intention-to-treat results if available. We assessed the internal validity (quality) of trials on the basis of predefined criteria from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (rating of good, fair, or poor) (3) and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (4). Elements of internal validity for trials included randomization, allocation concealment, similarity of compared groups at baseline, intention-to-treat analysis, and overall and differential loss to follow-up. To assess the quality of observational studies, we used criteria outlined by Deeks and colleagues (5). Items assessed included sample selection, adjustment for confounders, methods of outcomes assessment, length of follow-up, and statistical analysis. Data Synthesis We primarily synthesized the literature qualitatively; we reported some quantitative syntheses from fair- to good-quality meta-analyses. Drug comparisons that were not quantitatively analyzed in meta-analyses had insufficient data or noncomparable study samples and did not merit additional quantitative analyses. We examined data within 3 main drug classes (corticosteroids, synthetic DMARDs, and biological DMARDs) and between drug classes and combination therapies. Strength of Evidence Ratings We rated the strength of the available evidence in a 3-part hierarchy (high, moderate, and low) (2) based on a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach (6, 7). Grades reflect the strength of evidence for a given comparison with respect to specific outcomes, such as 20% improvement in ACR response criteria (ACR 20), radiographic changes, or adverse events. Role of the Funding Source Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality staff participated in formulating initial study questions and reviewed methods, data analysis, and the draft report. The funding source did not participate in the literature search, determination of study eligibility, or evaluation of individual studies. Results Characteristics of Reviewed Studies We identified 2395 citations (Figure). Working from 635 articles retrieved for full review, we included 143 published articles reporting on 101 studies (Table 1). Of the 101 included studies, 49 (48.5%) were supported by pharmaceutical companies, 20 (19.8%) by governmental or independent funds, and 11 (10.9%) by a combination of pharmaceutical and governmental funding. We could not determine the source of support for 21 (20.8%) studies. Table 1. Summary of Head-to-Head Reviewed Studies, by Drug Comparison* Figure. Study flow diagram. Numbers of included articles and included studies differ because some studies have multiple publications. RCT = randomized, controlled trial. Comparative Effectiveness and Harms We found few fair- or good-quality head-to-head trials for each drug comparison (Table 1). Most trials were efficacy trials in highly selected populations with few comorbid conditions. Most trials used ACR 20, disease activity scores to measure clinical improvement, and Sharp or Sharpvan der Heijde scores to measure radiologic progression of the disease. Trials examining quality of life used the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) or Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). Table 2 summarizes results. Table 2. Summary of Comparative Findings on Efficacy and Harms of Rheumatoid Arthritis Drugs Monotherapy versus Monotherapy Synthetic DMARDs One good systematic review that included a meta-analysis of 2 trials suggested that more patients receiving methotrexate achieved ACR 20 at 1 year than did patients receiving leflunomide (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.15 to 1.77]). The ACR 20 benefit was lower and more uncertain at 2 years (odds ratio, 1.28 [CI, 0.98 to 1.67]) (8). However, patients receiving methotrexate showed less improvement in health-related quality of life than did patients receiving leflunomide (odds ratio for SF-36 physical component, 3.00 [CI, 5.41 to 0.59]). Radiographic outcomes over 2 years seemed similar. For leflunomide versus sulfasalazine, data are limited to 1 trial (9) involving 358 participants with 2-year follow-up (10, 11). Leflunomide yielded more patients achieving ACR 20, ACR 50, and greater improvement in functional capacity (ACR 20, 82% vs. 60% [P= 0.008]; ACR 50, 52% vs. 25% [P= 0.040]; HAQ, 0.50 vs. 0.29 [P 0.030]). Radiographic changes were similar for the 2 drugs (Larsen score change at 2 years, 0.010 for either drug) (9). Three trials involving 479 participants and lasting up to 52 weeks compared methotrexate with sulfasalazine and found similar response rates in ACR 20, disease activity scores, or functional capacity (1214). Two trials included patients with disease for longer than 1 year and used a lower dose of weekly methotrexate (7.5 mg) than that generally used in the United States (13, 14). The overall attrition rate for these studies ranged from 19% to 28.5%. We found no statistically significant differences in frequency of serious adverse events for leflunomide, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine in 3 efficacy trial",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the association of methotrexate (MTX) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists with the risk of infectious outcomes including opportunistic infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Patients with RA enrolled in the Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA) registry prescribed MTX, TNF antagonists or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were included. The primary outcomes were incident overall and opportunistic infections. Incident rate ratios were calculated using generalised estimating equation Poisson regression models adjusted for demographics, comorbidities and RA disease activity measures. Results: A total of 7971 patients with RA were followed. The adjusted rate of infections per 100 person-years was increased among users of MTX (30.9, 95% CI 29.2 to 32.7), TNF antagonists (40.1, 95% CI 37.0 to 43.4) and a combination of MTX and TNF antagonists (37.1, 95% CI 34.9 to 39.3) compared with users of other non-biological DMARDs (24.5, 95% CI 21.8 to 27.5). The adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) was increased in patients treated with MTX (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.50) and TNF antagonists (IRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.78) compared with those treated with other DMARDs. TNF antagonist use was associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections (IRR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.94). Prednisone use was associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections (IRR 1.63, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.21) and an increased risk of overall infection at doses >10 mg daily (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53). Conclusions: MTX, TNF antagonists and prednisone at doses >10 mg daily were associated with increased risks of overall infections. Low-dose prednisone and TNF antagonists (but not MTX) increased the risk of opportunistic infections.",

        "title": "The risk of infections associated with rheumatoid arthritis, with its comorbidity and treatment.",
        "abstract": "RA is known to be associated with an increased risk of serious infection. Even more than 50 years ago, observational studies showed a greater than 2-fold increased risk of serious infection in RA. This was reinforced by various subsequent cohort studies. The elevated susceptibility of patients with RA can be explained by the pathobiology of the disease itself, the impact of chronic comorbid conditions, as well as sequelae of immunosuppressive treatment. It has been suggested that premature ageing of the immune system in RA contributes to weakened protection against infectious organisms. In addition, chronic comorbid conditions such as diabetes or chronic lung or kidney disease, disease-related functional disability, as well as lifestyle factors such as smoking, increase the risk in individual patients. For a long time glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used as potent immunosuppressive drugs in RA. There is evidence that they increase the risk of serious infections up to 4-fold in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors increase the serious infection risk up to 2-fold. They have, however, the potential to outweigh their risk when higher GC doses can be tapered down. If patients need higher dosages of GCs in addition to treatment with biologic agents, their risk of infection is substantial. This combination should be used carefully and, if possible, avoided in patients with additional risk factors such as older age or comorbid conditions.",

Methods We conducted two studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23) and the 2011\u20132012 trivalent influenza vaccine. In study A, tofacitinib-naive patients were randomised to tofacitinib 10\u2005mg twice daily or placebo, stratified by background methotrexate and vaccinated 4\u2005weeks later. In study B, patients already receiving tofacitinib 10\u2005mg twice daily (with or without methotrexate) were randomised into two groups: those continuing (\u2018continuous\u2019) or interrupting (\u2018withdrawn\u2019) tofacitinib for 2\u2005weeks, and then vaccinated 1\u2005week after randomisation. In both studies, titres were measured 35\u2005days after vaccination. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving a satisfactory response to pneumococcus (twofold or more titre increase against six or more of 12 pneumococcal serotypes) and influenza (fourfold or more titre increase against two or more of three influenza antigens). Results In study A (N=200), fewer tofacitinib patients (45.1%) developed satisfactory pneumococcal responses versus placebo (68.4%), and pneumococcal titres were lower with tofacitinib (particularly with methotrexate). Similar proportions of tofacitinib-treated and placebo-treated patients developed satisfactory influenza responses (56.9% and 62.2%, respectively), although fewer tofacitinib patients (76.5%) developed protective influenza titres (\u22651:40 in two or more of three antigens) versus placebo (91.8%). In study B (N=183), similar proportions of continuous and withdrawn patients had satisfactory responses to PPSV-23 (75.0% and 84.6%, respectively) and influenza (66.3% and 63.7%, respectively). Conclusions Among patients starting tofacitinib, diminished responsiveness to PPSV-23, but not influenza, was observed, particularly in those taking concomitant methotrexate. Among existing tofacitinib users, temporary drug discontinuation had limited effect upon influenza or PPSV-23 vaccine responses. Trial registration numbers NCT01359150, NCT00413699.",

        "title": "Vaccination Recommendations for Adults With Autoimmune Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases in Latin America",
        "abstract": "Background/Objective Patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) are at increased risk of contracting severe infections and suffering complications, particularly when they are receiving immunomodulating therapy. Vaccination is an important means to prevent many potential infections and thereby reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with AIRD. The purpose of this consensus document is to provide health care professionals with recommendations for the vaccination of AIRD patients who reside in Latin America. The recommendations were developed by an expert committee from the region based on a review of the literature and their clinical experience. Methods The Americas Health Foundation (AHF) used PubMed and EMBASE to identify clinicians and scientists with an academic or hospital affiliation and who had published in the field of adult vaccination and rheumatic diseases since 2010. As a result of this effort, AHF convened an 8-member panel of clinical and scientific experts from Latin America. Both the AHF and panel members conducted a careful literature review to identify relevant publications in the areas of adult vaccination and rheumatology, and the sum of the articles identified was provided to the entire panel. Prior to the conference, panelists were each asked to prepare a written response to a salient issue on the subject, identified by AHF. Results and Conclusions During the conference, each response was edited by the entire group, through numerous drafts and rounds of discussion until a complete consensus on vaccination recommendations for adult patients with AIRDs was obtained, including 7 key recommendations.",

        "title": "Optimal time between the last methotrexate administration and seasonal influenza vaccination in rheumatoid arthritis: post hoc analysis of a randomised clinical trial",
        "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX), a mainstay treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), suppresses immune responses to influenza vaccination by approximately 15%\u201320%.1 To improve responses, MTX can be stopped or a higher dose of influenza antigen can be administered. A pilot study showed that holding MTX for 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after vaccination, or for 4 weeks after vaccination reversed MTX-induced suppression of vaccine responses, but with a tendency to increasing RA flare.2 A subsequent randomised clinical trial (RCT) showed that discontinuing MTX temporarily for 2 weeks after vaccination improved vaccine responses to an extent similar to those after discontinuation of MTX for 4 weeks, with no increase in RA disease activity.3 In the latter trial, patients skipped two doses of MTX after vaccination. Since levels of MTX in blood fall after the last dose, the time between the last MTX dose and vaccination may influence vaccine responses. Here, we examined clinical factors associated with improved vaccine responses after MTX discontinuation.\n\nThis is a post hoc analysis of the RCT that investigated the effect of MTX discontinuation for 2 weeks on responses to seasonal influenza vaccination.3 Briefly, 316 patients with RA \u2026",

        "title": "COVID-19 vaccination and antirheumatic therapy",
        "abstract": "Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination will be the largest vaccination programme in the history of the NHS. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy will be among the earliest to be vaccinated. Some evidence indicates immunosuppressive therapy inhibits humoral response to the influenza, pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The degree to which this will translate to impaired COVID-19 vaccine responses is unclear. Other evidence suggests withholding MTX for 2 weeks post-vaccination may improve responses. Rituximab has been shown to impair humoral responses for 6\u2009months or longer post-administration. Decisions on withholding or interrupting immunosuppressive therapy around COVID-19 vaccination will need to be made prior to the availability of data on specific COVID-19 vaccine response in these patients. With this in mind, this article outlines the existing data on the effect of antirheumatic therapy on vaccine responses in patients with inflammatory arthritis and formulates a possible pragmatic management strategy for COVID-19 vaccination.",

It mentions methotrexate as a treatment that can impair vaccine responses, which is related to the source paper's finding that methotrexate can suppress immune responses to influenza vaccination. The paper also suggests withholding methotrexate for 2 weeks post-vaccination to improve responses, which is similar to the source paper's investigation of the optimal time between the last methotrexate administration and seasonal influenza vaccination."

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every sphere of life including management of psoriasis. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines has given rise to hope and at the same time some apprehensions as well. With the general population becoming eligible for vaccination, there is some confusion, on the eligibility of patients with different medical conditions and patients on immunosuppressive or immunomodulating medications for COVID-19 vaccination. Dermatologists treating psoriasis patients frequently face questions from them, whether they can undergo coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. A PUBMED search was performed using the following strategy: 'COVID-19' AND 'Vaccine' AND 'Psoriasis'. We also performed a PUBMED search using the following strategy: 'SARS-CoV-2' AND 'Vaccine' AND 'Psoriasis'. All articles irrespective of language and publication date were included to arrive at this position statement. This position statement deals with the safety, eligibility and modifications of treatment, if needed among psoriasis patients with regards to the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines currently available in India.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the long-term impact of immunosuppressive therapeutic agents on antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccination in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) in order to propose a strategy for annual vaccination.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis prospective multicentre cohort study evaluated the humoral response to second and third BNT162b2 and/or mRNA-1273 vaccines in 382 Japanese AIRD patients classified into 12 different medication groups and in 326 healthy controls (HCs). The third vaccination was administered six months after the second vaccination. Antibody titres were measured using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2\u2009S assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe seroconversion rate and antibody titres were lower in AIRD patients than in HCs 3-6\u2009weeks after the second vaccination and 3-6\u2009weeks after the third vaccination. Seroconversion rates were <90% after the third vaccination in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab. A multivariate analysis was conducted, adjusting for age, sex, and glucocorticoid dosage. Antibody levels after the third vaccination were significantly lower in the groups prescribed tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor with or without methotrexate, abatacept and rituximab or cyclophosphamide than those of HCs. The third vaccination induced an adequate humoral response in patients treated with sulfasalazine, bucillamine, methotrexate monotherapy, iguratimod, interleukin-6 inhibitors or calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRepeated vaccinations in many immunosuppressed patients produced antibody responses similar to those observed in HCs. In contrast, annual vaccination in patients receiving TNF inhibitors, abatacept, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab may require caution.",
