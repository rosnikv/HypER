        "title": "A randomized study of adefovir dipivoxil in place of HBIG in combination with lamivudine as post\u2013liver transplantation hepatitis B prophylaxis",
        "abstract": "Prior to effective prophylaxis, liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)\u2010related disease was frequently complicated by recurrence, which could be severe and rapidly progressive. Combination hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and lamivudine prophylaxis reduces this rate of recurrence to <5% at 5 years; however, HBIG administration is costly and inconvenient. We conducted a multicenter randomized study of adefovir dipivoxil substitution for low\u2010dose intramuscular (IM) HBIG in patients without HBV recurrence at least 12 months posttransplantation for HBV\u2010related disease. Thirty\u2010four patients were randomized, 16 to adefovir (1 patient withdrew consent at 3 months and is not considered in the results) and 18 to continue HBIG. All continued lamivudine. Groups were well matched by age, sex, and time since transplantation (median, 4.5 years), and background virological risk for HBV recurrence (30% of patients in the adefovir group, 24% in the HBIG group having detectable HBV DNA at transplantation). All patients were alive at study completion without recurrence. One patient in the adefovir group became hepatitis B surface antigen\u2013positive at 5 months but was persistently HBV DNA undetectable via polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 14 IU/mL) over the following 20 months. Median creatinine was not significantly changed over the course of the study in either group. One patient in the adefovir group with a background of diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy (baseline creatinine 150 \u03bcmol/L) developed increased creatinine leading to dose reduction and ultimately cessation of adefovir at 15 months. Yearly cost of combination adefovir/lamivudine prophylaxis was $8,290 versus $13,718 IM HBIG/lamivudine. Conclusion: Compared with combination HBIG plus lamivudine prophylaxis, combination adefovir plus lamivudine provides equivalent protection against recurrent HBV infection but with better tolerability and less cost.

        "title": "Current management of hepatitis B virus infection before and after liver transplantation",
        "abstract": "The progress in treatment against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has substantially improved the outcome of all HBV\u2010infected patients. We systematically reviewed the existing data in the management of HBV transplant patients in order to assess the optimal regimen in the pretransplant setting, for post\u2010transplant prophylaxis and for therapy of HBV recurrent infection. All data suggest that an effective pretransplant anti\u2010HBV therapy prevents post\u2010transplant HBV recurrence. Pretransplant therapy has been based on lamivudine with addition of adefovir upon lamivudine resistance, but the use of newer, potent high\u2010genetic barrier agents is expected to improve long\u2010term efficacy. Moreover, it may lead to improvement of liver function, which sometimes removes the need for transplantation, although more objective criteria for removal from waiting lists are required. After liver transplantation, the combination of HBV immunoglobulin and one nucleos(t)ide analogue, mostly lamivudine, is currently the best approach, almost eliminating the probability of HBV recurrence. Treatment of post\u2010transplant HBV recurrence has been mainly studied with lamivudine, but it will be most effective with entecavir and tenofovir, which have a low risk of resistance. In conclusion, the newer anti\u2010HBV agents improve the treatment of HBV both pretransplant and post\u2010transplant. HBV immunoglobulin is still used in combination with an anti\u2010HBV agent for post\u2010transplant prophylaxis. Monoprophylaxis with one of the new anti\u2010HBV agents might be possible, particularly in patients preselected as having a low risk of HBV recurrence, but further data are needed and strategies to ensure compliance must be used.",

        "title": "Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues for prophylaxis against hepatitis b virus recurrence after liver transplantation: A systematic review",
        "abstract": "A combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) is currently recommended as prophylaxis against the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (LT), but the optimal protocol is a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was the identification of factors associated with post\u2010LT HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and NUCs. We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies in English about the effectiveness of HBIG and NUCs [lamivudine (LAM) and/or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)] against post\u2010LT HBV recurrence (January 1998 to June 2010). Forty\u2010six studies, which included 2162 HBV LT recipients, met the selection criteria. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM experienced HBV recurrence more frequently than patients receiving HBIG and ADV with or without LAM [6.1% (115/1889) versus 2.0% (3/152), P = 0.024], although they also were more frequently treated with indefinite HBIG prophylaxis (90% versus 57%, P < 0.001). For patients receiving HBIG and LAM, a lower frequency of HBV recurrence was associated with a high HBIG dosage (\u226510,000 IU/day) versus a low HBIG dosage (<10,000 IU/day) during the first week after LT [3.2% (14/440) versus 6.5% (80/1233), P = 0.016], but the HBIG protocol had no impact on HBV recurrence in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. In conclusion, in comparison with the combination of HBIG and LAM, the combination of HBIG and ADV is associated with a lower rate of HBV recurrence after LT. Patients receiving HBIG and LAM should be given a high dosage of HBIG during the first week after LT, but a lower dosage can be used safely in patients receiving HBIG and ADV. Further studies with newer and more potent anti\u2010HBV agents are definitely required. Liver Transpl 17:1176\u20131190, 2011. \u00a9 2011 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "Background Hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HCC are the main indications for liver transplantation. We compared differences in survival outcomes between these two conditions. Methods and Findings The China Liver Transplant Registry (CLTR) contains data collated from all transplants performed in 86 liver transplantation centers across China. We analyzed CLTR data from January 1999 to December 2010. In all, 7,658 patients (7,162 with HBV-HCC and 496 with HCV-HCC) were included in this study. Clinical characteristics were compared between the HBV-HCC and HCV-HCC groups; Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to calculate the overall, tumor-free and hepatitis-free survival rates. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival was significantly higher in HBV-HCC recipients than in HCV-HCC recipients (76.65%, 56.61% and 49.10% vs. 64.59%, 42.78% and 39.20%, respectively; P<0.001). The corresponding tumor-free survival rates (63.55%, 47.37%, 40.99% vs. 56.84%, 38.04%, 35.66%, respectively) and hepatitis-free survival rates (75.49%, 54.84%, 47.34% vs. 63.87%, 42.15%, 39.33%, respectively) were both superior in HBV-HCC recipients (both P<0.001). Multivariate analyses identified hepatitis, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, size of largest tumor, number of tumor nodules, TNM stage, vascular invasion and preoperative model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score as independent predictors of overall, tumor-free and hepatitis-free survival. Conclusions Survival outcomes after liver transplantation were significantly better in HBV-HCC patients than in HCV-HCC patients. This finding may be used to guide donor liver allocation in transplantation programs.",

        "abstract": "Use of organs from donors testing positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may safely expand the donor pool. The American Society of Transplantation convened a multidisciplinary expert panel that reviewed the existing literature and developed consensus recommendations for recipient management following the use of organs from HBV positive donors. Transmission risk is highest with liver donors and significantly lower with non\u2010liver (kidney and thoracic) donors. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of transmission to liver recipients from isolated HBV core antibody positive (anti\u2010HBc+) donors. Organs from anti\u2010HBc+ donors should be considered for all adult transplant candidates after an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits and appropriate patient consent. Indefinite antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in liver recipients with no immunity or vaccine immunity but not in liver recipients with natural immunity. Antiviral prophylaxis may be considered for up to 1 year in susceptible non\u2010liver recipients but is not recommended in immune non\u2010liver recipients. Although no longer the treatment of choice in patients with chronic HBV, lamivudine remains the most cost\u2010effective choice for prophylaxis in this setting.

        "title": "New Perspectives on Treatment of Hepatitis B Before and After Liver Transplantation.",
        "abstract": "The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects more than 260 million people globally, with increasing incidence, especially in developing countries. Despite antiviral therapies, HBV-related end-stage liver disease remains one of the most important indications for liver transplantation worldwide. Although new available treatments have improved the outcome of patients with both compensated and decompensated liver disease in some specific clinical settings as acute-on-chronic liver failure mortality is still high. Moreover, the incidence of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) seems to be increasing and represents a major challenge for the transplant team. In the post-transplant setting, combination of anti-HBV immunoglobulins and oral nucleos(t)ides provided significant improvement on graft and patient survival. Furthermore, recent data suggested the possibility of personalized therapeutic algorithms based on pre and post-transplant viral and host risk factors. Finally, liver grafts from HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) positive or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) donors can be safely used in order to expand the donor pool, considering adequate allocation and tailored prophylaxis after LT. In this review we have focused on the evolution of antiviral therapy for HBV, highlighting useful information to aid the transplant hepatologist in clinical practice.",

We aimed to report the outcomes of D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) KTx in recipients with or without hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb).\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty-three D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) living KTx cases were retrospectively identified. The 384 cases of KTx from hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)+ living donors to HBcAb- recipients [D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-)] were used as the control group. Primary endpoint was post-transplant HBsAg -\u2192+.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore KTx, 24 donors (28.9%) in the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) group were hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA+, and 20 recipients were HBsAb-. All eighty-three D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) recipients received HBV prophylaxis, while no D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-) recipients received prophylaxis. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range 6-106) and 36 months (range 4-107) for the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) and D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-) groups, respectively, 2/83 (2.41%) D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) recipients and 1/384 (0.26%) D(HBcAb+)/R(HBcAb-) became HBsAg+, accompanied with HBV DNA+ (P=0.083). The three recipients with HBsAg-\u2192+ were exclusively HBsAb-/HBcAb- before KTx. Recipient deaths were more frequent in the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) group (6.02% vs. 1.04%, P=0.011), while liver and graft function, rejection, infection, and graft loss were not significantly different. In univariate analyses, pre-transplant HBsAb-/HBcAb- combination in the D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) recipients carried a significantly higher risk of HBsAg-\u2192+, HBV DNA-\u2192+, and death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiving D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) KTx in HBsAb+ recipients provides excellent graft and patient survivals without HBV transmission. HBV transmission risks should be more balanced with respect to benefits of D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg-) KTx in HBsAb-/HBcAb- candidates.",

Moreover, no consensus has been reached for standardised prophylaxis regimens to prevent HBV transmission after D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg\u2212) KT. We developed stratified prophylaxis regimens, including pretransplant antiviral treatment of donors, and pretransplant hepatitis B vaccination and post-transplant antiviral treatment of recipients, based on donors\u2019 and recipients\u2019 HBV serological characteristics. However, the safety and efficacy of stratified prophylaxis regimens remains unknown. Methods and analysis We are conducting a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Between September 2020 and December 2023, 100 cases of (D(HBsAg+)/R (HBsAg\u2212)) KT will be recruited from four university-affiliated hospitals with a follow-up at least 2 years. They will naturally receive stratified prophylaxis regimens or routine prophylaxis based on clinical experience to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens in (D(HBsAg+)/R(HBsAg\u2212)) KT. The primary outcome will be post-transplant HBV infection to evaluate safety, defined as post-transplant HBsAg\u2212\u2192+or\u2009HBV DNA\u2212\u2192+. The composite endpoint of prevention failure will be also an endpoint of safety (any one of HBsAg\u2212\u2192+, HBV DNA\u2212\u2192+, HB e antigen\u2212\u2192+, HB e antibody\u2212\u2192+ and HB c antibody\u2212\u2192+).
