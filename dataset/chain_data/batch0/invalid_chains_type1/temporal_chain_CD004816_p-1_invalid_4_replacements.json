        "title": "Effects of atorvastatin on bone in postmenopausal women with dyslipidemia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIn preclinical models, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase have been shown to positively affect bone remodeling balance. Observational studies and secondary analyses from lipid-lowering trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the effect of these agents on bone mineral density and fracture risk.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to determine whether clinically significant skeletal benefits result from hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition in postmenopausal women.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nWe conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging comparative clinical trial at 62 sites in the United States.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nParticipants included 626 postmenopausal women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/liter) and less than 190 mg/dl (4.9 mmol/liter), and lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density T-score between 0.0 and -2.5.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nOnce-daily placebo or 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin was administered.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe assessed percent change from baseline in lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density with each dose of atorvastatin compared with placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 52 wk, there was no significant difference between each atorvastatin and placebo group or change from baseline at any tested dose of atorvastatin or placebo in lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density. Nor did atorvastatin produce a significant change in bone mineral density at any other site. Changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover did not differ significantly between each atorvastatin and placebo group. All doses of atorvastatin were generally well tolerated, with similar incidences of adverse events across all dose groups and placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinically relevant doses of atorvastatin that lower lipid levels had no effect on bone mineral density or biochemical indices of bone metabolism in this study, suggesting that such oral agents are not useful in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014High-density lipoproteins (HDL) have antiinflammatory effects on the vascular endothelium. Because bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known to be inflammatory mediators, we examined the effect of HDL on BMP signaling. Methods and Results\u2014Increasing concentrations of HDL progressively enhanced expression of the activin-like kinase receptor (ALK)1 and ALK2 in human aortic endothelial cells as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Induction of ALK1 was a result of enhanced ALK2 expression as determined by siRNA interference, and was associated with increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix Gla protein (MGP). The HDL-induction of ALK2 was dependent on BMP-signaling, and affected coregulation of the ALK2 gene by the homeodomain proteins MSX2, DLX3, and DLX5, as determined by reporter gene assays, siRNA interference, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Apolipoprotein A-I transgenic mice, known to have high HDL and inhibition of atherogenesis, exhibited similar changes in aortic gene expression as seen in endothelial cells treated with HDL in vitro. Conclusions\u2014We conclude that HDL benefits the arterial wall by allowing for enhanced ALK1 and ALK2 signaling, resulting in an increase of VEGF and MGP, essential for endothelial cell survival and prevention of vascular calcification, respectively.",

Setting Finland. Participants Women aged 45\u201375 years initiating statin therapy between 1996 and 2001 with adherence to statins \u226580% during the subsequent five years (n\u200a=\u200a40 254), a respective cohort initiating hypertension drugs (n\u200a=\u200a41 610), and women randomly selected from the population (n\u200a=\u200a62 585). Main Outcome Measures Incidence rate of and hazard ratio (HR) for low-energy hip fracture during the follow-up extending up to 7 years after the 5-year exposure period. Results Altogether 199 low-energy hip fractures occurred during the 135 330 person-years (py) of follow-up in the statin cohort, giving an incidence rate of 1.5 hip fractures per 1000 py. In the hypertension and the population cohorts, the rates were 2.0 per 1000 py (312 fractures per 157 090 py) and 1.0 per 1000 py (212 fractures per 216 329 py), respectively. Adjusting for a propensity score and individual variables strongly predicting the outcome, good adherence to statins for five years was associated with a 29% decreased risk (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.58\u20130.86) of a low-energy hip fracture in comparison with adherent use of hypertension drugs. The association was of the same magnitude when comparing the statin users with the population cohort, the HR being 0.69 (0.55\u20130.87). When women with poor (<40%), moderate (40 to 80%), and good adherence (\u226580%) to statins were compared to those with good adherence to hypertension drugs (\u226580%) or to the population cohort, the protective effect associated with statin use attenuated with the decreasing level of adherence. Conclusions 5-year exposure to statins is associated with a reduced risk of low-energy hip fracture in women aged 50\u201380 years without prior hospitalizations for fractures.",

Objective: The study objective was to examine the effect of statins on fracture risk in a Military Healthcare System (MHS) with similar access and standard of health care for its beneficiaries. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients enrolled in an MHS encompassing the period from October 1, 2003, to March 1, 2010. Statin users were defined as those receiving a statin for \u226590 days in Fiscal Year 2005, whereas nonusers were defined as individuals not receiving a statin throughout the study period. A propensity score\u2013matched cohort of statin users and nonusers was created using 42 variables. The outcomes were identified using ICD-9-CM codes in the follow-up period (October 1, 2006, to March 1, 2010). In all, 4 outcomes were examined: all fractures, femoral neck fractures, upper-extremity fractures, and lower-extremity fractures. Results: Of 46 249 patients, 6967 pairs of statin users and nonusers were matched. Statin users had a lower risk of femoral neck fracture in comparison to nonusers (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.36-0.94) but similar risk of all fractures, lower-extremity fractures, and upper-extremity fractures. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients managed in an MHS, statin use was associated with a lower risk of femoral neck fractures, but not all fractures, upper-extremity fractures, or lower-extremity fractures.",

        "abstract": "Background Statins have been linked to new-onset osteoporotic fractures (NOFs), and different statins may alter the risk for the development of NOFs. Aim In this study, we investigated the association between different statins and the development of NOFs. Patients and methods This was a longitudinal cohort study performed using data from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance, including case patients with NOFs from January 2004 to December 2013 and non-NOF subjects. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of NOFs associated with statin use. Nonuser subjects served as the reference group. Results A total of 44,405 patients with NOFs were identified from among 170,533 patients with hyperlipidemia during the study period. The risk of developing NOFs after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and concurrent medication use was lower among users of atorvastatin (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71\u20130.84) and rosuvastatin (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.81) than among simvastatin users. Lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin were not associated with the risk of developing NOFs compared with simvastatin users. Conclusion This study supports previous reports regarding a beneficial effect of statin use and NOF risk, but not all statins. Patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin were at lower risk of developing NOFs compared with simvastatin users during the 10-year follow-up. Other statins such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pitavastatin were not associated with NOFs. This study also highlighted that high-potency statin has a dose\u2013response effect on lower NOF risk.",

        "title": "Drug treatment strategies for osteoporosis in stroke patients",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Osteoporosis and subsequent fractures are well-recognized complications of stroke. However, drug treatment strategies for osteoporosis after stroke have been rarely discussed in the current guidelines for the management of stroke or osteoporosis. Areas covered The authors review the epidemiology, characteristics, pathophysiology, and risk prediction of post-stroke osteoporosis and fractures. Then they provide an overview of existing evidence regarding drug treatment strategies for osteoporosis in stroke patients. They also review the effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures for those drugs commonly used in stroke patients. Expert opinion Currently, there is scarce evidence. A small randomized control trial suggested that a single use of 4 mg of intravenous zoledronate within 5 weeks of stroke onset was beneficial for preserving BMD, while simultaneous use of calcium and vitamin D supplements may be effective in preventing hypocalcemia. Further studies are needed to address several important issues of post-stroke osteoporosis, including who (the eligibility for treatment), when (the best timing of treatment), what (which drug), and how long (the best duration of treatment). On the other hand, physicians should bear in mind that drugs commonly used for stroke, such as statins or warfarin, may have beneficial or adverse effects on BMD and fracture risks.",

        "abstract": "Fragility fracture is a worldwide problem and a main cause of disability and impaired quality of life. It is primarily caused by osteoporosis, characterized by impaired bone quantity and or quality. Proper diagnosis of osteoporosis is essential for prevention of fragility fractures. Osteoporosis can be primary in postmenopausal women because of estrogen deficiency. Secondary forms of osteoporosis are not uncommon in both men and women. Most systemic illnesses and organ dysfunction can lead to osteoporosis. The kidney plays a crucial role in maintaining physiological bone homeostasis by controlling minerals, electrolytes, acid-base, vitamin D and parathyroid function. Chronic kidney disease with its uremic milieu disturbs this balance, leading to renal osteodystrophy. Diabetes mellitus represents the most common secondary cause of osteoporosis. Thyroid and parathyroid disorders can dysregulate the osteoblast/osteoclast functions. Gastrointestinal disorders, malnutrition and malabsorption can result in mineral and vitamin D deficiencies and bone loss. Patients with chronic liver disease have a higher risk of fracture due to hepatic osteodystrophy. Proinflammatory cytokines in infectious, autoimmune, and hematological disorders can stimulate osteoclastogenesis, leading to osteoporosis. Moreover, drug-induced osteoporosis is not uncommon. In this review, we focus on causes, pathogenesis, and management of secondary osteoporosis.",

        "title": "Relationship between Nutritional Status, Food Consumption and Sarcopenia in Post-Stroke Rehabilitation: Preliminary Data",
        "abstract": "After a stroke, patients can suffer from sarcopenia, which can affect recovery. This could be closely related to an impairment in nutritional status. In this preliminary analysis of a longitudinal prospective study, we screened 110 subjects admitted to our rehabilitation center after a stroke. We then enrolled 61 patients, who underwent a 6-week course of rehabilitation treatment. We identified a group of 18 sarcopenic patients (SG), according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2), by evaluating muscle strength with the handgrip test, and muscle mass with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). With respect to the non-sarcopenic group (NSG), the SG at admission (T0) had worse muscle quality, according to the BIA-derived phase angle, and a lower score of MNA\u00ae-SF. In contrast to the NSG, the SG also exhibited lower values for both BMI and the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) at T0 and T1. Moreover, 33% of the SG had a major risk of nutrition-related complications (GNRI at T0 < 92) and discarded on average more food during the six weeks of rehabilitation (about one-third of the average daily plate waste). Of note is the fact that the Barthel Index\u2019s change from baseline indicated that the SG had a worse functional recovery than the NGS. These results suggest that an accurate diagnosis of sarcopenia, along with a proper evaluation of the nutritional status on admission to rehabilitation centers, appears strictly necessary to design individual, targeted physical and nutritional intervention for post-stroke patients, to improve their ability outcomes.",

Nutritional screening is a process with which to categorize the risk of malnutrition (i.e., nutritional risk) based on validated tools/procedures, which need to be rapid, simple, cost-effective, and reliable in the clinical setting. This review focuses on the tools/procedures used in stroke patients to assess nutritional risk, with a particular focus on their relationships with patients\u2019 clinical characteristics and outcomes. Different screening tools/procedures have been used in stroke patients, which have shown varying prevalence in terms of nutritional risk (higher in rehabilitation units) and significant relationships with clinical outcomes in the short- and long term, such as infection, disability, and mortality. Indeed, there have been few attempts to compare the usefulness and reliability of the different tools/procedures. More evidence is needed to identify appropriate approaches to assessing nutritional risk among stroke patients in the acute and sub-acute phase of disease or during rehabilitation; to evaluate the impact of nutritional treatment on the risk of malnutrition during hospital stay or rehabilitation unit; and to include nutritional screening in well-defined nutritional care protocols.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between parameters such as the neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, nutritional risk index (NRI) and immunonutrition status and disease activity in patients with ischemic stroke of the small-vessel, large-vessel and other etiologies. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the records of 1454 consecutive ischemic stroke patients hospitalized in the emergency department of Gaziosmanpasa Education and Research Hospital from 2019 to 2023. Results: Of the 1350 patients with ischemic stroke included in the study, 58.8% had small-vessel disease, 29.3% had large-vessel disease and 11.9% had other etiologies. There was a significant difference between the three etiology groups for PNI and CONUT. The mean of PNI was 47.30 \u00b1 8.06 in the other etiology group, 37.25 \u00b1 7.23 in the small-vessel group, and 34.78 \u00b1 8.16 in the large-vessel disease group. The mean of CONUT was 5.49 \u00b1 1.20 in the small-vessel group, 5.12 \u00b1 1.46 in the large-vessel group and 4.22 \u00b1 1.11 in the other etiology group. In addition, CONUT and PNI were also found to be independent risk factors for mortality. A negative significant correlation was observed between PNI and NLR (r: \u22120.692), SII (r: \u22120.591), and CONUT (r: \u22120.511). Significant correlations were observed between CONUT and NLR (r: 0.402), SII (r: 0.312). Conclusions: PNI, CONUT and NRI were found as more accurate prognostic indicators of nutritional status in patients with ischemic stroke. NLR and SII may be important predictive markers in the course and prognosis of stroke.",
