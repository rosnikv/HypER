        "title": "Effects of atorvastatin on bone in postmenopausal women with dyslipidemia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nIn preclinical models, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase have been shown to positively affect bone remodeling balance. Observational studies and secondary analyses from lipid-lowering trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the effect of these agents on bone mineral density and fracture risk.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to determine whether clinically significant skeletal benefits result from hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition in postmenopausal women.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nWe conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging comparative clinical trial at 62 sites in the United States.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nParticipants included 626 postmenopausal women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/liter) and less than 190 mg/dl (4.9 mmol/liter), and lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density T-score between 0.0 and -2.5.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nOnce-daily placebo or 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin was administered.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe assessed percent change from baseline in lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density with each dose of atorvastatin compared with placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 52 wk, there was no significant difference between each atorvastatin and placebo group or change from baseline at any tested dose of atorvastatin or placebo in lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density. Nor did atorvastatin produce a significant change in bone mineral density at any other site. Changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover did not differ significantly between each atorvastatin and placebo group. All doses of atorvastatin were generally well tolerated, with similar incidences of adverse events across all dose groups and placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinically relevant doses of atorvastatin that lower lipid levels had no effect on bone mineral density or biochemical indices of bone metabolism in this study, suggesting that such oral agents are not useful in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on bone mineral density in patients with acute ischemic heart disease.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nEighty-three patients (52 male and 31 female) with acute coronary syndrome were studied. They received treatment with atorvastatin using low doses (20 mg) and high doses (40 mg-80 mg). Initial and final cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D were obtained from every patient. Spine and hip bone mineral density were performed at the beginning and one year later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAtorvastatin treatment increases vitamin D (33%, p = 0.007) and decreases the individuals with vitamin D insufficiency. Bone mineral density increased in the spine (1.31%, p = 0.02), but it was significant only in male and patients presenting vitamin D levels higher than 30 nmol/l.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAtorvastatin has a beneficial effect on bone metabolism in patients with acute ischemic heart disease (mainly males) by incrementing bone mineral density in which vitamin D levels are required to be higher than 30 nmol/l for the drug to be effective.",

Setting Finland. Participants Women aged 45\u201375 years initiating statin therapy between 1996 and 2001 with adherence to statins \u226580% during the subsequent five years (n\u200a=\u200a40 254), a respective cohort initiating hypertension drugs (n\u200a=\u200a41 610), and women randomly selected from the population (n\u200a=\u200a62 585). Main Outcome Measures Incidence rate of and hazard ratio (HR) for low-energy hip fracture during the follow-up extending up to 7 years after the 5-year exposure period. Results Altogether 199 low-energy hip fractures occurred during the 135 330 person-years (py) of follow-up in the statin cohort, giving an incidence rate of 1.5 hip fractures per 1000 py. In the hypertension and the population cohorts, the rates were 2.0 per 1000 py (312 fractures per 157 090 py) and 1.0 per 1000 py (212 fractures per 216 329 py), respectively. Adjusting for a propensity score and individual variables strongly predicting the outcome, good adherence to statins for five years was associated with a 29% decreased risk (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.58\u20130.86) of a low-energy hip fracture in comparison with adherent use of hypertension drugs. The association was of the same magnitude when comparing the statin users with the population cohort, the HR being 0.69 (0.55\u20130.87). When women with poor (<40%), moderate (40 to 80%), and good adherence (\u226580%) to statins were compared to those with good adherence to hypertension drugs (\u226580%) or to the population cohort, the protective effect associated with statin use attenuated with the decreasing level of adherence. Conclusions 5-year exposure to statins is associated with a reduced risk of low-energy hip fracture in women aged 50\u201380 years without prior hospitalizations for fractures.",

        "abstract": "Background: Contradictory evidence exists regarding statin use and risk of osteoporotic fractures. Objective: The study objective was to examine the effect of statins on fracture risk in a Military Healthcare System (MHS) with similar access and standard of health care for its beneficiaries. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients enrolled in an MHS encompassing the period from October 1, 2003, to March 1, 2010. Statin users were defined as those receiving a statin for \u226590 days in Fiscal Year 2005, whereas nonusers were defined as individuals not receiving a statin throughout the study period. A propensity score\u2013matched cohort of statin users and nonusers was created using 42 variables. The outcomes were identified using ICD-9-CM codes in the follow-up period (October 1, 2006, to March 1, 2010). In all, 4 outcomes were examined: all fractures, femoral neck fractures, upper-extremity fractures, and lower-extremity fractures. Results: Of 46 249 patients, 6967 pairs of statin users and nonusers were matched. Statin users had a lower risk of femoral neck fracture in comparison to nonusers (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.36-0.94) but similar risk of all fractures, lower-extremity fractures, and upper-extremity fractures. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients managed in an MHS, statin use was associated with a lower risk of femoral neck fractures, but not all fractures, upper-extremity fractures, or lower-extremity fractures.",

        "abstract": "Background Statins have been linked to new-onset osteoporotic fractures (NOFs), and different statins may alter the risk for the development of NOFs. Aim In this study, we investigated the association between different statins and the development of NOFs. Patients and methods This was a longitudinal cohort study performed using data from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance, including case patients with NOFs from January 2004 to December 2013 and non-NOF subjects. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of NOFs associated with statin use. Nonuser subjects served as the reference group. Results A total of 44,405 patients with NOFs were identified from among 170,533 patients with hyperlipidemia during the study period. The risk of developing NOFs after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and concurrent medication use was lower among users of atorvastatin (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71\u20130.84) and rosuvastatin (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.81) than among simvastatin users. Lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin were not associated with the risk of developing NOFs compared with simvastatin users. Conclusion This study supports previous reports regarding a beneficial effect of statin use and NOF risk, but not all statins. Patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin were at lower risk of developing NOFs compared with simvastatin users during the 10-year follow-up. Other statins such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pitavastatin were not associated with NOFs. This study also highlighted that high-potency statin has a dose\u2013response effect on lower NOF risk.",

        "abstract": "Objective Whether HMG-CoA-reductase inhibition, the main mechanism of statins, plays a role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, is not entirely known so far. Consequently, this study was set out to investigate the relationship of different kinds and dosages of statins with osteoporosis, hypothesising that the inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol could influence sex-hormones and therefore the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Methods Medical claims data of all Austrians from 2006 to 2007 was used to identify all patients treated with statins to compute their daily defined dose averages of six different types of statins. We applied multiple logistic regression to analyse the dose-dependent risks of being diagnosed with osteoporosis for each statin individually. Results In the general study population, statin treatment was associated with an overrepresentation of diagnosed osteoporosis compared with controls (OR: 3.62, 95%\u2009CI 3.55 to 3.69, p<0.01). There was a highly non-trivial dependence of statin dosage with the ORs of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was underrepresented in low-dose statin treatment (0\u201310\u2009mg per day), including lovastatin (OR: 0.39, CI 0.18 to 0.84, p<0.05), pravastatin (OR: 0.68, 95%\u2009CI 0.52 to 0.89, p<0.01), simvastatin (OR: 0.70, 95%\u2009CI 0.56 to 0.86, p<0.01) and rosuvastatin (OR: 0.69, 95%\u2009CI 0.55 to 0.87, p<0.01). However, the exceeding of the 40\u2009mg threshold for simvastatin (OR: 1.64, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 2.07, p<0.01), and the exceeding of a 20\u2009mg threshold for atorvastatin (OR: 1.78, 95%\u2009CI 1.41 to 2.23, p<0.01) and for rosuvastatin (OR: 2.04, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 3.18, p<0.01) was related to an overrepresentation of osteoporosis. Conclusion Our results show that the diagnosis of osteoporosis in statin-treated patients is dose-dependent. Thus, osteoporosis is underrepresented in low-dose and overrepresented in high-dose statin treatment, demonstrating the importance of future studies\u2019 taking dose-dependency into account when investigating the relationship between statins and osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Ample evidence supports the use of statin therapy for secondary prevention in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but evidence is wanting in the case of primary prevention, low-risk individuals, and elderly adults 65+. Statins are effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which has long been a target for treatment decisions. We discuss the weakening dependence between cholesterol levels and mortality as a function of age and highlight recent findings on lipoprotein subfractions and other superior markers of ASCVD risk. The efficacy of statins is compared for distinct subsets of patients based on age, diabetes, ASCVD, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) status. Most cardiovascular risk calculators heavily weight age and overestimate one\u2019s absolute risk of ASCVD, particularly in very old adults. Improvements in risk assessment enable the identification of specific patient populations that benefit most from statin treatment. Derisking is particularly important for adults over 75, in whom treatment benefits are reduced and adverse musculoskeletal effects are amplified. The CAC score stratifies the benefit effect size obtainable with statins, and forms of coenzyme Q are discussed for improving patient outcomes. Robust risk estimator tools and personalized, evidence-based approaches are needed to optimally reduce cardiovascular events and mortality rates through administration of cholesterol-lowering medications.",

        "abstract": "Fragility fracture is a worldwide problem and a main cause of disability and impaired quality of life. It is primarily caused by osteoporosis, characterized by impaired bone quantity and or quality. Proper diagnosis of osteoporosis is essential for prevention of fragility fractures. Osteoporosis can be primary in postmenopausal women because of estrogen deficiency. Secondary forms of osteoporosis are not uncommon in both men and women. Most systemic illnesses and organ dysfunction can lead to osteoporosis. The kidney plays a crucial role in maintaining physiological bone homeostasis by controlling minerals, electrolytes, acid-base, vitamin D and parathyroid function. Chronic kidney disease with its uremic milieu disturbs this balance, leading to renal osteodystrophy. Diabetes mellitus represents the most common secondary cause of osteoporosis. Thyroid and parathyroid disorders can dysregulate the osteoblast/osteoclast functions. Gastrointestinal disorders, malnutrition and malabsorption can result in mineral and vitamin D deficiencies and bone loss. Patients with chronic liver disease have a higher risk of fracture due to hepatic osteodystrophy. Proinflammatory cytokines in infectious, autoimmune, and hematological disorders can stimulate osteoclastogenesis, leading to osteoporosis. Moreover, drug-induced osteoporosis is not uncommon. In this review, we focus on causes, pathogenesis, and management of secondary osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Hypovitaminosis D is a serious public health problem, representing an independent factor in mortality among the general population. Vitamin D deficiency may affect up to one billion people worldwide. Recently, the potential association between vitamin D levels and stroke has gained increasing attention. Many studies suggest that maintaining normal serum vitamin D levels is associated with improvement of the cardiovascular system and a reduction in stroke risk. As a neurosteroid, vitamin D influences brain development and function and immunomodulation and affects brain neuroplasticity. It supports many processes that maintain homeostasis in the body. As stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide, more studies are needed to confirm the positive effects of vitamin D supplementation, its dosage at different stages of the disease, method of determination, and effect on stroke onset and recovery. Many studies on stroke survivors indicate that serum vitamin D levels only offer insignificant benefits and are not beneficial to recovery. This review article aims to highlight recent publications that have examined the potential of vitamin D supplementation to improve rehabilitation outcomes in stroke survivors.

        "abstract": "Considering that malnutrition (undernutrition) is common in stroke patients and may negatively impact body function, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between nutritional risk and functional status in stroke patients at admission to a rehabilitation unit. Nutritional risk was assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score. Functional status was assessed using the Barthel Index, the modified Rankin Scale, the Trunk Control Test and the Sitting Balance Scale, and cognitive function was assessed using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and D-dimer were also evaluated as established prognostic biomarkers. Stroke patients (n = 245; age 69.7 \u00b1 12.8 years; 47%, women; 82% ischemic stroke) at admission to a rehabilitation unit were included in this study. A high prevalence of nutritional risk was detected with each tool and was found to be greater using the GNRI and in patients aged \u226575 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age and dysphagia were independent predictors of high nutritional risk. High risk groups performed worse on all functional tests compared to the low-risk groups (p < 0.05). Nutritional risk with each tool was associated with functional and cognitive statuses (with the highest correlation being with the Trunk Control Test). Significant associations were also found with C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and D-dimer. In conclusion, a high nutritional risk, as evaluated with the GNRI, the PNI and the CONUT score, was detected in stroke patients at admission to a rehabilitation unit. High nutritional risk was associated with functional status and with predictors of clinical outcomes (and specifically in older patients).",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between parameters such as the neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, nutritional risk index (NRI) and immunonutrition status and disease activity in patients with ischemic stroke of the small-vessel, large-vessel and other etiologies. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the records of 1454 consecutive ischemic stroke patients hospitalized in the emergency department of Gaziosmanpasa Education and Research Hospital from 2019 to 2023. Results: Of the 1350 patients with ischemic stroke included in the study, 58.8% had small-vessel disease, 29.3% had large-vessel disease and 11.9% had other etiologies. There was a significant difference between the three etiology groups for PNI and CONUT.
