        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has any effect on the development of liver decompensation and on survival of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).METHODS:A total of 86 patients with compensated PBC were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (n = 43) or to remain untreated (controls, n = 43). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Mean follow-up was 7.3 \u00b1 3.0 yr in the UDCA and 8.1 \u00b1 3.1 yr in the control group. Fourteen control patients were crossed-over to UDCA therapy after a median of 3.5 yr (range 2\u20138 yr), at their own request.RESULTS:Liver decompensation developed in 41 patients (22 in the UDCA and 19 in the control group) and liver death or transplantation in 33 (19 in the UDCA and 14 in the control group) patients. There was no significant difference in the probability of development of liver decompensation, liver death, or transplantation (by log-rank test) between UDCA-treated and control patients, whether by an intention-to-treat or by treatment-as-received analysis.CONCLUSIONS:UDCA was not found to have any demonstrable effect on the long-term outcome of PBC and did not improve the survival of PBC patients.",

        "abstract": "Recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been described in liver transplant recipients. Type of immunosuppression has been reported to influence the frequency of recurrence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence and pattern of recurrent PBC in our liver transplant recipients and determine any association of immunosuppressive agents with its recurrence. Patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for PBC were identified from the University of Chicago Liver Transplant Database. Recurrent PBC was diagnosed based on specific pathological criteria. Of 46 patients who underwent OLT for PBC between 1984 and 2000, a total of 7 patients (15%) were diagnosed with recurrent PBC at a median of 78 months (range, 27 to 120 months) after OLT. Forty\u2010three percent of patients were administered cyclosporine, whereas 57% were administered tacrolimus before disease recurrence. Rates of recurrence were not different between patients maintained on cyclosporine therapy (16%) compared with those maintained on tacrolimus therapy (18%; P = 1.0). There also was no difference in frequency of rejection episodes or duration of corticosteroid therapy between those who did and did not have recurrent PBC. In conclusion, recurrent PBC developed in a small number of patients 2 years or longer after OLT. In our population, there was no difference in recurrence rates between those administered cyclosporine or tacrolimus for immunosuppression. (Liver Transpl 2003;9:733\u2010736.)",

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and severity of IBD after liver transplantation and to perform a multivariate analysis for possible risk factors. In this retrospective study, 91 patients transplanted for PSC or AIH, without prior colectomy, were included. Sixty patients were transplanted for PSC, 31 for AIH. IBD activity before and after OLT and other possible risk factors were analysed in a multivariate model. Forty\u2010nine patients (54%) had IBD before OLT. Forty patients (44%) had active IBD after transplantation: recurrence in 32 and de novo in 8. Cumulative risk for IBD after OLT was 15, 39 and 54% after 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively. In 59% of patients with IBD prior to OLT the disease was more active after transplantation. Risk factors for recurrent disease were: symptoms at time of OLT, short interval of IBD before OLT and use of tacrolimus. 5\u2010aminosalicylates were protective. A cytomegalovirus positive donor/negative recipient combination increased the risk for de novo IBD.",

This goal has been achievedby alternating oxidative and reductive steps in a one-pot system employing HSDHs with different cofactorspecificity, namely NADH-dependent HSDHs in theoxidative step and an NADPH-dependent 7b-HSDHin the reductive one. Coupled in situ regenerationsystems have been exploited not only to allow theuse of catalytic amounts of the cofactors, but also toprovide the necessary driving force to opposite reac-tions (i.e., oxidation and reduction) acting on differ-ent sites of the substrate molecule. Biocatalysts suita-ble for the set-up of this process have been selectedand their kinetic behaviour in respect of the reac-tions of interest has been evaluated.

        "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs) can recur following liver transplantation (LT) despite immunosuppressive therapy, with implications for graft survival. Although the evidence is not robust, disease recurrence seems to occur in the presence of less intense and/or steroid\u2010free immunosuppression (IS) in particular in the case of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The main risk factor for AIH recurrence is the severity of disease activity in the explant and potential donor/recipient human leukocyte antigen D\u2010related 3 (DR3) mismatch. The treatment for AIH recurrence includes reintroduction or increase in the dose of steroids with or without the addition of azathioprine. T cell\u2013mediated rejection episodes are also more common in AILD. Steroid withdrawal is the common practice in LT for non\u2010AILD, eliminating the risks associated with longterm exposure to steroids. In AILD, maintenance of steroids at a low dose in the long term may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and rejection. This strategy is safe when there is vigilance for steroid\u2010related adverse effects. Alternatively, identifying patients who are at the greatest risk for disease recurrence and who would benefit from intensified IS might be an option.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims A 40% risk of disease recurrence post-liver transplantation (LT) for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been previously reported. Risk factors for recurrence and its impact on long-term patient outcome are poorly defined. We aimed to assess prevalence, time to disease recurrence, as well as patient and graft survival in patients with recurrent AIH (rAIH) versus those without recurrence. Methods Single-center retrospective study of adult recipients who underwent LT for AIH between January 2007 and December 2017. Patients with AIH overlap syndromes were excluded. Results A total of 1436 LTs were performed during the study period, of whom 46 (3%) for AIH. Eight patients had AIH overlap syndromes and were excluded. Patients were followed up for 4.4 \u00b1 3.4 years and mean age at LT was 46.8 years. Average transplant MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score was 24.9. About 21% of patients (8 of 38) were transplanted for acute onset of AIH; 66% of patients (n = 25) received a deceased donor liver graft, and 34% a living donor organ. rAIH occurred in 7.8% (n = 3/38) of recipients. Time to recurrence was 1.6, 12.2 and 60.7 months. Patient and graft survival in patients without recurrence was 88.6% and 82.8% in 5 years, whereas in those with rAIH, it was 66.7%, respectively. Conclusion Although AIH recurs post-LT, our data indicate a lower recurrence rate when compared to the literature and excellent patient and graft survival.",

        "abstract": "The advances in acute phase care have firmly established the practice of organ transplantation in the last several decades. Then, the next issues that loom large in the field of transplantation include antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and recurrent primary disease. Acute ABMR is a daunting hurdle in the performance of organ transplantation. The recent progress in desensitization and preoperative monitoring of donor-specific antibodies enables us to increase positive outcomes. However, chronic active ABMR is one of the most significant problems we currently face. On the other hand, recurrent primary disease is problematic for many recipients. Notably, some recipients, unfortunately, lost their vital organs due to this recurrence. Although some progress has been achieved in these two areas, many other factors remain largely obscure. In this review, these two topics will be discussed in light of recent discoveries.",

        "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and obliteration of both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, accompanied by cholestasis, with further outcome in biliary cirrhosis of the liver, cholangiocarcinoma. The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood, but, according to various sources, it involves genetic factors, innate and adaptive immunity mechanisms, the toxic effects of hydrophobic bile acids and, possibly, intestinal dysbiosis. The strong association with inflammatory bowel disease is associated with a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer, which, along with cholangiocarcinoma, represents the most significant diagnostic challenge in the long-term management of PSC. The diagnosis of PSC is established based on the identification of typical cholangiographic lesions of the bile ducts and the exclusion of secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis. Complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity of clinical features and the rare nature of the disease have led to the lack of effective therapy to date; there are no treatment algorithms, but a course of ursodeoxycholic acid in doses of 17\u201323 mg/kg/day can be prescribed for up to a year in order to monitor the dynamics of the decrease in levels serum alkaline phosphatase. A number of drugs are under investigation, including FXR (farnesoid X receptor) agonists with choleretic and antimicrobial properties. Clinically significant stenoses can be successfully treated with interventional endoscopy, but liver transplantation (LT) is currently the only curative treatment with a high survival rate. According to various literature data, 20\u201325% of patients develop disease relapse in the graft.
