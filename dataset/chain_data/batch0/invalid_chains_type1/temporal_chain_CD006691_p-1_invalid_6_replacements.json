        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMetabolic control often deteriorates during puberty in children with type 1 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether addition of metformin for 3 Months improves metabolic control and insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwenty-six of 30 randomised adolescents with type 1 diabetes (18 females, eight males) completed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Their mean age was 16.9+/-1.6 (s.d.) Years, mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 9.5+/-1.1% and daily insulin dosage 1.2+/-0.3 U/kg. The participants were randomised to receive oral metformin or placebo for 3 Months. HbA(1c) was measured Monthly, and peripheral insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp at baseline and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHbA(1c) decreased significantly in the group treated with metformin, from 9.6 to 8.7% (P<0.05), but was unchanged in the placebo group (9.5 vs 9.2%). Peripheral glucose uptake divided by mean plasma insulin concentration was increased in the metformin group (P<0.05) but not in the placebo group. Initial insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated to changes in HbA(1c) (r=-0.62; P<0.05) and positively correlated to changes in insulin sensitivity (r=0.77; P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this double-blind placebo-controlled study we found that metformin improves metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The effect seems to be associated with an increased insulin-induced glucose uptake.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the safety and effectiveness of rosiglitazone in the treatment of overweight subjects with type 1 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 50 adult type 1 diabetic subjects with a baseline BMI > or =27 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to take insulin and placebo (n = 25) or insulin and rosiglitazone 4 mg twice daily (n = 25) for a period of 8 months. Insulin regimen and dosage were modified in all subjects to achieve near-normal glycemic control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups experienced a significant reduction in HbA(1c) (A1C) level (rosiglitazone: 7.9 +/- 1.3 to 6.9 +/- 0.7%, P < 0.0001; placebo: 7.7 +/- 0.8 to 7.0 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.002) and a significant increase in weight (rosiglitazone: 97.2 +/- 11.8 to 100.6 +/- 16.0 kg, P = 0.008; placebo: 96.4 +/- 12.2 to 99.1 +/- 15.0, P = 0.016). Baseline measures of BMI (P = 0.001), total daily insulin dose (P = 0.002), total cholesterol (P = 0.005), HDL cholesterol (P = 0.001), and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) were predictors of improvement in A1C level only in the group treated with rosiglitazone. Total daily insulin dose increased in subjects taking placebo (74.0 +/- 33.8 to 82.0 +/- 48.9 units, P < 0.05 baseline vs. week 32), but it decreased slightly in subjects taking rosiglitazone (77.5 +/- 28.6 to 75.3 +/- 33.1 units). Both systolic blood pressure (137.4 +/- 15.6 vs. 128.8 +/- 14.8 mmHg, baseline vs. week 32, P < 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (87.2 +/- 9.4 vs. 79.4 +/- 7.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) improved in the group treated with rosiglitazone. The total incidence of hypoglycemia did not differ between groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRosiglitazone in combination with insulin resulted in improved glycemic control and blood pressure without an increase in insulin requirements, compared with insulin- and placebo-treated subjects, whose improved glycemic control required an 11% increase in insulin dose. Weight gain and hypoglycemia were similar in both groups at the end of the study. The greatest effect of rosiglitazone occurred in subjects with more pronounced markers of insulin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Crude saponins derived from Chinese Platycodi radix have been reported to prevent increases in body weight and liver TAG in mice fed a high-fat diet. We investigated the effects of an extract (PR) taken from Korean Platycodi radix, which is cultivated for 22 years in the ground (Jangsaeng doraji), and its saponins (PRS) on insulin resistance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in 90 % pancreatectomized diabetic rats fed high-fat diets. Four groups were orally supplemented with 2 g PR, 0.2 g PRS, 20 mg rosiglitazone (positive control) or 0.5 g cellulose (negative control) per kg body weight on a daily basis for 8 weeks. We found that PRS lowered body weight, visceral fat mass and serum leptin levels in pancreatectomized rats in comparison to the control. PR enhanced first- and second-phase insulin secretion while PRS stimulated only first-phase insulin secretion. Glucose infusion rates to maintain euglycaemia at hyperinsulinaemic states decreased in a descending order of rosiglitazone, PRS, PR and control, but they increased hepatic glucose output in the same order. This reduction was associated with the storage of decreased TAG and increased glycogen, which was a result of enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of anti-insulin receptor substrate-2 and serine473 phosphporylation of protein kinase B (PKB, Akt). Improved hepatic insulin signalling led to decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression and reduced hepatic glucose output accordingly. In conclusion, PRS principally improves glucose homeostasis by enhancing hepatic insulin sensitivity as a consequence of reducing fat storage and stimulating insulin signalling in diabetic rats. In addition, PR contains components that promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.",

        "title": "Neuroprotection by Radical Avoidance: Search for Suitable Agents",
        "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is frequently associated with damage by free radicals. However, increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which may ultimately lead to neuronal cell death, do not necessarily reflect its primary cause, but can be a consequence of otherwise induced cellular dysfunction. Detrimental processes which promote free radical formation are initiated, e.g., by disturbances in calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial malfunction, and an age-related decline in the circadian oscillator system. Free radicals generated at high rates under pathophysiological conditions are insufficiently detoxified by scavengers. Interventions at the primary causes of dysfunction, which avoid secondary rises in radical formation, may be more efficient. The aim of such approaches should be to prevent calcium overload, to reduce mitochondrial electron dissipation, to support electron transport capacity, and to avoid circadian perturbations. L-Theanine and several amphiphilic nitrones are capable of counteracting excitotoxicity and/or mitochondrial radical formation. Resveratrol seems to promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial effects of leptin include attenuation of electron leakage. Melatonin combines all the requirements mentioned, additionally regulates anti- and pro-oxidant enzymes and is, with few exceptions, very well tolerated. In this review, the perspectives, problems and limits of drugs are compared which may be suitable for reducing the formation of free radicals.",

In contrast to murine BAT, human BAT is not present as a single major fat depot in a well-defined location. The distribution of BAT in several areas in the body significantly limits its availability to research. A human brown adipocyte cell line is therefore critical in broadening the options available to researchers in the field. The human BAT-cell line PAZ6 was created to address such a need and has been well characterized by several research groups around the world.

        "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue contributes importantly to homeothermy and energy balance in rodents due its ability under demand to produce heat through a process denominated nonshivering thermogenesis. Such thermogenic ability of brown adipocytes relies on the activity of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 that, when properly activated, dissipates energy from oxidative metabolism as heat. Brown adipose tissue sympathetic innervation through norepinephrine release not only induces brown adipocyte lipolysis and thermogenesis, but also acts as the major determinant of tissue mass, cellularity and mitochondrial content. Several pieces of evidence gathered over the years indicate that, in addition to tissue sympathetic innervation, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 plays an important role in regulating the development, metabolism and thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue. Herein we review the main evidence supporting such key role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 to brown fat biology and discuss the future directions of this important area of research.",

        "title": "The dynamic nature of resting metabolic rate",
        "abstract": "Assessment of resting metabolic rate \u2014 the amount of energy that the body needs to function while resting \u2014 is considered a cornerstone of personalized nutrition. And with the advent of portable calorimeters for human use, measurements of metabolic rate are likely to become more common in clinical practice over the years to come. However, as nutritionists move towards this goal, they will probably need to account for the fact that resting metabolic rate is not as static as it was once presumed. Intra-subject variability in resting metabolic rate is often attributed to physiological regulation, but the dynamics and the mechanisms of this regulation are still under investigation. New insights into this topic can be found in several of the articles published in Temperature. Daanen and Van Marken Lichtenbelt discuss the contribution of nonshivering thermogenesis to the metabolic rate of adult humans. Until recently, nonshivering thermogenesis was thought to be an exclusive feature of subjects that have a well-defined depot of brown fat, such as small mammals and newborn humans. However, this view started to change when brown adipocytes were found scatted in the supraclavicular white fat of adult humans. The available evidence indicates that, in adult humans, nonshivering thermogenesis is activated before shivering in response to mild cold, and can account for an increase of 10\u201320% in metabolic rate. This contribution may vary depending on genetic background and environmental factors. The influence of the environment might be related to adipocyte browning, the process by which white adipocytes can be transformed into thermogenic brown adipocytes. A protein known as \u2018PR domain zinc finger protein 16\u2019 (Prdm16) has been shown to play a major role in this process, being capable of activating the full genetic program of thermogenic brown adipocytes. Brown adipocyte differentiation also seems to be under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPAR-g). Of particular relevance to nutritional sciences is the increasing body of evidence indicating that nonshivering thermogenesis can be governed by non-thermal factors, including metabolic signals. Motivated by the potential use of vagal nerve stimulation as a treatment for obesity, Madden et al. investigated how non-thermal sensory fibers of the vagus nerve can modulate nonshivering thermogenesis in experimental rats. The results revealed that vagal afferents suppress brown fat activity via a neural reflex involving glutamatergic activation of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract and subsequent GABAergic inhibition of sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral raphe pallidus. Mohammed et al. have also shown the importance of non-thermal signals in the control of brown fat thermogenesis in rats, but, in that case, a cross-talk was found between fasting-stimulated orexigenic neurons and brown fat. In another study, Miko et al. have described alarin as an atypical orexigenic peptide: whereas typical orexigenic peptides increase appetite and suppress metabolic rate, alarin increases both appetite and metabolic rate. Drugs are also non-thermal factors of relevance in assessments of resting metabolic rate, and, in this context, amphetamines deserve attention. To make matters even more interesting, it has been recently discovered that nonshivering thermogenesis displays an ultradian rhythmicity that may be independent of sensory inputs. This topic is covered in an authoritative review by Blessing and Ootsuka, which presents a fresh approach for studying integrative physiology, in addition to providing a historical account of the authors\u2019 discovery. Such an approach consists of analyzing physiological data at the individual level, as opposed to the more conventional analysis of group averages. Using this approach, the authors discovered that the brown fat temperature of unanesthetized rats increases suddenly, for no apparent reason, every 1\u20132 hours in both the light and dark phases of the day. These ultradian bursts in brown fat thermogenesis do not seem to reflect a thermoregulatory reflex, but rather a brain-initiated anticipatory behavior. Indeed, the ultradian bursts in brown fat thermogenesis start concurrently with exploratory behavior,",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT White adipose tissue (WAT) thermogenic activity may play a role in whole-body energy balance and two of its main regulators are thought to be environmental temperature (Tenv) and exercise. Low Tenv may increase uncoupling protein one (UCP1; the main biomarker of thermogenic activity) in WAT to regulate body temperature. On the other hand, exercise may stimulate UCP1 in WAT, which is thought to alter body weight regulation. However, our understanding of the roles (if any) of Tenv and exercise in WAT thermogenic activity remains incomplete. Our aim was to examine the impacts of low Tenv and exercise on WAT thermogenic activity, which may alter energy homeostasis and body weight regulation. We conducted a series of four experimental studies, supported by two systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We found increased UCP1 mRNA (p = 0.03; but not protein level) in human WAT biopsy samples collected during the cold part of the year, a finding supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO review protocol: CRD42019120116). Additional clinical trials (NCT04037371; NCT04037410) using Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) revealed no impact of low Tenv on human WAT thermogenic activity (p > 0.05). Furthermore, we found no effects of exercise on UCP1 mRNA or protein levels (p > 0.05) in WAT biopsy samples from a human randomized controlled trial (Clinical trial: NCT04039685), a finding supported by systematic review and meta-analytic data (PROSPERO review protocol: CRD42019120213). Taken together, the present experimental and meta-analytic findings of UCP1 and SUVmax, demonstrate that cold and exercise may play insignificant roles in human WAT thermogenic activity.

        "abstract": "The crosstalk between the exercising muscle and the adipose tissue, mediated by myokines and metabolites, derived from both tissues during exercise has created a controversy between animal and human studies with respect to the impact of exercise on the browning process. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-culturing of C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes under the stimuli of electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) mimicking muscle contraction can impact the expression of UCP1, PGC-1a, and IL-6 in adipocytes, therefore providing evidence on the direct crosstalk between adipocytes and stimulated muscle cells. In the co-cultured C2C12 cells, EPS increased the expression of PGC-1a (p = 0.129; d = 0.73) and IL-6 (p = 0.09; d = 1.13) protein levels. When EPS was applied, we found that co-culturing led to increases in UCP1 (p = 0.044; d = 1.29) and IL-6 (p = 0.097; d = 1.13) protein expression in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The expression of PGC-1a increased by EPS but was not significantly elevated after co-culturing (p = 0.448; d = 0.08). In vitro co-culturing of C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes under the stimuli of EPS leads to increased expression of thermogenic proteins. These findings indicate changes in the expression pattern of proteins related to browning of adipose tissue, supporting the use of this in vitro model to study the crosstalk between adipocytes and contracting muscle.",

In vitro exercise, mimicking neuronal signals leading to muscle contraction in vitro, can be a valuable tool to address this issue. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE and PubMed (from database inception to 4 February 2022) for relevant studies assessing in vitro exercise using electrical pulse stimulation to mimic exercise. Meta-analyses of mean differences and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Of 985 reports identified, 41 were eligible for analysis. We observed variability among existing protocols of in vitro exercise and heterogeneity among protocols of the same type of exercise. Our analyses showed that AMPK, Akt, IL-6, and PGC1a levels and glucose uptake increased in stimulated compared to non-stimulated cells, following the patterns of in vivo exercise, and that these effects correlated with the duration of stimulation. We conclude that in vitro exercise follows motifs of exercise in humans, allowing biological parameters, such as the aforementioned, to be valuable tools in defining the types of in vitro exercise.

        "abstract": "Seaweed extracts and their specific polysaccharides are widely known for their ability to act as reducing and capping agents during nanoparticle synthesis. Their application is highly favored in green synthesis methods, owing to their eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and remarkable time and energy efficiency. In this study, fucoidan extracted from Undaria pinnatifida sporophyll (UPS) is introduced as a polysaccharide that effectively serves as a dual-function reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Results from various analyses indicate that AuNPs derived from UPS extract display a uniform spherical shape with an average size of 28.34 \u00b1 1.15 nm and a zeta potential of \u221237.49 \u00b1 2.13 mV, conclusively confirming the presence of Au. The FT-IR spectra distinctly revealed the characteristic fucoidan bands on the stabilized UPS-AuNPs surface. A 1H-NMR analysis provided additional confirmation by revealing the presence of specific fucoidan protons on the UPS-AuNPs surface. To comprehensively evaluate the impact of UPS extract, UPS-AuNPs, and fucoidan on the biological properties of adipocytes, a rigorous comparative analysis of lipid droplet formation and morphology was conducted. Our findings revealed that adipocytes treated with UPS extract, fucoidan, and UPS-AuNPs, in that order, exhibited a reduction in the total lipid droplet surface area, maximum Ferret diameter, and overall Nile red staining intensity when compared to mature white adipocytes. Furthermore, our analysis of the effects of UPS extracts, UPS-AuNPs, and fucoidan on the expression of key markers associated with white adipose tissue browning, such as UCP1, PGC1a, and PRDM16, demonstrated increased mRNA and protein expression levels in the following order: UPS-AuNPs > fucoidan > UPS extracts. Notably, the production of active mitochondria, which play a crucial role in enhancing energy expenditure in beige adipocytes, also increased in the following order: UPS-AuNPs > fucoidan > UPS extract. These findings underscore the pivotal role of UPS extract, fucoidan, and UPS-AuNPs in promoting adipocyte browning and subsequently enhancing energy expenditure.",
