        "abstract": "&NA; Various parameters of sexual functioning were assessed in a prospective, crossover investigation of 53 surgically menopausal women. Patients randomly received either an estrogen\u2010androgen combined preparation, an estrogen\u2010alone drug, an androgen\u2010alone drug, or a placebo. Also included were a group of women who had undergone hysterectomy and whose ovaries had been left intact. Two treatment phases, each of 3 months' duration, were separated by an intervening placebo month. Additionally, plasma levels of total estrogens and testosterone were assayed four times during the study concurrent with monitoring of sexual behaviors. It was clear that exogenous androgen enhanced the intensity of sexual desire and arousal and the frequency of sexual fantasies in hysterectomized and oophorectomized women. However, there was no evidence that testosterone affected physiologic response or interpersonal aspects of sexual behavior. These findings suggest that the major impact of androgen in women is on sexual motivation and not on sexual activity per se.",

In this article, we first review the current conceptual models of desire and consider key difficulties in the formulation and treatment of desire problems. The role of biological and other determinants of desire are briefly reviewed, and the clinical approaches of other researchers are compared and contrasted. Overall, we have observed a trend toward a more comprehensive and far\u2010reaching evaluation process in these cases and an increasing awareness of the clinical complexities involved. Then we review in depth a number of specific areas for clinical evaluation and present case examples of each. In particular, recommendations are made for the evaluation of developmental and health factors and the effects of sexual trauma, depression, intrapsychic conflicts, and interpersonal issues. Finally, approaches to treatment are briefly noted.",

The results of this clinical study confirm and extend the observations originally made by Waxenberg and his colleagues in 1959, that testosterone deficiency in women produces a marked decrease in libido and sexual responsiveness.

        "abstract": "Psychosexual dysfunction is often suggested the cause of the disturbed eating habits associated with hypothalamic secondary amenorrhea.In contrast, we explored the possibility that impaired sexual function may result from reduced levels of testosterone in amenorrheic subjects as a consequence of particular lifestyles. We studied the effects of erotic stimuli in two experiments, one comparing amenorrheic women to normal controls, the other comparing testosterone substitution to a placebo treatment. The amenorrheic women had a higher incidence of lifestyle and bodily conditions identified as risk factors for amenorrhea (i.e., weight loss before the onset of amenorrhea, low body weight, strenuous exercise, and vegetarianism), lower levels of testosterone, and impaired sexual function compared with normally menstruating women. In an experimental session in which amenorrheic women were asked to produce erotic fantasies, they demonstrated a reduced capacity for sexual fantasizing, less subjective sexual excitement, and less vaginal vasocongestion (vaginal pulse amplitude). However, when exposed to the stronger of two erotic film excerpts, the degree of vaginal response of the amenorrheic women was comparable to that of normally menstruating women. Subsequently, we showed that treatment with testosterone increased vaginal vasocongestion in the same amenorrheic women during exposure to the most potent visual stimulus but had no effect on subjective sexual experience. Testosterone substitution influenced physiological aspects of sexual function, but the psychological level remained unaffected.",

        "abstract": "Sexual function, including vaginal atrophy, and hormonal status, were studied in 42 naturally postmenopausal women. Vaginal pulse amplitude and subjective sexual responses during self-induced erotic fantasy and during erotic films were compared with responses of a small number of premenopausal women. As predicted, vaginal atrophy was related to estrogens but not to complaints of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. No significant relationship was found between hormones and sexual function. Unexpectedly, most of the few correlations that did reach significance involved prolactin. The fact that prolactin was negatively associated with sexual desire, sexual arousal and vaginal lubrication during sexual activity, suggests that psychosocial factors are more important than hormone levels in postmenopausal sexual function. Comparisons with a number of premenopausal women revealed that although postmenopausal women displayed lower vaginal pulse amplitude responses prior to erotic stimulation than the premenopausal women, this difference disappeared during subsequent erotic stimulation. We argued that this finding can be interpreted as being supportive of the notion that complaints of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia should not be attributed to vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. Rather, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia seem to reflect sexual arousal problems.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods are associated with many symptoms, including sexual complaints.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched for articles in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ISI Web of Knowledge and OpenGrey. The last search was performed in December 2012.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials comparing HT to either placebo or no intervention (control). We considered as HT estrogens alone; estrogens in combination with progestogens; synthetic steroids (for example tibolone); or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (for example raloxifene, bazedoxifene). Studies of other drugs possibly used in the relief of menopausal symptoms were excluded. We included studies that evaluated sexual function using any validated assessment tool. The primary outcome was a composite score for sexual function and the scores for individual domains (arousal and sexual interest, orgasm, and pain) were secondary outcomes. Studies were selected by two authors independently.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were independently extracted by two authors and checked by a third. Risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two authors. We contacted study investigators as required. Data were analysed using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risk (RR). We stratified the analysis by participant characteristics with regard to menopausal symptoms. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThe search retrieved 2351 records from which 27 studies (16,393 women) were included. The 'symptomatic or early post-menopausal' subgroup included nine studies: perimenopausal women (one study), up to 36 months postmenopause (one study), up to five years postmenopause (one study), experiencing vasomotor or other menopausal symptoms (five studies), or experiencing hot flushes and sexual dysfunction (one study). The 'unselected postmenopausal women' subgroup included 18 studies, which included women regardless of menopausal symptoms and permitted the inclusion of women with more than five years since the final menstrual period. No studies were restricted to women with sexual dysfunction. Only five studies evaluated sexual function as a primary outcome. Eighteen studies were deemed at high risk of bias, and the other nine studies were at unclear risk of bias. Twenty studies received commercial funding.Findings for sexual function (measured by composite score):For estrogens alone versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the SMD and 95% CI were compatible with a small to moderate benefit in sexual function for the HT group (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.54, P < 0.00001, 3 studies, 699 women, I\u00b2 = 55%, high-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.34, P = 0.08, 2 studies, 478 women, I\u00b2 = 44%, low-quality evidence). The subgroups were not pooled because of considerable heterogeneity.For estrogens combined with progestogens versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the 95% CI was compatible with a small to moderate benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64, P = 0.0003, 1 study, 335 women, moderate-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.20, P = 0.10, 3 studies, 1314 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The subgroups were not pooled because of considerable heterogeneity.For tibolone versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.26, P = 0.05, 1 study, 883 women, low-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a moderate benefit (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.71, P = 0.03, 2 studies, 142 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). In the combined analysis, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29, P = 0.008, 3 studies, 1025 women, I\u00b2 = 20%).For SERMs versus control, in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a moderate benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.50, P = 0.09, 1 study, 215 women, low-quality evidence). In unselected postmenopausal women, the 95% CI was compatible with small harm to a small benefit (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.29, P = 0.72, 1 study, 283 women, low-quality evidence). In the combined analysis, the 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.31, P = 0.16, 2 studies, 498 women, I\u00b2 = 2%).A comparison of SERMs combined with estrogens versus control was only evaluated in symptomatic or early postmenopausal women. The 95% CI was compatible with no effect to a small benefit for sexual function in the HT group (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.43, P = 0.05, 1 study, 542 women, moderate-quality evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nHT treatment with estrogens alone or in combination with progestogens was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, when used in women with menopausal symptoms or in early postmenopause (within five years of amenorrhoea), but not in unselected postmenopausal women. Evidence regarding other HTs (synthetic steroids and SERMs) is of low quality and we are uncertain of their effect on sexual function. The current evidence does not suggest an important effect of tibolone or of SERMs alone or combined with estrogens on sexual function. More studies evaluating the effect of synthetic steroids, SERMS and the association of SERM + estrogens would improve the quality of the evidence for the effect of these treatments on sexual function in peri and postmenopausal women. Future studies should also evaluate the effect of HT solely among women with sexual complaints.",

        "abstract": "Importance Sexual dysfunction, an important determinant of women\u2019s health and quality of life, is commonly associated with declining estrogen levels around the menopausal transition. Objective To determine the effects of oral or transdermal estrogen therapy vs placebo on sexual function in postmenopausal women. Design, Setting, and Participants Ancillary study of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), a 4-year prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of menopausal hormone therapy in healthy, recently menopausal women. Of 727 KEEPS enrollees, 670 agreed to participate in this multicenter ancillary study. Women were 42 to 58 years old, within 36 months from last menstrual period. Data were collected from July 2005 through June 2008 and analyzed from July 2010 through June 2017. Interventions Women were randomized to either 0.45 mg/d oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE), 50 \u00b5g/d transdermal 17&bgr;-estradiol (t-E2), or placebo. Participants also received 200 mg oral micronized progesterone (if randomized to o-CEE or t-E2) or placebo (if randomized to placebo estrogens) for 12 days each month. Main Outcomes and Measures Aspects of sexual function and experience (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) were assessed using the Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI; range, 0-36 points; higher scores indicate better sexual function). Low sexual function (LSF) was defined as an FSFI overall score of less than 26.55. Distress related to low FSFI score (required for the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction) was not evaluated. Results The 670 participants had a mean (SD) age of 52.7 (2.6) years. The t-E2 treatment was associated with a significant yet moderate improvement in the FSFI overall score across all time points compared with placebo (average efficacy, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.11-4.10; adjusted P\u2009=\u2009.002). With o-CEE treatment, there was no significant difference in FSFI overall score compared with placebo (mean efficacy, 1.4; 95% CI, \u22120.1 to 2.8; adjusted P\u2009=\u2009.13). There was no difference in FSFI overall score between the t-E2 and o-CEE groups on average across 48 months (adjusted P\u2009=\u2009.22). In the individual domains of sexual function, t-E2 treatment was associated with a significant increase in mean lubrication (0.61; 95% CI, 0.25-0.97; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and decreased pain (0.67; 95% CI, 0.25-1.09; P\u2009=\u2009.002) compared with placebo. Overall, the proportion of women with LSF was significantly lower after t-E2 treatment compared with placebo (67%; 95% CI, 55%-77% vs 76%; 95% CI, 67%-83%; P\u2009=\u2009.04). For o-CEE there was no significant reduction in the odds of LSF.

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) was designed to address gaps in understanding the effects of timely menopausal hormone treatments (HT) on cardiovascular health and other effects of menopause after the premature termination of the Women's Health Initiative. Method: The KEEPS was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that initiation of HT (oral conjugated equine estrogens [o-CEE] or transdermal 17\u03b2-estradiol [t-E2]) in healthy, recently postmenopausal women (n\u200a=\u200a727) would slow the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). Results: After 4 years, neither HT affected the rate of increase in CIMT. There was a trend for reduced accumulation of coronary artery calcium with o-CEE. There were no severe adverse effects, including venous thrombosis. Several ancillary studies demonstrated a positive effect on mood with o-CEE, and reduced hot flashes, improved sleep, and maintenance of bone mineral density with both treatments. Sexual function improved with t-E2. There were no significant effects of either treatment on cognition, breast pain, or skin wrinkling. Variants of genes associated with estrogen metabolism influenced the age of menopause and variability in effects of the HT on CIMT. Platelet activation associated with the development of white matter hyperintensities in the brain. Conclusions: KEEPS and its ancillary studies have supported the value and safety of the use of HT in recently postmenopausal women and provide a perspective for future research to optimize HT and health of postmenopausal women.

        "abstract": "Background Yin Huo Tang (YHT), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, is effectively used for the clinical treatment of menopause-like symptoms in China. This study aimed to investigate its efficacy on menopause-like symptoms in mice using behavioral tests and histopathological assessment, and to determine its possible mechanism of action based on network pharmacology. Methods Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology was used to identify the potential active ingredients of YHT. In mice, menopause-like symptoms were induced by combination of bilateral ovariectomy and empty bottle stimulation. The mice were then treated with the YHT aqueous extract for three weeks. Behavior, sleep state, body weight, organ index, and histomorphology were analyzed separately. Additionally, network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to predict the mechanisms underlying the action of YHT. Finally, serum estradiol was quantified to preliminarily verify the results of network pharmacology. Results YHT not only improved the behavior of mice (attack and explore behavior reduced; modify behavior increased) but also ameliorated the sleep state (sleep time increased and incubation time reduced). YHT reduced body weight, increased uterine weight, and improved the histomorphology of some organs. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses revealed that the estrogen signaling pathway might play a key role in attenuating menopause-like symptoms. Furthermore, YHT treatment reversed the reduction in serum estradiol levels. Conclusions YHT alleviates menopause-like symptoms in a mouse model, providing a rationale for using it as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

        "title": "Serum Adropin Levels and Body Mass Composition in Kidney Transplant Recipients\u2014Are There Sex Differences?",
        "abstract": "Adropin is a secretory peptide that regulates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, which is closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherogenesis. The serum adropin level is related to sex and depends upon nutritional preferences. This study aims to determine the association between serum adropin levels and body composition parameters in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), especially emphasizing sex differences. Our case\u2013control study involved 59 KTRs (28 postmenopausal women and 31 men) who were divided into two groups according to sex, and each group of those KTRs was further divided into higher or lower adropin values than the mean value in each sex group. Univariate regression showed a negative association of adropin levels with most anthropometric and body composition parameters in men\u2019s KTRs. Contrary to this, the serum adropin level was negatively associated only with phase angle in postmenopausal female KTRs. Multivariate regression showed that skeletal muscle mass and phase angle were the only negative predictors in women\u2019s KTRs, whereas in men, negative predictors were BMI and body water. These findings imply that adropin could have a different impact on metabolic homeostasis in KTRs regarding sex and could be considered a negative predictor of body composition in KTRs.",
