        "title": "Randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of low-dose oral methotrexate in children with extended oligoarticular or systemic arthritis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can persist through adolescence and adulthood, resulting in significant disability. The use of low-dose oral methotrexate (MTX) for persistent polyarthritis has been shown to be effective by the USA/USSR collaborative study group. However, 2 of the most disabling subgroups of JIA, systemic and extended oligoarthritis, were underrepresented in that study. The present study was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of MTX in these 2 subgroups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients under the age of 16 years who fulfilled the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria for systemic or extended oligoarticular arthritis were eligible for this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Forty-five patients with systemic and 43 with extended oligoarticular arthritis were enrolled. The dosage of MTX or placebo was 15 mg/m2, which could be increased to 20 mg/m2 after 2 months. Core outcome variables were considered as primary measures, giving a final score of \"improved\" or \"not improved.\" Secondary measures included scores of systemic features and biochemical laboratory measures. Assessment of function was not included since there were no validated functional measures at the start of this trial in 1991.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the extended oligoarticular arthritis group, MTX treatment produced significant improvement in 3 of 5 core variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, physician's global assessment of disease activity, and parent's global assessment of disease activity). By the primary improvement criteria, there was significant overall improvement during MTX treatment. In the systemic arthritis group, only 2 of 5 core variables were significantly improved (physician's and parent's global assessment of disease activity). Systemic features were not part of the core variables, but the systemic feature score was not significantly different between MTX and placebo treatment. There was no significant overall improvement in this group during MTX treatment. However, no significant interaction between disease subgroup and treatment effect was demonstrated. When the data from both disease subgroups were combined, there was significant clinical improvement during MTX treatment (P = 0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMTX 15-20 mg/m2 given orally once a week was found to be an effective treatment for both extended oligoarticular and systemic JIA in this shortterm trial. Long-term efficacy needs to be addressed in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate hepatotoxicity in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) receiving methotrexate (MTX) therapy with doses of 20-30 mg/m2 of body surface area.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe graded the histology of percutaneous liver biopsies from 34 patients with JIA receiving longterm (> 2.4 years) MTX therapy at the Rheumatism Foundation Hospital, Heinola, Finland, using the Roenigk classification scale. Medical records of the patients with JIA were retrospectively analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 10 patients with MTX doses >/= 20 mg/m2, 4 had grade II, 5 had grade I histology, and one specimen with extensive steatosis as the only pathologic finding could not be classified. All 24 patients treated with low dose MTX had grade I histology. No specimen showed fibrosis or cirrhosis. In 2 patients with grade II histology, extensive portal tract inflammation resolved when MTX was discontinued for 6 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAggressive medical treatment of JIA with MTX at 20-30 mg/m2 with concomitant disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and corticosteroids may contribute to minor liver abnormalities that seem to be reversible.",

        "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although associated with many mild adverse effects, the short and long-term safety of MTX in JIA has been excellent. While many JIA children treated with MTX develop liver enzyme abnormalities, no cases of irreversible liver damage or of severe non-infectious hepatitis with Reye-like features have been reported in non-systemic JIA. We report a 2-year-old girl with oligoarthritis whose liver enzyme increased to greater than 45 times the upper limit of normal, and developed hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia after 10 months of MTX and naproxen therapy. An infectious and metabolic work-up for other causes was unremarkable. She recovered completely after folinic acid therapy; MTX and naproxen was not restarted. While very rare in JIA, MTX in synergism with naproxen can induce severe liver toxicity and it is important to screen children for liver enzyme abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nKawasaki disease (kDa) is an immune-mediated vasculitis of childhood with multi-organ inflammation. We determined the risk of subsequent immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), including arthritis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune liver disease (ALD), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a matched population-based cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Children aged <18\u2009years born between 1991-2016 diagnosed with kDa (n\u2009=\u20093,753) were matched to 5 non-kDa controls from the general population (n\u2009=\u200918\u2009749). We determined the incidence of IMIDs after resolution of kDa. Three- and 12-month washout periods were used to exclude kDa-related symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was an elevated risk of arthritis in kDa patients compared with non-kDa controls starting three months after index date (103.0 vs 12.7 per 100\u2009000 person-years (PYs); incidence rate ratio (IRR) 8.07 (95% CI 4.95-13.2); hazard ratio (HR) 8.08 (95% CI 4.95-13.2), resulting in the overall incidence of IMIDs being elevated in kDa patients (175.1 vs 68.0 per 100\u2009000 PYs; IRR 2.58 (95% CI 1.93-3.43); HR 2.58, 95% CI 1.94-3.43). However, there was no increased risk for diabetes, IBD, ALD, PSC or MS in kDa patients. Similar results were observed using a 12-month washout period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren diagnosed with kDa were at increased risk of arthritis following the acute kDa event, but not other IMIDs. Health care providers should monitor for arthritis in children following a diagnosis of kDa.",

        "title": "Upregulated Expression of IL2RB Causes Disorder of Immune Microenvironment in Patients with Kawasaki Disease",
        "abstract": "Aims The clinical diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) is not easy because of many atypical manifestations. This study is aimed at finding potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for KD and analysing their correlation with immune cell infiltrations. Methods First, we downloaded the KD dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and used R software to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and perform functional correlation analysis. Then, CIBERSORT algorithm was used to evaluate immune cell infiltrations in samples. Coexpression analysis between DEGs and infiltrating immune cells was performed to screen the main infiltrating immune cells. Subsequently, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression analysis was used to screen the core genes related to KD. Finally, correlation analysis between the core genes and the main infiltrating immune cells was performed. Results 327 DEGs were screened out in this study. Among them, 72 shared genes were the category of genes most likely to be disease-causing for they did not change before and after treatment. After analysis, it was found that expression level of IL2RB in KD tissues was significantly upregulated, the number of resting CD4+ memory T cells was decreased, and the decrease was significantly negatively correlated with the upregulated expression of IL2RB. Therefore, it was speculated that the upregulated expression of IL2RB disrupted Th1/Th2 cell differentiation balance, which led to a decrease of resting CD4+ memory T cells and finally caused disorder of immune microenvironment in patients with KD. Conclusions Upregulated expression of IL2RB leads to disorder of immune microenvironment in patients with KD and eventually causes the occurrence and development of KD. Therefore, IL2RB may serve as a diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target for KD.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of Kawasaki disease (KD) complicated with hip synovitis. Methods Children with KD admitted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020, in the KD database of Yuying Children's Hospital Affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University were retrospectively included. We selected KD children with hip synovitis as the case group and KD children without hip synovitis as the control group to analyze the possible risk factors of hip synovitis in KD children. Results Among 2,871\u2005KD children admitted to our center in recent years, 28 had hip synovitis. In this study 140\u2005KD children were enrolled, including 28\u2005KD children with hip synovitis and 112 children with general KD (within one month of admission). The onset age of KD patients with hip synovitis was 30.92 (23.23\u201349.99) months, and there were 17 cases of bilateral hip involvement. The course of synovitis (limited movement, joint pain, lameness, unwillingness to stand, etc.) ranged from 1 to 19 days, with an average of (8.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6) days. We treated all KD children with IVIG (Intravenous immunoglobulin) plus aspirin, among which five patients in the case group developed coronary artery damage, six acquired IVIG resistance, and synovial inflammation disappeared within two weeks. Age, weight, length of stay, and incidence of IVIG resistance significantly differed between the two groups (P\u2009=\u20090.001, 0.005, <0.001, and 0.035, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that KD combined with hip synovitis was an independent risk factor for developing propyl pellet resistance, with an OR value of 4.625 (95% CI: 1.095, 19.526). Conclusion KD combined with hip synovitis mainly involves bilateral hip joints, and joint pain and limited movement are the main clinical features. The symptoms are mild and self-limiting. KD combined with hip synovitis is a risk factor for IVIG resistance. Hip synovitis is a good predictor of IVIG resistance.",
