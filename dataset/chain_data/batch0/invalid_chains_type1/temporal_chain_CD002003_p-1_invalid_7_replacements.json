        "title": "Beta-blockers versus diuretics in hypertensive men: main results from the HAPPHY trial.",
        "abstract": "Men aged 40-64 years with mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100-130 mmHg] were randomized to treatment with a diuretic (n = 3272) or a beta-blocker (n = 3297), with additional drugs if necessary, to determine whether a beta-blocker based treatment differs from thiazide diuretic based treatment with regard to the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Patients with previous CHD, stroke or other serious diseases, or with contraindications to diuretics or beta-blockers were excluded. If normotension (DBP less than 95 mmHg) was not achieved by monotherapy, other antihypertensive drugs were added, but the two basic drugs were not crossed over. Patients were assessed at 6-monthly intervals. The mean follow-up for end-points was 45.1 months. Blood pressure (BP) side effects and end-points were recorded in a standardized manner. Entry characteristics and the BP reduction achieved were very similar in both treatment groups. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. The incidence of CHD did not differ between the two treatment groups. The incidence of fatal stroke tended to be lower in the beta-blocker treated group than in the diuretic treated group. Total mortality and the total number of end-points were similar in both groups. The percentage of patients withdrawn due to side effects was similar, whereas the number of reported symptoms, according to a questionnaire, was higher for patients on beta-blockers. The incidence of diabetes did not differ between the two groups. Subgroup analyses did not detect a difference in the effect of beta-blockers compared with diuretics in smokers as opposed to non-smokers, and beta-blockers also had the same effects as diuretics in the quartile with the highest predicted risk for CHD. Beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics were approximately equally well tolerated. The two drugs had a similar BP reducing effect although additional drugs had to be given more often in the diuretic group. Antihypertensive treatment based on a beta-blocker or on a thiazide diuretic could not be shown to affect the prevention of hypertensive complications, including CHD, to a different extent.",

Cases were patients who had high blood pressure treated with medicines and who presented in 1982 to 1984 with angina or fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Controls were a probability sample of health maintenance organization patients with pharmacologically treated hypertension and free of coronary heart disease. Blinded to case-control status, we reviewed the medical records of the 248 cases and 737 controls. The health maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database was used to ascertain the use of \u03b2-blockers. Fewer cases than controls were taking \u03b2-blockers. This difference was confined to those with nonfatal infarctions. After adjustment for confounding, the estimated relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.99). Higher doses of \u03b2-blockers conferred greater protection. We conclude that \u03b2-blockers may prevent first events of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with high blood pressure.

        "title": "Multivariate refutation of aetiological hypotheses in non-experimental epidemiology.",
        "abstract": "Extension of Karl Popper's logic of refutation from the realm of contingency tables to multivariate modelling leads to the conclusion that rigorously scientific multivariate analysis in non-experimental epidemiology differs from the traditional quasi-scientific approach. Instead of aiming for high sensitivity in detecting aetiological agents, the goal in refutation is high specificity--to give the best defence of the 'innocence' of every exposure hypothesized as being a cause. Instead of 'forward selection' or 'backward elimination', multivariate refutation uses the method of 'forward elimination'. This entails a likelihood approach (which may be complemented by, but should be demarcated from, Bayesian methods) not only for statistical inference but also, by analogy, for study design and conduct: one starts with the conclusion (the estimate or hypothesis) and works backwards to the observations (the likelihood of the data or the design of the study). Differences in practice can sometimes be large, as illustrated by a study of hypothesized triggers of myocardial infarction. Multivariate refutation should replace the concept of multivariate modelling in non-experimental epidemiology.",

        "abstract": "We assessed the medical outcomes and costs associated with the pharmacologic treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in a population-based historical cohort study of patients enrolled in a health maintenance organization. For up to 2 years, we compared 58 patients who used therapeutic amounts of pentoxifylline with a comparison group of 112 patients who received a minimal subefficacious trial of pentoxifylline. Medical records data were used to assess and control for the severity of PAD and other potentially confounding factors. Continuous use of a therapeutic amount of pentoxifylline during an initial 120-day period significantly reduced the incidence of PAD-related invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures in the first year of follow-up (adjusted relative risk, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.99). However, there were no significant differences in the risk of a PAD-related hospitalization or cost of PAD-related care between continuous pentoxifylline users and the comparison group. Pentoxifylline therapy may reduce the risk of vascular surgery while not increasing the total cost of PAD care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNoncompliance with medications is one of the most serious problems facing health care today. However, methods to measure compliance have many limitations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo measure specific drug compliance and dosing frequency of two asthma medications, we used medical records data and pharmacy claims data from 276 patients who had concurrent prescriptions for inhaled anti-inflammatory agents and oral theophylline. Patients were randomly selected from the pharmacy claims data files of a health maintenance organization. The patients' medical records were reviewed, and records that did not contain clear documentation of the medication, dose, and dosing frequency were excluded. Data from the remaining 119 medical records were compared with data from pharmacy claims to calculate compliance rates for each medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur calculations showed that patients were significantly more compliant with prescribed theophylline medication than with two inhaled anti-inflammatory medications (P = .0001). No significant differences in compliance were found relative to prescribed dosing frequency (twice daily or less compared with three times daily or more) for either medication (P = .6517).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nComparison of medical record data with pharmacy claims data is an effective indirect measure of patients' compliance with prescribed oral theophylline and inhaled anti-inflammatory agents. Additional interventions must be pursued for patients with asthma regarding adherence to regimens for their prescribed inhaled anti-inflammatory agents.",

        "abstract": "Objective To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of zafirlukast. Therapeutic issues regarding the use of a leukotriene-receptor antagonist as prophylactic antiinflammatory therapy for asthma are also discussed. Data Sources A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. Pharmacokinetic and dosing information were abstracted from the product labeling. Study Selection All available published articles describing double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of both oral and aerosol zafirlukast in patients with asthma or rhinitis were reviewed. These included single-dose studies with zafirlukast against exercise, allergen, leukotriene D4 (LTD4), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) challenges, and 6- and 13-week trials in patients with asthma. Studies describing clinical trials with long-term use or comparisons with other asthma medications as reported in abstracts are also included. Data Extraction Information on the safety and efficacy of zafirlukast from single- and multiple-dose studies was evaluated on the basis of statistical significance relative to placebo treatment. Data Synthesis Zafirlukast, a potent and selective antagonist of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, blocks leukotriene-mediated pathologic events in both experimental animal and clinical disease models. Zafirlukast antagonizes LTD4-, PAF-, and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and blocks both early- and late-phase responses following allergen provocation in patients with atopic asthma. Greater efficacy is noted following oral administration than with aerosol dosing, presumably because of the enhanced delivery of drug when ingested rather than inhaled. Conclusions Zafirlukast is the first orally active leukotriene-receptor antagonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prophylactic and chronic treatment of asthma. Since the leukotrienes play an important role in the underlying inflammatory processes of asthma, zafirlukast represents a new antiinflammatory option available in an oral dosage form. It is clear that this agent has therapeutic activity in patients with asthma, but its effectiveness relative to other antiasthma medications still needs confirmation. Data from clinical studies support the use of zafirlukast as first-line therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. Further research is needed to establish its role as an add-on agent for patients with severe asthma, aspirin-sensitive asthma, and both allergies and asthma. In addition to having a favorable safety and efficacy profile, zafirlukast has the advantage of being an oral agent with twice-daily dosing; these attributes offer the potential for greater patient adherence to pharmacotherapy and, thereby, improved control of asthma symptoms.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the health care resource utilization between adult asthma patients in managed care organizations with those in indemnity plans using an episodes of care methodology. We also examined the importance of risk adjustment in explaining variation in resource utilization. Episodes were constructed using private insurance claims from 1992 to 1993. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine differences between managed care and indemnity plans on episode severity, resource utilization, and outcome measures (asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits). Managed care plans showed higher resource utilization in terms of services and payments per episode compared with fee-for-service plans. Financial incentives to both providers and patients may have contributed to the higher utilization among managed care patients. An episodes of care methodology has potential to serve as a cost-effective \"tool\" in analyzing trends in medical care utilization within a health care plan. Validation of this methodology is necessary, however, before it can be used to compare trends in utilization across health plans.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Written information can be a valuable tool in patient education. Studies evaluating written information for various disease states have frequently demonstrated that the majority of literature is written at a readability level that exceeds that of the average patient, and it has been recommended that written communications for adult patients should be provided at a fifth-grade level or lower. OBJECTIVE: To assess the readability of printed patient information available to patients with epilepsy. METHODS: Samples of written patient information (n = 101) were obtained from various sources. The information was classified based on source, content, and intended audience, and readability was assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and Flesch\u2014Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) score. RESULTS: The mean FRES and FKGL score for all samples were 50.2 and 9.4, respectively. Significant differences were observed in both the FRES and FKGL score of material obtained from different sources; however, no differences were observed when material was analyzed according to content. The mean FRES and FKGL score for materials intended for adults were 49.6 and 9.5, respectively. In comparison, mean FRES and FKGL scores for materials intended for children/adolescents were 78.9 and 5.3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of information tested was written at a level that exceeds the reading ability of many patients. The information intended for children is actually written at the appropriate level for an adult. Efforts should be taken to develop written teaching tools that target low-level readers, especially for a disease state that affects many children.",

        "abstract": "Background: There has been an increasing drive from consumers for more information to be available about their medicines. However, the layout and presentation of such written information is variable, and the poor format and design discourages people from reading the documents. Objective: To identify, collate, and evaluate different formats of written medicine information (WMI). Methods: Three researchers evaluated 157 samples of WMI for 10 prescription and 3 over-the-counter medicines from 6 English-speaking countries compared with the United States Keystone Consensus Criterion 8 (USKCC8) and the Ten Key Principles (TKP) of Consumer Medicine Information. Readability was measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Fog tests. Compliance (%) with the criteria was computed and examined using the median test. Results: Overall median compliance with USKCC8 was 70%, and 74% to TKP. New Zealand leaflets achieved the highest compliance with USKCC8 (83%, Interquartile range (IQR) 70\u201389%), with US leaflets the lowest (55%. IQR 45\u201370%). Australian and New Zealand leaflets showed the highest compliance with TKP (90%, IQR 80\u2013100% and 87\u201397%, respectively), while UK leaflets demonstrated the lowest (60%, IQR 52\u201371%). Overall median reading grades for the leaflets were 10 (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) and 11 (Fog). Conclusions: Compliance with USKCC8 and TKP varied greatly between countries, with readability grades exceeding the recommended range. International examples of WMI show wide variation in compliance with guidelines on recommended format and presentation. These examples of WMI require high literacy to read. Future WMI development should use more recommended formats and increase comprehensibility.",

A 17-item questionnaire was designed to assess three aspects: knowledge, beliefs and behaviours related to medicine safety. A total of 740 questionnaires were distributed in three representative governorates of Oman. Median total scores for the three sections were estimated. Associations with participants' demographic variables and medication histories were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 618 participants completed the survey (response rate: 83.5%). Many participants (46.4%) believed that side-effects occurred only with high doses of medication and over 30% believed that they did not occur at all with traditional and over-the-counter medicines.

        "title": "Users\u2019 Knowledge About Adverse Effects of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs in Tirana, Albania",
        "abstract": "Aim: To assess the level of knowledge of the adult users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regarding their side effects and the socio-demographic factors associated with the use of these drugs in the adult population of Albania. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including a representative sample of 199 individuals aged \u226518 years (77% women; overall mean age: 30.3\u00b110.0 years; overall response rate: 90%) who were users of NSAIDs recruited in ten different pharmacies in Tirana municipality during April-May 2015. A self-administered questionnaire contained basic socio-demographic information and questions about NSAIDs use, their types, participants\u2019 knowledge about NSAIDs side effects and their interaction with other drugs. Results: In 56% of the cases, NSAIDs were taken by participants\u2019 own decisions, whereas in about 29% of the cases these drugs were prescribed by physicians. Acetaminophen, ketoprofen and ibuprofen were the most frequently used NSAIDs. Overall, 51% of participants thought NSAIDs could cause allergic reactions, whereas one third or fewer were aware of each of the following side effects: upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, gastritis, kidney failure, myopathy, osteoporosis. About one third of participants were aware of NSAIDs-other drug interactions, whereas some of them were already taking contraindicated drugs. No significant differences were noticed regarding sex, age, educational level, employment status and marital status, with very few exceptions. Conclusion: Our findings indicate limited knowledge about NSAIDs side effects and their interaction with other drugs among the Albania adult population, which is a cause of concern.",

        "title": "Knowledge of patients on safe medication use in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed and used medications that are used as analgesic, antipyretic, or anti-inflammatory agents, but have a high risk of adverse effects. Objective: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the knowledge of patients toward the risks and safe usage of NSAIDs. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who attended orthopedic clinics at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during December 2017 to February 2018. A self-administered questionnaire comprising three sections [sociodemographic information, patients' knowledge of NSAIDs, and the attitude toward receiving information about NSAIDs' adverse drug reactions (ADRs)] was used. The attitude was measured with a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The mean duration of NSAIDs usage was 7.3 \u00b1 6.9 years. Only 45% of the respondents used NSAIDs daily, while 38% said they only used NSAIDs as needed. Nearly one-quarter of patients (25.5%) were counseled by a healthcare provider on the risks of NSAIDs. Almost 94% and 90.5% of the study subjects agreed that physicians and pharmacists, respectively, should play an essential role in providing information regarding ADRs to their patients. More than half of the respondents claimed that information about ADRs might lead them to discontinue their medicines. More than one-third of respondents stated that their healthcare setting provided them with insufficient knowledge of ADRs. Conclusion: Counseling of patients may diminish potentially inappropriate use and increase risk awareness. Healthcare providers can improve their role in identifying and counseling patients on NSAIDs.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the community pharmacists\u2019 performance in the screening of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs risks in Saudi Arabia",
        "abstract": "Objectives: To assess community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and practices regarding screening risk factors and providing safety information about the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to patients. Methods: Cross-sectional and a self-administered questionnaire-based study was conducted over a 4-month period (May-August 2019) with selected community pharmacies in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire composed of demographic data and the pharmacist\u2019s role in supplying NSAIDs. Results: The majority of participating community pharmacists dispense NSAIDs. However, many did not apply relevantly good communication skills such as seeking information about concomitant drugs (42.5%) or providing advice on managing any adverse side effects of taking NSAIDs (39.1%). Most of the community pharmacists also did not provide relevantly good communication about risk factors. The most common screening risk factors mentioned were a history of pregnancy and breastfeeding (84.2%) followed by being at an older age (74.5%) or a history of a gastrointestinal ulcer (71.5%). Conclusion: Community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia need to appropriately screen their patients for adverse drug reactions and effectively communicate the risks of using NSAIDs. The Saudi Regulatory Authority could endorse several approaches to apply a good strategy for improving the dispensing practices in community pharmacies, communication and awareness of risk factors especially in high-risk patients who are taking NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Background Pain is a global health issue that affects an individual\u2019s quality of life. Its alleviation and management will enhance patients\u2019 experience. Community pharmacists can help manage pain severity through their valuable roles in medical teams and by managing the consequences of pain. Objective This study aimed to evaluate community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and attitudes toward pain and pain management in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and attitudes toward pain and pain management in Saudi Arabia. Pharmacists aged \u2265 21 years, with a degree in pharmacy were included in this study. Each respondent participated in an online survey covering cancer-oriented pain and assessment of pain; pharmacology; abuse of substances; and physical dependence. An independent t-test and One-way ANOVA, with least significant difference as a post-hoc test, were employed, in addition to the General Linear Regression Model using Main Effect as the model. Results This study revealed that the pain-related knowledge and attitude among community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia were inadequate. Age (p = 0.003), work experience (p = 0.036), nature of work (p = 0.001), and work location (p = 0.003) were determined as significant factors affecting their overall knowledge and attitude toward pain. Conclusion Overall, attempts to expand community pharmacists\u2019 knowledge and foster an appropriate attitude toward pain management among them in Saudi Arabia are highly recommended. Additional academic courses, studies, and tailored neuroscience courses will improve their awareness and knowledge of pain and pain management.",

        "abstract": "Background: Analgesics are frequently used to manage pain, and community pharmacists play a crucial role in prescribing these medications. However, inappropriate prescribing patterns and inadequate pharmacological knowledge of analgesics among pharmacists can lead to adverse health outcomes and increase healthcare costs. Aim: Eevaluating the prescribing patterns and pharmacological knowledge of analgesics among community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia. The study also seeks to identify any potential areas of deficiency in the knowledge or practices of community pharmacists regarding the safe and effective use of analgesics. Ultimately, to enhance the quality of care provided to patients who require analgesic therapy, by addressing any gaps in the knowledge or practices of community pharmacists. Method: In November 2022, a study was conducted in Jeddah to investigate the prescribing skills and level of pharmacological knowledge of analgesics among community pharmacists. The research design used for this study was cross-sectional. Results: One hundred thirty fours community pharmacists responded to the survey. Most participants were male, 31 years old or above, with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Pharmacy. Most of the community pharmacists were aware of the correct use, side effects or complications, contraindications, safe dosage, and reaction mechanism of analgesics. The community pharmacists obtained a favorable mean knowledge score (> 50%) of analgesic drugs. Conclusion: Community pharmacists reported correct prescribing patterns and adequate pharmacological knowledge. However, when pharmacists have little community experience their analgesic drug knowledge tends to be weaker, but it becomes stronger after 5 years.",
