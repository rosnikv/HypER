        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between second and third trimester glycemic control and adverse outcomes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, as uncertainty exists about optimum glycemic targets. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Pregnancy outcomes were assessed prospectively in 725 women with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes and Pre-eclampsia Intervention Trial. HbA1c (A1C) values at 26 and 34 weeks\u2019 gestation were categorized into five groups, the lowest, <6.0% (42 mmol/mol), being the reference. Average pre- and postprandial results from an eight-point capillary glucose profile the previous day were categorized into five groups, the lowest (preprandial <5.0 mmol/L and postprandial <6.0 mmol/L) being the reference. RESULTS An A1C of 6.0\u20136.4% (42\u201347 mmol/mol) at 26 weeks\u2019 gestation was associated with a significantly increased risk of large for gestational age (LGA) (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0\u20133.0]) and an A1C of 6.5\u20136.9% (48\u201352 mmol/mol) with a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.3\u20134.8]), pre-eclampsia (4.3 [1.7\u201310.8]), need for a neonatal glucose infusion (2.9 [1.5\u20135.6]), and a composite adverse outcome (3.2 [1.3\u20138.0]). These risks increased progressively with increasing A1C. Results were similar at 34 weeks\u2019 gestation. Glucose data showed less consistent trends, although the risk of a composite adverse outcome increased with preprandial glucose levels between 6.0 and 6.9 mmol/L at 34 weeks (3.3 [1.3\u20138.0]). CONCLUSIONS LGA increased significantly with an A1C \u22656.0 (42 mmol/mol) at 26 and 34 weeks' gestation and with other adverse outcomes with an A1C \u22656.5% (48 mmol/mol). The data suggest that there is clinical utility in regular measurement of A1C during pregnancy.",

Paternal PPD occurs later postpartum in men than in women, and results in father/infant bonding issues, may lead to long term effects for the child, and has detrimental effects on the couple\u2019s relationship. Risk factors of paternal PPD include the mother having PPD, the father having a history of depression, being under 25, and being unmarried.

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of dual sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Design Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Medline; Cochrane Library; Embase; international meeting abstracts; international and national clinical trial registries; and websites of US, European, and Japanese regulatory authorities, up to 10 January 2019. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of sotagliflozin versus active comparators or placebo on glycaemic and non-glycaemic outcomes and on adverse events in type 1 diabetes in participants older than 18. Three reviewers extracted data for study characteristics, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias and summarised strength of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. Main outcomes were pooled using random effects models. Results Of 739 records identified, six randomised placebo controlled trials (n=3238, duration 4-52 weeks) were included. Sotagliflozin reduced levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; weighted mean difference \u22120.34% (95% confidence interval \u22120.41% to \u22120.27%), P<0.001); fasting plasma glucose (\u221216.98 mg/dL, \u221222.1 to \u221211.9; 1 mg/dL=0.0555 mmol/L) and two hour-postprandial plasma glucose (\u221239.2 mg/dL, \u221250.4 to \u221228.1); and daily total, basal, and bolus insulin dose (\u22128.99%, \u221210.93% to \u22127.05%; \u22128.03%, \u221210.14% to \u22125.93%; \u22129.14%, \u221212.17% to \u22126.12%; respectively). Sotagliflozin improved time in range (weighted mean difference 9.73%, 6.66% to 12.81%) and other continuous glucose monitoring parameters, and reduced body weight (\u22123.54%, \u22123.98% to \u22123.09%), systolic blood pressure (\u22123.85 mm Hg, \u22124.76 to \u22122.93), and albuminuria (albumin:creatinine ratio \u221214.57 mg/g, \u221226.87 to \u22122.28). Sotagliflozin reduced hypoglycaemia (weighted mean difference \u22129.09 events per patient year, \u221213.82 to \u22124.36) and severe hypoglycaemia (relative risk 0.69, 0.49 to 0.98). However, the drug increased the risk of ketoacidosis (relative risk 3.93, 1.94 to 7.96), genital tract infections (3.12, 2.14 to 4.54), diarrhoea (1.50, 1.08 to 2.10), and volume depletion events (2.19, 1.10 to 4.36). Initial HbA1c and basal insulin dose adjustment were associated with the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. A sotagliflozin dose of 400 mg/day was associated with a greater improvement in most glycaemic and non-glycaemic outcomes than the 200 mg/day dose, without increasing the risk of adverse events. The quality of evidence was high to moderate for most outcomes, but low for major adverse cardiovascular events and all cause death. The relatively short duration of trials prevented assessment of long term outcomes. Conclusions In type 1 diabetes, sotagliflozin improves glycaemic and non-glycaemic outcomes and reduces hypoglycaemia rate and severe hypoglycaemia. The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis could be minimised by appropriate patient selection and down-titration of the basal insulin dose.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ultra-rapid insulin Fiasp\u00ae in the hybrid closed-loop MiniMed\u2122 670G system. METHODS This was a pilot randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study among established MiniMed\u2122 670G users comparing percent time in range (TIR) and hypoglycemia for Novolog\u00ae and Fiasp\u00ae. Following two weeks optimization with their home insulin, participants were randomized to receive Novolog\u00ae or Fiasp\u00ae for two weeks, followed by the other insulin for the next two weeks. Data from the second week of blinded insulin use was analyzed to allow one week for 670G adaptation. During the second week, individuals were asked to eat the same breakfast for three days to assess differences in meal pharmacodynamics. RESULTS Nineteen adults were recruited with mean age of 40\u00b118 years, diabetes duration of 27\u00b112 years and median HbA1c of 7.1 (6.9,7.5)%, using 0.72 (0.4,1.2) units/kg/day. For Novolog\u00ae and Fiasp\u00ae respectively the %TIR (70-180mg/dL) was 75.3\u00b19.5 and 78.4 \u00b19.3; %time <70mg/dL was 3.1\u00b12.1 and 2.3\u00b12.0; %time >180mg/dL was 21.6\u00b19.0 and 19.3\u00b18.9; mean glucose was 147\u00b112 and 146\u00b112mg/dL; coefficient of variation was 28.6\u00b14.5% and 26.8\u00b14.4%; %time in Auto Mode 86.4\u00b19.2 and 84.4\u00b19.2. All comparisons were non-significant for insulin type. Total daily dose (Novolog\u00ae 48.8\u00b128.4 vs. Fiasp\u00ae 52.4\u00b131.7 units; p=0.01) and daily basal (Novolog\u00ae 17.6 (15.5,33.8) vs. Fiasp\u00ae 19.1 (15.3,38.5) units; p=0.07) correlated with TIR and %time >180mg/dL. For insulin delivery in Auto Mode there was no statistical difference in total daily dose or daily basal between arms. Paired analysis for matched breakfast meals revealed no significant differences in time to maximum glucose, peak glucose or glucose excursion. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study the use of either Novolog\u00ae or Fiasp\u00ae in a commercially available MiniMed\u2122 670G system operating in Auto Mode resulted in clinically similar glycemic outcomes, with a slight increase in daily insulin requirements using Fiasp\u00ae.",

A total of 41\u202f753 participants with insulin-treated diabetes (5673 type 1; 36\u202f080 type 2) receiving care from a Northern California integrated health care delivery system (2014-2019), being treated with insulin, self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, and having no prior CGM use were included.\n\n\nExposures\nInitiation vs noninitiation of real-time CGM (reference group).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nTen end points measured during the 12 months before and 12 months after baseline: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); hypoglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); hyperglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); HbA1c levels lower than 7%, lower than 8%, and higher than 9%; 1 emergency department encounter or more for any reason; 1 hospitalization or more for any reason; and number of outpatient visits and telephone visits.\n\n\nResults\nThe real-time CGM initiators included 3806 patients (mean age, 42.4 years [SD, 19.9 years]; 51% female; 91% type 1, 9% type 2); the noninitiators included 37\u202f947 patients (mean age, 63.4 years [SD, 13.4 years]; 49% female; 6% type 1, 94% type 2). The prebaseline mean HbA1c was lower among real-time CGM initiators than among noninitiators, but real-time CGM initiators had higher prebaseline rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c declined among real-time CGM initiators from 8.17% to 7.76% and from 8.28% to 8.19% among noninitiators (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.48% to -0.32%; P\u2009<\u2009.001).
