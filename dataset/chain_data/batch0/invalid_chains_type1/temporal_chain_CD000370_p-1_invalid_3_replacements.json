        "title": "Safety of interferon \u03b2 treatment for chronic HCV hepatitis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In fact, chronic hepatitis C is considered as one of the primary causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the most common reason for liver transplantation. The primary objectives for the treatment of HCV-related chronic hepatitis is to eradicate infection and prevent progression of the disease. The treatment has evolved from the use of alpha-interferon (IFNalpha) alone to the combination of IFNalpha plus ribavirin, with a significant improvement in the overall efficacy, and to the newer PEG-IFNs which have further increased the virological response, used either alone or in combination with ribavirin. Despite these positive results, in terms of efficacy, concerns are related to the safety and adverse events. Many patients must reduce the dose of PEG-IFN or ribavirin, others must stop the treatment and a variable percentage of subjects are not suitable owing to intolerance toward drugs. IFNbeta represents a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and in some countries it plays an important role in therapeutic protocols. Aim of the present paper was to review available data on the safety of IFNbeta treatment in HCV-related chronic hepatitis. The rates of treatment discontinuation and/or dose modification due to the appearance of severe side effects during IFNbeta are generally low and in several clinical studies no requirements for treatment discontinuation and/or dose modifications have been reported. The most frequent side effects experienced during IFNbeta treatment are flu-like syndromes, fever, fatigue and injection-site reactions. No differences in terms of side-effect frequency and severity between responders and non-responders have been reported. A more recent study, performed to compare IFNbeta alone or in combination with ribavirin, confirmed the good safety profile of both treatments. Similar trends of adverse event frequency have been observed in subpopulations such as patients with genotype-1b HCV hepatitis unresponsive to IFNalpha treatment or with HCV-related cirrhosis and patients with acute viral hepatitis. If further studies will confirm the efficacy of combined IFNbeta and ribavirin treatment, this regimen could represent a safe and alternative therapeutic option in selected patients.",

        "title": "Host Cell Targets in HCV Therapy: Novel Strategy or Proven Practice?",
        "abstract": "The development of novel antiviral drugs against hepatitis C is a challenging and competitive area of research. Progress of this research has been hampered due to the quasispecies nature of the hepatitis C virus, the absence of cellular infection models and the lack of easily accessible and highly representative animal models. The current combination therapy consisting of interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin mainly acts by supporting host cell defence. These therapeutics are the prototypic representatives of indirect antiviral agents as they act on cellular targets. However, the therapy is not a cure, when considered from the long-term perspective, for almost half of the chronically infected patients. This draws attention to the urgent need for more efficient treatments. Novel anti-hepatitis C treatments under study are directed against a number of so-called direct antiviral targets such as polymerases and proteases, which are encoded by the virus. Although such direct antiviral approaches have proven to be successful in several viral indications, there is a risk of resistant viruses developing. In order to avoid resistance, the development of indirect antiviral compounds has to be intensified. These act on host cell targets either by boosting the immune response or by blocking the virus host cell interaction. A particularly interesting approach is the development of inhibitors that interfere with signal transduction, such as protein kinase inhibitors. The purpose of this review is to stress the importance of developing indirect antiviral agents that act on host cell targets. In doing so, a large source of potential targets and mechanisms can be exploited, thus increasing the likelihood of success. Ultimately, combination therapies consisting of drugs against direct and indirect viral targets will most probably provide the solution to fighting and eradicating hepatitis C virus in patients.",

        "abstract": "The standard of care for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pegylated interferon (IFN) alpha plus ribavirin, results in a sustained virologic response (SVR) in approximately 50%\u201060% of patients. IFN beta is a potential alternative to IFN alpha. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and durability of IFN beta and its combination with ribavirin in the na\u00efve setting of chronic hepatitis C in Asian patients. In the initial randomized, double\u2010blind phase, patients with chronic hepatitis C (n = 257) received 12 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a, 44 \u03bcg subcutaneously 3 times weekly, or a placebo. In the subsequent open\u2010label phase, placebo nonresponders received 24 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a plus ribavirin, whereas patients receiving IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy received an additional 12 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome variable was SVR, which was defined as negative HCV RNA after weeks 24 and 48. A total of 34 of 128 patients (26.6%) receiving IFN beta\u20101a achieved an SVR versus 0 of 129 patients (0%) receiving the placebo (P < 0.001). In the IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin group, 73 of 127 patients (57.5%) achieved an SVR [P < 0.001 versus IFN beta\u20101a; the adjusted odds ratio was 4.54 (95% confidence interval: 2.53, 8.13)]. In HCV genotype 1 patients, 37 of 80 patients (46.3%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin achieved an SVR versus 19 of 85 patients (22.4%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a (P = 0.001). Conclusion: IFN beta\u20101a produced a clear antiviral effect in Asian patients with chronic HCV infection. The addition of ribavirin to IFN beta\u20101a significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved an SVR versus IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy. (HEPATOLOGY 2007.)",

        "abstract": "The development of specifically targeted antiviral agents against hepatitis C is a major therapeutic advance that promises to markedly improve treatment response rates in patients with chronic infection. However, rapid emergence of drug resistance has already been described, the consequences of which are not yet understood. Although there are important differences between hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the judicious use of candidate agents against HCV should be guided by principles that have been established in the HIV therapeutic arena. In this review, we attempt to draw useful parallels between the development of antiretroviral therapy for HIV and preliminary data on antiviral agents for hepatitis C virus infection. Applying concepts learned in HIV therapeutics will hopefully lead to a prudent and cautious path in HCV treatment paradigms, particularly with respect to drug resistance.

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is often present in postmenopausal women. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the cumulative incidence and predictive factors for bone fracture after cessation of interferon (IFN) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). A total of 420 postmenopausal women treated with IFN monotherapy were enrolled. The mean observation period was 7.2 years. The primary goal was the development of bone fracture. Evaluation was carried out by using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards analysis. Thirty\u2010one out of 420 patients sustained bone fracture. The cumulative development rate of bone fracture was 3.6% at 5th year, 9.2% at 10th year, and 17.4% at 15th year. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that bone fracture after cessation of IFN therapy occurred when histological staging of the liver was advanced (hazard ratio (HR): 2.54; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.21\u20135.31; P\u2009=\u20090.013), serum albumin level was\u2009<\u20093.5g/dl (HR: 2.25; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.10\u20134.59; P\u2009=\u20090.026), and virus clearance was not achieved (HR: 3.65; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.11\u201312.05; P\u2009=\u20090.033).
