        "abstract": "Despite numerous studies on women's cardiac health throughout the past decade, the number of female deaths caused by cardiovascular disease still rises and remains the leading cause of death in women in most areas of the world. Novel studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease, and more specifically coronary artery disease presentations in women, are different than those in men. In addition, pathology and pathophysiology of the disease present significant gender differences, which leads to difficulties concerning diagnosis, treatment and outcome of the female population. The reason for this disparity is all steps for female cardiovascular disease evaluation, treatment and prevention are not well elucidated; and an area for future research. This review brings together the most recent studies published in the field of coronary artery disease in women and points out new directions for future investigation on some of the important issues.",

        "title": "Why insulin sensitizers but not secretagogues should be retained when initiating insulin in type 2 diabetes",
        "abstract": "The stringent targets set for HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes are currently achieved by fewer than half the patients in the United States. Failure to manage hyperglycaemia in the early stages of disease results in progressive loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function, which ultimately necessitates the initiation of insulin therapy. At this point, choices have to be made on whether to continue oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy and, if so, with which agent(s). Historically, sulfonylureas have been the mainstay of oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy; however, their long\u2010term efficacy in patients with depleted \u03b2\u2010cell capacity is doubtful, and other classes of oral anti\u2010diabetic drugs, notably the insulin sensitizers, may prove more reliable. These agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones) appear to provide various benefits over and above sustained glycaemic control, which may variably include reduced loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function as well as improvements to cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Metformin also limits weight gain associated with insulin therapy. This manuscript presents the case that when insulin therapy is initiated it should be tailored to individual needs through combination with one or more insulin sensitizers rather than a secretagogue.

        "abstract": "Hypoglycemia has for the most part been studied inadequately for both of the commonly used long-acting insulin analogs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Almost all existing trials have been designed to investigate changes in glycemic control and not differences in hypoglycemia events. In this review, we present an overview of the hypoglycemic data available from the randomized controlled trials comparing insulin glargine and insulin detemir with NPH or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The limited head-to-head glargine versus detemir data are also discussed with comments on early results relating to the newer insulin analog, degludec. Basal insulin analogs are associated with reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Most studies have excluded participants with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia or previous severe events, however, and hypoglycemia reporting is variable and inconsistent. This limits interpretation for those with long-duration type 1 diabetes, and particularly impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, or long-duration more insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes. New optimally designed studies are required to elucidate the true impact of basal analogs on hypoglycemia burden in those living with long-term insulin therapy.",

        "title": "Old and new basal insulin formulations: understanding pharmacodynamics is still relevant in clinical practice",
        "abstract": "Long\u2010acting insulin analogues have been developed to mimic the physiology of basal insulin secretion more closely than human insulin formulations (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn, NPH). However, the clinical evidence in favour of analogues is still controversial. Although their major benefit as compared with NPH is a reduction in the hypoglycaemia risk, some cost/effectiveness analyses have not been favourable to analogues, largely because of their higher price. Nevertheless, these new formulations have conquered the insulin market. Human insulin represents currently no more than 20% of market share. Despite (in fact because of) the widespread use of insulin analogues it remains critical to analyse the pharmacodynamics (PD) of basal insulin formulations appropriately to interpret the results of clinical trials correctly. Importantly, these data may help physicians in tailoring insulin therapy to patients' individual needs and, additionally, when clinical evidence is not available, to optimize insulin treatment. For patients at low risk for/from hypoglycaemia, it might be acceptable and also cost\u2010effective not to use long\u2010acting insulin analogues as basal insulin replacement. Conversely, in patients with a higher degree of insulin deficiency and increased risk for hypoglycaemia, analogues are the best option due to their more physiological profile, as has been shown in PD and clinical studies. From this perspective optimizing basal insulin treatment, especially in type 2 diabetes patients who are less prone to hypoglycaemia, would be suitable making significant resources available for other relevant aspects of diabetes care.",

Methodology: This prospective, randomized, multicenter, comparative, non-inferiority, open-label, parallel group, phase IV study was conducted in 14 study centers in India. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either Glaritus\u00ae or Lantus\u00ae for 12 weeks. Each week, the dose of insulin was titrated to maintain target fasting blood glucose (FBG) level range of 80 - 120 mg/dL. Results: A total of 171 subjects were randomized (Glaritus\u00ae arm-86; Lantus\u00ae arm-85) and 161 subjects completed the study. The mean change in the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from visit 3 (baseline) to visit 6 (end of trial) in Glaritus\u00ae arm was -0.69 \u00b1 1.81 and in Lantus\u00ae arm was -0.53 \u00b1 1.94. The mean change in glucose levels between week 1 and end of week 11 in Glaritus\u00ae\u00a0arm was -8.81 \u00b1 34.57 and in Lantus\u00ae arm was -5.28 \u00b1 30. At least one hypoglycemic episode was experienced by 27.2% subjects of Glaritus\u00ae arm and 28.6% subjects of Lantus\u00ae arm. A total of 24 adverse events (AEs) such as pain, pyrexia, few infection related including urinary tract infections, metabolic related such as decreased appetite, musculoskeletal, neurological and skin related were reported in the study (Lantus\u00ae arm: 14 AEs; Glaritus\u00ae arm: 10 AEs). Conclusion: In this short term, 12-week study, biosimilar insulin glargine, Glaritus\u00ae, is comparable to the reference product, Lantus\u00ae, when combined with Insulin Lispro\u00ae in terms of glycemic control, risk of hypoglycemia and occurrence of adverse drug reactions among adults with T1DM.",

A 12-week multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study was performed in 52 subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized to once-daily IDegAsp (n = 26) or basal insulin (n = 26). The primary endpoint was percent change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Furthermore, it was analyzed post hoc in subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c. During a follow-up period, percent change in HbA1c was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.161). Daily insulin doses and frequency of overall hypoglycemia were also similar in the two groups. In post hoc analyses, once-daily basal insulin was more effective than IDegAsp in subjects with HbA1c more than or equal to 8.5% (p < 0.05); however, in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant improvement in percent change in HbA1c at week 12, compared with basal insulin (p < 0.01). Although there was no apparent difference in the HbA1c-lowering effects between two groups, when compared in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant effect in comparison with once-daily basal insulin.
