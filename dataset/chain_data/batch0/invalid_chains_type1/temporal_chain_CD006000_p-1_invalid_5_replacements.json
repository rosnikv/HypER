        "abstract": "We entered 60 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine whether colchicine is therapeutically effective. Thirty patients had early disease (Stages 1 and 2), and 30 had advanced disease (Stages 3 and 4). Fifteen patients with early disease and 15 with advanced disease received colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily), and the remainder received placebo. Patients were studied about every two months; those remaining in the blind phase at two years underwent repeat liver biopsy and were then placed on open-label colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily). With a few exceptions, the results in patients with early disease were similar to those in patients with advanced disease; hence, data on patients in all stages were combined in the main analysis. During the two-year study period the colchicine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo-treated patients, had improvement in levels of serum albumin, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and aminotransferases. However, there was no such improvement in the severity of symptoms or physical findings; moreover, there was no significant difference in the histologic changes noted at liver biopsy in the two treatment groups. At four years after entry, the cumulative mortality from liver disease was 21 percent in patients given colchicine and 47 percent in those given placebo (P = 0.05). The only side effect of colchicine was diarrhea, noted in three patients. The consistent and significant improvement in a number of markers of liver disease and the apparent decreased mortality from liver disease suggest that colchicine may provide some long-term clinical benefit in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the failure of colchicine to reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis leaves uncertain the effect of the drug on the longterm outcome of this disease.",

        "abstract": "There is preliminary evidence that colchicine, an inhibitor of collagen synthesis, may be beneficial in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. To evaluate the use of colchicine (1 mg per day, five days per week) in the treatment of hepatic cirrhosis, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 patients were followed for up to 14 years. Forty-five patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 41 had posthepatitic cirrhosis, and the remaining 14 had cirrhosis with various other causes. Histologic studies were available for 92 percent of patients. Seventy-three patients were in Child-Turcotte class A, 26 were in class B, and one was in class C. Fifty-four patients received colchicine, and 46 received placebo. The overall survival in the colchicine group was markedly better than in the placebo group (median survival, 11 and 3.5 years, respectively; P less than 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 75 percent in the colchicine group and 34 percent in the placebo group; the corresponding 10-year survival rates were 56 percent and 20 percent. Among the 30 patients treated with colchicine who underwent repeated liver biopsies, histologic improvement was seen in 9; the liver appeared normal in 2, and 7 had minimal portal fibrosis. No histologic improvement was observed in the 14 members of the placebo group who had two or more biopsies. Few side effects were observed in either group.",

        "abstract": "Recurrence is one of the major complications of pericarditis. Treatment of recurrence is often difficult, and immunosuppressive drugs or surgery may be necessary. We conducted an open-label prospective study of nine patients (seven men and two women; age, 18-64 years; mean age, 41.7 +/- 13.7 years). Patients were treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) to prevent recurrences. All patients had suffered at least three relapses despite treatment with acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, prednisone, or a combination. Pericarditis was classified as idiopathic in five patients, postpericardiotomy in two, post-myocardial infarction in one, and associated with disseminated lupus erythematosus in one. For statistical analysis, we conducted a paired comparison design (Student's t test). All patients treated with colchicine responded favorably to therapy. Prednisone was discontinued in all patients after 2-6 weeks (mean, 26.33 +/- 10.9 days), and colchicine alone was continued. After a mean follow-up of 24.3 months (minimum, 10 months; maximum, 54 months), no recurrences were observed in any patient; there was a significant difference between the symptom-free periods before and after treatment with colchicine (p less than 0.002). Our study suggests that colchicine may be useful in avoiding recurrence of pericarditis, although these results need to be confirmed in a larger, double-blind study.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe most troublesome complication of acute pericarditis is recurrent episodes of pericardial inflammation, occurring in 15% to 32% of cases. The cause of the recurrence is usually unknown, although in some cases it may be traced to viral infection or may be a consequence of coronary artery bypass grafting. The optimal method for prevention has not been fully established; accepted modalities include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and pericardiectomy.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nBased on the proven efficacy of colchicine therapy for familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent polyserositis), several small studies have used colchicine successfully to prevent recurrence of acute pericarditis after failure of conventional treatment. Recently, we reported the results from the largest multicenter international study on 51 patients who were treated with colchicine to prevent further relapses and who were followed up for < or = 10 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn light of new trial data that have accumulated in the past decade, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of colchicine for the prevention of recurrent episodes of pericarditis. Clinical and personal experience shows that colchicine may be an extremely promising adjunct to conventional treatment and may ultimately serve as the initial mode of treatment, especially in idiopathic cases.",

        "abstract": "To the Editor: \n\nWe read with great interest the article by Adler et al regarding colchicine treatment for recurrent pericarditis.1 The authors described 51 patients from Israel, Spain, and the United States. The pericarditis was idiopathic in 33 patients and secondary in 18. Recurrences of pericarditis did not respond to conventional therapy consisting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis, or some combination thereof and could only be controlled after the initiation of colchicine treatment. The authors concluded that colchicine was effective and safe for the long-term prevention of recurrent pericarditis, especially in idiopathic cases.\n\nColchicine therapy has been shown to be an effective method for eliminating attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent and self-limited attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of peritoneum, synovium, and pleura.2 Pericardial involvement is a rare but well-known feature of the disease.2 Tauber et al3 reported 2 patients who had recurrent pericarditis \u2026",

We looked for: 1) the occurrence of new diagnoses of autoimmune diseases during our follow up; 2) HLA typing; and 3) the presence of the most frequent mutations linked to familial Mediterranean fever (FMF gene or MEFV). HLA typing was done in 21 patients at loci B, DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1. MEFV gene was looked in 23 patients using specific primers. During the follow-up we made a new diagnosis of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome in four patients (8.7%) and of rheumatoid arthritis in one patient (2.2%). HLA B14, DRB1*01 and DQB1*0202 were significantly more prevalent, but we did not find a typical HLA typing. MEFV gene was searched: exon 10 was checked by sequence and the E148Q mutation by restriction site analysis. No mutations were found. In conclusion, the prevalence of definite immunorheumatological diseases and the absence of the mutations linked to FMF reinforce the notion that idiopathic acute recurrent pericarditis is an autoimmune condition.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy of a multidrug protocol in recurrent acute pericarditis. We tried also to assess the specific role of colchicine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 58 patients (34 males) in the largest monocentric observational study. All patients received prolonged courses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; generally we do not start a corticosteroid in recurrent acute pericarditis, but if a steroid had already been started, we planned a very slow tapering; if necessary azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, and other immunosuppressive drugs were used; 44 patients (27 males, 61.4%) were treated also with colchicine and 14 patients (7 males, 50%) were not given this drug.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter starting our protocol recurrences dropped from 0.48 to 0.03 attacks/patient/month (p < 0.00001) within 12 months and remained at the same level till the end of the follow-up (mean 8.1 years) in the whole cohort. In the 44 patients treated with colchicine recurrences dropped from 0.54 to 0.03 attacks/patient/month (p < 0.00001) within 12 months, and in 14 patients not given colchicine recurrences decreased from 0.31 to 0.06 attacks/patient/month (p = 0.002). In patients treated with colchicine the decrease was significantly higher (0.51) than in patients not taking this drug (0.25) (p = 0.006). Colchicine was discontinued by 16.3% of patients because of side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA multidrug protocol including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at high dosage, slow tapering of corticosteroid, colchicine, reassurance and close clinical monitoring is very effective in recurrent pericarditis; this improvement is more dramatic in colchicine treated patients, but also patients who do not tolerate it can achieve good control of the disease.",

The exact recurrence rate is unknown, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, and only routine laboratory testing is required. In many, probably most cases, this is an autoimmune disease, but sometimes it is caused by reactivation of viral pericarditis, an unrelated infection, or is provoked by corticosteroid therapy. Therapeutic modalities are non-specific and varied, and usually the etiology is autoimmunity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with the possible addition of colchicine are the best first-choice treatment, before steroid therapy is tried. Corticosteroid therapy is an independent risk factor for recurrences. In order to provide an evidence-based clinical approach to management, we performed a systematic review of all publications on acute and recurrent pericarditis focusing on recent clinical trials.",

Nevertheless, clinicians are often sceptical about the efficacy of the drug, and concerns have risen on possible side effects and tolerability. In this review, we analyse current evidence to support the use of the drug, as well as possible harms and risks related to drug interactions, reaching the conclusion that colchicine is safe and useful in recurrent pericarditis, if specific precautions are followed, although less evidence supports its use for the treatment of acute pericarditis, where colchicine remains optional and there is a need for further multicentre confirmatory studies.

        "abstract": "Recurrent pericarditis is a problematic clinical condition that impairs the quality of life of the affected patients due to the need for repeated hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and complications from medications, especially glucocorticoids. Unfortunately, available treatments for recurrent pericarditis are very limited, including only a handful of medications such as aspirin/NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, colchicine, and immunosuppressants (such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockers, azathioprine, and intravenous human immunoglobulins). Until recently, the clinical experience with the latter class of medications was very limited. Nevertheless, in the last decade, experience with IL-1 blockers has consistently grown, and valid clinical data have emerged from randomized clinical trials. Accordingly, IL-1 blockers are a typical paradigm shift in the treatment of refractory recurrent pericarditis with a clearly positive cost/benefit ratio for those unfortunate patients with multiple recurrences. A drawback related to the above-mentioned medications is the absence of universally accepted and established treatment protocols regarding the full dose administration period and the need for a tapering protocol for individual medications. Another concern is the need for long-standing treatments, which should be discussed with the patients. The above-mentioned unmet needs are expected to be addressed in the near future, such as further insights into pathophysiology and an individualized approach to affected patients.",

Potentially relevant studies published were searched in BioMedCentral, the Cochrane Collaboration Database of Randomised Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Scopus. The PPS is a complication of cardiac and thoracic surgery that affects 10% to 40% of patients. The etiopathogenesis is incompletely understood and it is supposed to be immune mediated following pleuropericardial trauma and bleeding. There are no standardized criteria for the diagnosis although a combination of clinical criteria have been proposed in clinical trials for PPS prevention and include fever without alternative causes, pericardial or pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rubs, and pericardial and/or pleural effusion. Treatment is empiric and based on aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or corticosteroids plus colchicine. Prevention of the PPS has been demonstrated possible and safe with the use of colchicine for 1 month. Although PPS may be responsible for a prolongation of hospital stay and readmissions, the overall prognosis is generally good with low risk of recurrences and cardiac tamponade. The risk of developing constrictive pericarditis has been reported in 2% to 3% of cases in a long-term follow-up. PPS is a common postoperative complication, generally occurring in the first 3 months after surgery. Severe complications are not common, but the syndrome is responsible for hospital stay prolongation and readmissions.",

The currently available anti-inflammatory drug therapy is often not successful or causes intolerable side effects. Thus, new anti-inflammatory substances are still urgently needed. Plants were the first source of remedies in the history of mankind. Since their chemical characterization in the 19th century, herbal bioactive compounds have fueled drug development. Also, nowadays, new plant-derived agents continuously enrich our drug arsenal (e.g., vincristine, galantamine, and artemisinin). The number of new, pharmacologically active herbal ingredients, in particular that of anti-inflammatory compounds, rises continuously. The major obstacle in this field is the translation of preclinical knowledge into evidence-based clinical progress. Human trials of good quality are often missing or, when available, are frequently not suitable to really prove a therapeutical value. This minireview will summarize the current situation of 6 very prominent plant-derived anti-inflammatory compounds: curcumin, colchicine, resveratrol, capsaicin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and quercetin. We will highlight their clinical potential and/or pinpoint an overestimation. Moreover, we will sum up the planned trials in order to provide insights into the inflammatory disorders that are hypothesized to be beneficially influenced by the compound.",

The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 240 patients were enrolled, and 120 were randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. The primary outcome occurred in 20 patients (16.7%) in the colchicine group and 45 patients (37.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction in the colchicine group, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72; number needed to treat, 4; P<0.001). Colchicine reduced the rate of symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40.0%, P=0.001), the number of recurrences per patient (0.21 vs. 0.52, P=0.001), and the hospitalization rate (5.0% vs. 14.2%, P=0.02).

        "abstract": "We thank Drs Chhabra and Spodick for their interest in our publication.1 Indeed they raise interesting questions for which we provide some answers in the following paragraphs.\n\nWe do think there may be important differences in the mechanism of post ablation pericarditis and of idiopathic pericarditis and thereby for recurrences also. For example, recurrences are highly common in idiopathic pericarditis (10%\u201330%),2 but occurred in only 1 of 85 patients (1%) in the present study.\n\nTwo additional diagnostic criteria for pericarditis are mentioned by Drs Chhabra and Spodick, namely, pericardial effusion on echocardiography and pericardial \u2026",

        "title": "Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery: clinical update on mechanisms and prophylactic strategies.",
        "abstract": "ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF) is a common complication after cardiac surgery and is associated with increased cost, morbidity, and mortality. Minimally invasive surgical techniques such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have not substantially reduced the risk of developing AF. The development of AF after cardiac surgery remains common and significantly increases mortality, morbidity, and total hospital costs, including readmission. In an effort to reduce these adverse consequences of this complication, considerable research recently has focused on identifying prophylactic strategies for AF after cardiac surgery. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying the genesis of AF in this setting may aid in designing preventative paradigms and standardizing treatment. The purpose of this expert review is to highlight the incidence, pathogenesis, and preventative strategies for AF after cardiac surgery.",

        "abstract": "We read with great interest the study by Solomon et al 1 regarding the effect of colchicine on risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and all-cause mortality. In their study, they report a marked reduction in the number of CV events and all-cause mortality with the use of colchicine when compared with a reference group not using this drug. Sensitivity analyses mimicking an intention to treat approach showed similar results. Interestingly, no clear gradient of effect according to duration of use was found. The striking \u2026",
