        "abstract": "Summary: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that is characterized by joint stiffness in the morning, symmetric joint swelling, and generalized fatigue. Given the limitations of medical treatment and the ongoing problems with symptom management, it is not at all surprising that many individuals with RA turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. This article provides a brief overview of what is known about CAM use in RA, presents information on a few of the most popular therapies, and recommends further resources for nurses who work with individuals with RA.",

        "title": "Blindness and Bias in a Trial of Antidepressant Medication For Chronic Tension-Type Headache",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to examine penetration of the blind in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Neurologists' ratings of improvement and medication side-effects, participants' ratings of improvement and daily diary recordings of headaches were assessed along with participants' and neurologists' guesses about treatment group placement in participants who completed at least 3 months of treatment (N = 169). Despite blinding, treating neurologists successfully identified the medication condition for 82\u00b1 of participants receiving medication only; trial participants accurately identified their medication condition when receiving active medication (77\u00b1 of participants), but not when receiving placebo. Concurrent stress-management therapy reduced, but did not eliminate penetration of the blind. Irrespective of drug condition, when participants were improved they were judged to be on active medication and when unimproved they were judged to be on placebo. However, neurologists' ratings of improvement, participants' reports of improvement and daily headache recordings yielded equivalent outcomes. Penetration of the blind needs to be assessed, not assumed in clinical trials in headache. However, penetration of the blind did not produce a prodrug bias as has been asserted by critics. Better methods of assessing and quantifying blindness are needed.",

        "abstract": "Modern medicine has progressed in parallel with the advancement of biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology. By using the tools of modern medicine, the physician today can treat and prevent a number of diseases through pharmacology, genetics, and physical interventions. Besides this materia medica, the patient's mind, cognitions, and emotions play a central part as well in any therapeutic outcome, as investigated by disciplines such as psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology. This review describes recent findings that give scientific evidence to the old tenet that patients must be both cured and cared for. In fact, we are today in a good position to investigate complex psychological factors, like placebo effects and the doctor-patient relationship, by using a physiological and neuroscientific approach. These intricate psychological factors can be approached through biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology, thus eliminating the old dichotomy between biology and psychology. This is both a biomedical and a philosophical enterprise that is changing the way we approach and interpret medicine and human biology. In the first case, curing the disease only is not sufficient, and care of the patient is of tantamount importance. In the second case, the philosophical debate about the mind-body interaction can find some important answers in the study of placebo effects. Therefore, maybe paradoxically, the placebo effect and the doctor-patient relationship can be approached by using the same biochemical, cellular and physiological tools of the materia medica, which represents an epochal transition from general concepts such as suggestibility and power of mind to a true physiology of the doctor-patient interaction.",

This qualitative study uses grounded theory methodology to analyze data from 25 interviews with adult patients and/or adult family members who received spiritual care in a large tertiary care hospital. Analysis reveals three key themes in chaplaincy care: the attributes valued in the chaplain\u2019s presence, the elements necessary to form relationship with the chaplain, and the role of the chaplain in helping patients to discover and express meaning in their experiences. The authors weave these three themes together into a grounded theory and propose an assessment model that incorporates psychological theory about human motivation, faith development, and the development of autonomy. An understanding of the proposed assessment model can guide chaplain interventions and benefit all members of the clinical care team.",

We then consider the implications of this approach for understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allostasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a \u2018locked in\u2019 brain that is relatively insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ways our approach might reveal new insights for the treatment of depression.

        "title": "The neurobiology of interoception in health and disease",
        "abstract": "Interoception is the sensing of internal bodily sensations. Interoception is an umbrella term that encompasses (1) the afferent (body\u2010to\u2010brain) signaling through distinct neural and humoral (including immune and endocrine) channels; (2) the neural encoding, representation, and integration of this information concerning internal bodily state; (3) the influence of such information on other perceptions, cognitions, and behaviors; (4) and the psychological expression of these representations as consciously accessible physical sensations and feelings. Interoceptive mechanisms ensure physiological health through the cerebral coordination of homeostatic reflexes and allostatic responses that include motivational behaviors and associated affective and emotional feelings. Furthermore, the conscious, unitary sense of self in time and space may be grounded in the primacy and lifelong continuity of interoception. Body\u2010to\u2010brain interactions influence physical and mental well\u2010being. Consequently, we show that systematic investigation of how individual differences, and within\u2010individual changes, in interoceptive processing can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of physical and psychological disorders. We present a neurobiological overview of interoception and describe how interoceptive impairments at different levels relate to specific physical and mental health conditions, including sickness behaviors and fatigue, depression, eating disorders, autism, and anxiety. We frame these findings in an interoceptive predictive processing framework and highlight potential new avenues for treatments.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims: Many studies have conclusively proven that meditative techniques derived from the Indian systems of philosophy, meditation and ritual classified as \u201cTantra\u201d can bring about sustained changes in the structure and function of the nervous system of practitioners. The aim of this study is to provide neuroscientists a framework through which to interpret Tantra, and thereby provide a foundation upon which future interdisciplinary study can be built. Methods: We juxtapose Tantric concepts such as the subtle body, nadis and mantras with relevant neuroscientific findings. Our premise is that through sustained internalization of attention, Tantric practitioners were able to identify and document subtle changes in their field of awareness, which usually do not cross the threshold to come into our perception. Results: The descriptions left by Tantric philosophers are often detailed and empirical, but they are about subjective phenomena, rather than external objects. They also focus on individual experiences, rather than the group-level analyses favored by modern medical science. Conclusion: Systematic exploration of Tantric texts can be of tremendous value in expanding our understanding of human beings' experiential reality, by enabling us to build bridges between first-person and third-person approaches to the nervous system. This may open up new avenues for cognitive enhancement and treating neurological diseases.",

        "title": "Validation of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) questionnaire in hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder",
        "abstract": "Objectives Interoception refers to the sensation, interpretation, and integration of internal somatic signals. Abnormalities in self-reported interoception are prevalent features of major depressive disorder (MDD) and may affect treatment outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the psychometric properties of the revised eight-dimensional and 37-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (the MAIA-2) in a severely depressed sample, after translating two updated scales (Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying) into German. Specifically, we examined the measure\u2019s internal consistency reliability, sensitivity to change, and minimal important differences (MID) with a focus on patient\u2019s antidepressive responses to treatment. Methods The study enrolled 110 participants (age: M = 46.85, SD = 11.23; female: 55.45%) undergoing hospital treatment, of whom 87 were included in the pre-post analysis. Participants completed a German translation of MAIA-2 and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (pre-/post-treatment). Internal consistency reliability was determined by Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1/McDonalds\u2019s \u03c9, sensitivity to change was determined by effect sizes, and MIDs were determined by distribution- (0.5*SD) and anchor-based approaches (mean change method; ROC curve cut-points). Results Depression severity reduced over the course of treatment (Median = -65.22%), and 34.48% of patients achieved remission. Reliability was appropriate for post-treatment (range of \u03c9: .70-.90), but questionable for two pre-treatment scales (Noticing: \u03c9 = .64; Not-Distracting: \u03c9 = .66). The eight dimensions of MAIA-2 were sensitive to change (standardized response mean: .32-.81; Cohen\u2019s effect size: .30-.92). Distribution-based MIDs (.38-.61) and anchor-based mean change MIDs (remission vs. partial response: .00-.85; partial response vs. nonresponse: .08-.88) were established on the group level. For six scales, ROC cut-points (remission: .00\u20131.33; response: -.20\u20131.00) demonstrated accurate classification to treatment response groups on the individual level. Conclusions This study demonstrated the applicability of the MAIA-2 questionnaire in MDD. The updated version may have led to reliability improvements regarding the revised scales, but subthreshold reliability was evident prior to treatment. The measure\u2019s dimensions were sensitive to change. MIDs were established that corresponded with antidepressive treatment outcomes. Our findings are consistent with a growing area of research which considers somatic feelings as key contributors to mental health.",

        "abstract": "Distress is a growing public health concern. In this three-armed randomized controlled trial, n = 102 adults with elevated stress levels and stress-related symptoms were randomly assigned to (1) \u201cintegrative\u201d yoga classes which combined physical exercises, mindfulness training, and ethical/philosophical aspects of traditional yoga; to (2) Iyengar yoga classes which entailed primarily physical exercises; or to (3) mindfulness training without physical training. We hypothesized the synergistic effects of physical yoga exercises, mindfulness, and ethical/philosophical aspects. The primary outcome was the group difference on Cohen\u2019s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included burnout, quality of life, physical complaints, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, interoceptive awareness, self-regulation, spirituality, mysticism, and posttraumatic stress. All outcomes were evaluated at baseline (V0), after 12 weeks (V1), and after 24 weeks (V2). A subset of participants took part in qualitative interviews. A lasting and clinically relevant stress reduction was observed within all groups (PSS \u0394V0\u2013V1Integrative Yoga = \u22126.69 \u00b1 6.19; \u0394V0\u2013V1Iyengar Yoga = \u22126.00 \u00b1 7.37; \u0394V0\u2013V1Mindfulness = \u22129.74 \u00b1 7.80; all p < 0.00). Effect sizes were also statistically large at the end of the follow-up period (Cohen\u2019s d Integrative Yoga = 1.41; d Iyengar Yoga = 1.37; d Mindfulness = 1.23). There were no significant group differences or evidence of relevant synergistic effects from combining mindfulness and physical yoga exercises. All three interventions were found to be equally effective methods of stress reduction. Their use in practice should be based on availability and patient preference.",

The aim of the study was to assess whether the amplitude of the heartbeat evoked cortical potential (HEP), a correlate of interoceptive accuracy, differs in participants with low (lows) and high (highs) hypnotizability scores (assessed by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form A) before and after the induction of hypnosis. ECG and EEG were monitored in 16 highs and 15 lows during an experimental session, including open eyes baseline (B), closed eyes relaxation (R), hypnotic induction (IND), neutral hypnosis (NH), and post session baseline (Post). No significant difference was observed between groups and conditions in autonomic variables. The HEP amplitude was lower in highs than in lows at the right parietal site, likely due to hypnotizability related differences in the functional connection between the right insula and parietal cortex. It increased in highs and decreased in lows across the session, possibly due to the highs' preeminently internally directed attention and to the lows' possible disengagement from the task. Since interoception is involved in several cognitive-emotional functions, its hypnotizability related differences may contribute to the variability of experience and behavior in daily life.",

        "abstract": "The hypnotizability-related differences in morpho-functional characteristics of the insula could at least partially account for the differences in interoceptive accuracy (IA) observed between high and low hypnotizable individuals (highs, lows). Our aim was to investigate interoceptive processing in highs, lows, and medium hypnotizable individuals (mediums), who represent most of the population, during a 10-minute open eyes relaxation condition (Part 1) and three repetitions of consecutive 2-minute open eyes, closed eyes, and heartbeat counting conditions, followed by a 2-minute post-counting condition (Part 2). Electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram were recorded in 14 highs, 14 mediums, and 18 lows, classified according to the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form A. Heartbeat-evoked cortical potentials (HEP) were extracted throughout the entire session, and IA index was obtained for the heartbeat counting task (HCT). In Part 1, significant hypnotizability-related differences were observed in the right central region in both early and late HEP components, with lows showing positive amplitudes and highs/mediums showing negative amplitudes. In Part 2, the same group differences were limited to the early component. Moreover, in the left frontal regions, only mediums modified their HEP during the counting task with respect to the open/closed eyes conditions, whereas highs displayed HEP differences between counting and post-counting rest. HCT did not show significant group differences. In conclusion, highs and mediums seem to be more similar than mediums and lows regarding HEP, despite the absence of significant differences in HCT. Nonetheless, a negative correlation between hypnotizability scores and HEP amplitudes was observed in the regions showing group differences.",
