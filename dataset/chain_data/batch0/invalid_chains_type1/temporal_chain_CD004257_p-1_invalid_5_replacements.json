        "title": "Analgesic Efficacy and Safety Of Nonprescription Doses of Naproxen Sodium Compared With Acetaminophen in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee",
        "abstract": "Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, and placebo were compared to determine their efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis of the knee. In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose, parallel-design studies, patients with osteoarthritis aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 60.6 \u00b1 12.8 years were randomized to daily doses of 660 mg naproxen sodium (440 mg naproxen sodium in patients \u226565 years), 4000 mg acetaminophen, or placebo for 7 days. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in pain at rest, on passive motion, on weight-bearing, stiffness after rest (morning), day and night pain compared with placebo, and significantly greater relief from resting pain than acetaminophen (P < 0.05). Acetaminophen provided significantly greater improvements in day pain compared with placebo. Daily evaluations showed naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided superior pain relief to acetaminophen and was significantly better than acetaminophen at reducing difficulties experienced in walking several blocks and difficulties in bending, lifting, and stooping. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) and acetaminophen (4000 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mobility level, household tasks, and walking and bending. Patient and investigator evaluation scores were significantly higher in naproxen sodium and acetaminophen groups compared with placebo; no differences were observed between active treatments. Naproxen sodium and acetaminophen had similar safety profiles to placebo. Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) effectively relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis. Naproxen sodium is an alternative in the initial treatment of osteoarthritis and may be preferred to acetaminophen as first-line therapy in patients with moderate or severe pain.",

In patients with end-stage liver disease, adverse events from analgesics are frequent, potentially fatal, and often avoidable. Severe complications from analgesia in these patients include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in substantial morbidity and even death. In general, acetaminophen at reduced dosing is a safe option. In patients with cirrhosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided to avert renal failure, and opiates should be avoided or used sparingly, with low and infrequent dosing, to prevent encephalopathy.

        "abstract": "While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.",

Results: In mice, ASS increased before injury, peaked before alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased rapidly. Fischer rats had a greater increase in ASS relative to ALT. Patients with abnormal liver test results had very high ASS compared to controls. ASS appeared to increase early in some patients, and declined rapidly in all.

        "title": "Acetaminophen: Dose-Dependent Drug Hepatotoxicity and Acute Liver Failure in Patients",
        "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced liver injury is a rare but serious clinical problem. A number of drugs can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure at therapeutic doses in a very limited number of patients (<1:10,000). This idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, which is currently not predictable in preclinical safety studies, appears to depend on individual susceptibility and the inability to adapt to the cellular stress caused by a particular drug. In striking contrast to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, drugs with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity are mostly detected during preclinical studies and do not reach the market. One notable exception is acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol), which is a safe drug at therapeutic doses but can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure after intentional and unintentional overdoses. Key Messages: APAP overdose is responsible for more acute liver failure cases in the USA or UK than all other etiologies combined. Since APAP overdose in the mouse represents a model for the human pathophysiology, substantial progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of cell death, liver injury and recovery. More recently, emerging evidence based on mechanistic biomarker analysis in patients and studies of cell death in human hepatocytes suggests that most of the mechanisms discovered in mice also apply to patients. The rapid development of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote against APAP overdose was based on the early understanding of APAP toxicity in mice. However, despite the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in patients who present early after APAP overdose, there is a need to develop intervention strategies for late-presenting patients. Conclusions: The challenges related to APAP toxicity are to better understand the mechanisms of cell death in order to limit liver injury and prevent acute liver failure, and also to develop biomarkers that better predict as early as possible who is at risk for developing acute liver failure with poor outcome.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs were discovered more than 2 decades ago and have profound impact on diverse biological processes. Specific microRNAs have important roles in modulating the innate immune response and their dysregulation has been demonstrated to contribute to inflammatory diseases. MiR\u2010223 in particular, is very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It functions as key modulator for the differentiation and activation of myeloid cells. The central role of miR\u2010223 in myeloid cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage differentiation and activation has been studied extensively. MiR\u2010223 contributes to myeloid differentiation by enhancing granulopoiesis while inhibiting macrophage differentiation. Uncontrolled myeloid activation has detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. MiR\u2010223 serves as a negative feedback mechanism controlling excessive innate immune responses in the maintenance of myeloid cell homeostasis. This review summarizes several topics covering the function of miR\u2010223 in myeloid differentiation, neutrophil and macrophage functions, as well as in inflammatory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, nonmyeloid functions of miR\u2010223 are also discussed in this review. Therapeutic enhancement of miR\u2010223 to dampen inflammatory targets is also highlighted as potential treatment to control excessive innate immune responses during mucosal inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to more severe forms of liver injury including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In humans, only 20%\u201040% of patients with fatty liver progress to NASH, and mice fed a high\u2010fat diet (HFD) develop fatty liver but are resistant to NASH development. To understand how simple steatosis progresses to NASH, we examined hepatic expression of anti\u2010inflammatory microRNA\u2010223 (miR\u2010223) and found that this miRNA was highly elevated in hepatocytes in HFD\u2010fed mice and in human NASH samples. Genetic deletion of miR\u2010223 induced a full spectrum of NAFLD in long\u2010term HFD\u2010fed mice including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that, compared to wild\u2010type mice, HFD\u2010fed miR\u2010223 knockout (miR\u2010223KO) mice had greater hepatic expression of many inflammatory genes and cancer\u2010related genes, including (C\u2010X\u2010C motif) chemokine 10 (Cxcl10) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ\u2010binding motif (Taz), two well\u2010known factors that promote NASH development. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Cxcl10 and Taz are two downstream targets of miR\u2010223 and that overexpression of miR\u2010223 reduced their expression in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatic levels of miR\u2010223, CXCL10, and TAZ mRNA were elevated in human NASH samples, which positively correlated with hepatic levels of several miR\u2010223 targeted genes as well as several proinflammatory, cancer\u2010related, and fibrogenic genes. Conclusion: HFD\u2010fed miR\u2010223KO mice develop a full spectrum of NAFLD, representing a clinically relevant mouse NAFLD model; miR\u2010223 plays a key role in controlling steatosis\u2010to\u2010NASH progression by inhibiting hepatic Cxcl10 and Taz expression and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.",

We implemented a mouse model recapitulating more closely the human pathology as it is characterized by both an autoimmune heterogeneity and the presence of cortical lesions, two parameters missing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In our model, mice clustered in two groups displaying high or low clinical scores. Upon cortical cytokine injection, lesions appeared with a specific topography while cortical miRNA profiles were altered. These two features differed according to disease severity. We evidenced changes in miRNA regulators and targets suggesting that miRNA alteration had functional repercussions that could explain the differences in cortical lesions.

        "abstract": "Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and its prevalence and mortality rate are increasing due to the lack of biomarkers and effective treatments. The Hippo signaling pathway has long been known to control liver size, and genetic depletion of Hippo kinases leads to liver cancer in mice through activation of the downstream effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Both YAP and TAZ not only reprogram tumor cells but also alter the tumor microenvironment to exert carcinogenic effects. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of YAP/TAZ-mediated liver tumorigenesis will help overcome liver cancer. For decades, small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), have been reported to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of many cancers, including liver cancer. However, the interactions between miRNAs and Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling in the liver are still largely unknown. Here, we review miRNAs that influence the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of tumor cells by modulating Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling during hepatic tumorigenesis. Previous findings suggest that these miRNAs are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of liver cancer.",

        "abstract": "Cistanche deserticola Y.C. Ma (CD) possesses hepatoprotective activity, while the active ingredients and involved mechanisms have not been fully explored. The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and hepatoprotective mechanisms of CD. We primarily used ultra-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) to identify the phenylethanoid glycoside (PhG) components of CD. Then, network analysis was used to correlate and predict the pharmacology of the identified active components of PhGs with hepatoprotection. Next, the mechanisms of the core components and targets of action were explored by cellular assays and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) target competition assays. Finally, its hepatoprotective effects were further validated in in vivo experiments. The results showed that a total of 34 PhGs were identified based on the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method. Echinacoside (ECH) was identified as the key ingredient, and TLR4 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) were speculated as the core targets of the hepatoprotective effect of CD via network analysis. The cellular assays confirmed that PhGs had significant anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot indicated that ECH notably reduced the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), as well as the mRNA expression of TLR4, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, and decreased the high expression of the TLR4 protein, which in turn downregulated the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), p-P65 and TNF-\u03b1 proteins in the inflammatory model. The target competition experiments suggested that ECH and LPS could competitively bind to the TLR4 receptor, thereby reducing the expression of TLR4 downstream proteins. The results of in vivo studies showed that ECH significantly ameliorated LPS-induced hepatic inflammatory infiltration and liver tissue damage and reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in mice. Moreover, ECH remarkably inhibited the release of inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and MCP-1 in the serum of mice, exerting the hepatoprotective effect by the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. More importantly, ECH could act as a potential inhibitor of TLR4 and deserves further in-depth study. Our results could provide a basis for exploring the hepatoprotective properties of CD.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neutrophils are key mediators of inflammation during acute liver injury (ALI). Emerging evidence suggests that they also contribute to injury resolution and tissue repair. However, the different neutrophil subsets involved in these processes and their kinetics are undefined. Herein, we characterized neutrophil kinetics and heterogeneity during ALI. Methods: We used the carbon tetrachloride model of ALI and employed flow cytometry, tissue imaging, and quantitative RT-PCR to characterize intrahepatic neutrophils during the necroinflammatory early and late repair phases of the wound healing response to ALI. We FACS sorted intrahepatic neutrophils at key time points and examined their transcriptional profiles using RNA-sequencing. Finally, we evaluated neutrophil protein translation, mitochondrial function and metabolism, reactive oxygen species content, and neutrophil extracellular traps generation. Results: We detected 2 temporarily distinct waves of neutrophils during (1) necroinflammation (at 24 hours after injury) and (2) late repair (at 72 hours). Early neutrophils were proinflammatory, characterized by: (1) upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, (2) activation of the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway, (3) reduction of protein translation, (4) decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and (5) higher propensity to generate reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps. In contrast, late neutrophils were prorepair and enriched in genes and pathways associated with tissue repair and angiogenesis. Finally, early proinflammatory neutrophils were characterized by the expression of a short isoform of C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, while the late prorepair neutrophils were characterized by the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4. Conclusions: This study underscores the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and their dual role in inflammation and tissue repair during ALI.",
