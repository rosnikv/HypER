        "title": "Management of fatty liver disease with vitamin E and C compared to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS\nDespite a proposed role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, antioxidant approaches have not been investigated sufficiently in the therapy of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our aim was to determine whether vitamin E plus C therapy is effective in normalization of liver enzymes compared to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in patients with fatty liver disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was an open-labeled, prospective, randomized study enrolling patients with histologically proven fatty liver disease who had chronically elevated alanine aminotransferase, despite a three-month reducing diet. Patients consuming alcohol (more than 20 g/day) were excluded. The patients were randomly prescribed either oral vitamin E (600 IU/day) plus vitamin C (500 mg/day) or ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg/day). Patients were randomized as two groups to receive vitamin E plus vitamin C combination (28 patients, 10 F) or ursodeoxycholic acid treatment (29 patients, 13 F).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant change in body mass index before and after the treatment in both groups. At the end of six months of therapy, serum aspartate aminotransferase and aminotransferase levels significantly decreased in both treatment options. Vitamin E and C combination was more efficacious on serum aminotransferase levels than ursodeoxycholic acid, but the difference was not significant. Alanine aminotransferase decreased to normal levels in 17 of 27 (63%) and in 16 of 29 patients (55%), respectively, in the two groups. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid, but no change was obtained in the vitamin-treated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVitamin E plus C combination treatment is a safe, inexpensive and effective treatment option in patients with fatty liver disease, with results comparable to those obtained with ursodeoxycholic acid. Since more effective new therapeutic options are lacking, patients with fatty liver disease should be encouraged to take vitamin E and C supplements, which are safe and affordable.",

        "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is found in individuals who do not drink or abuse alcohol and represents a significant health burden for the general community. NAFLD is often associated with one or more features of the metabolic syndrome and has potential for evolution towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the necro-inflammatory form of liver steatosis. The most worrisome evolutive events in a subgroup of NASH patients include advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH is complex, but studies point to a pre-eminent role of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the liver, including early mitochondrial dysfunction. Changes follow an insulin resistance status with a background of a chronic pro-inflammatory status due to an excess of visceral adiposity. Although no established therapy exists for NAFLD/NASH, potential therapeutic approaches are discussed in this review.",

        "abstract": "To the Editor: The authors point out that in patients with moderate and severe BPH-related LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms), the combination therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin continues to ensure satisfactory QoL (quality of life) scores up to 4 years of follow up (1). We came a long way in the last 2 decades. Most of our patients presenting with BPHrelated LUTS do commence conservative therapy with alpha blockers and \u2044 or 5 alpha reductase inhibitor and level 1 evidence proves to us that up to 50 per cent of the patient will defer surgery in the next 4 years because of improved objective and subjective self assessed BPH-related BOO (bladder outflow obstruction) parameters. The authors also underline twice in their article that in clinical practice guidelines in general and BPH in particular, patientreported health outcomes are as important as objective parameters of treatment outcome. However, it is becoming increasingly obvious that as our patients have a longer life expectancy, they age during conservative therapy for BPH and follow up in real life most of the time extends well over 4 years. Moreover, self reporting of QoL becomes increasingly difficult and inaccurate with progressing age. We must also not forget that in some patients regardless of their age, QoL scores do not correlate well with objective BOO parameters such as postvoiding residues and uroflow parameters (2). Consequently, postvoiding residues, secondary hydronephrosis and renal deterioration may progress silently without any obvious decrease in the QoL scores. Although there is no doubt that a large majority of patient will fare well objectively and subjectively, we must keep an open mind and an acceptable level of alertness, avoiding complacency and perform also periodic objective measurements of treatment outcome, such as ultrasound of the urinary tract and serum renal function tests in order to avoid silent irreparable deterioration of the lower and upper urinary tracts.

        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewRecent data suggest that mineralocorticoid receptor activation can affect insulin resistance independent of its effects on blood pressure. This review discusses new evidence linking mineralocorticoid receptor to insulin resistance and the underlying mechanisms of these effects. Recent findingsObservational studies have shown mineralocorticoid activity to be associated with insulin resistance irrespective of race, blood pressure or body weight. Increased mineralocorticoid activity may be the common link between obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, features that make up the metabolic syndrome. Treatment of primary aldosteronism is associated with a decrease in insulin resistance and provides one of the most convincing evidences in favor of the contribution of mineralocorticoid receptor to insulin resistance. Dietary salt restriction, which increases aldosterone levels, is also associated with an increase in insulin resistance. Potential mechanisms by which mineralocorticoid receptor may contribute to insulin resistance include a decreased transcription of the insulin receptor gene, increased degradation of insulin receptor substrates, interference with insulin signaling mechanisms, decreased adiponectin production and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Advantages of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on insulin resistance have been demonstrated in animal models. SummaryThere may be a benefit of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in human insulin resistance states, but more clinical research is needed to explore these possibilities.",

The presence of multiple comorbidities often represents an obstacle for being admitted to clinical settings for the treatment of metabolic diseases.

The aims of this review paper were to review the intrinsic (anthropometrics, body composition) and extrinsic (comorbidities) determinants of disability in obese patients and to provide an up-to-date definition of hospital-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs for severely obese patients with comorbidities. Rehabilitation of such patients require a here-and-now multidimensional, comprehensive approach, where the intensity of rehabilitative treatments depends on the disability level and severity of comorbidities and consists of the simultaneous provision of physiotherapy, diet and nutritional support, psychological counselling, adapted physical activity, specific nursing in hospitals with appropriate organizational and structural competences.",

        "title": "Clinical Relevance of Local Renin Angiotensin Systems",
        "abstract": "The concept of a \u201clocal\u201d renin angiotensin system (RAS) can mean different things to different people. Its main purpose is to differentiate the \u201clocal\u201d RAS operating in tissues from the classical \u201ccirculating\u201d RAS, but it is difficult to differentiate between the two systems because of their extensive overlap. The circulating RAS comprises kidney-derived renin acting on liver-derived angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin (Ang) I that is converted to Ang II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). However, tissues are the main site of production of angiotensin peptides by the circulating RAS, whereby plasma-derived renin acts on plasma-derived angiotensinogen to generate Ang I, which is converted to Ang II by endothelial ACE (1\u20134). \n \nLocal RAS refers to tissue-based mechanisms of Ang peptide formation that operate separately from the circulating RAS. Although many different concepts of local RAS have been described, a key feature is the local synthesis of RAS components including angiotensinogen and enzymes such as renin that cleave angiotensinogen to produce Ang peptides independently of the circulating RAS. ACE and Ang II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors are invariably locally synthesized, but these are also components of the circulating RAS. Many other potential components of local RAS have been described that may contribute to tissue-specific mechanisms of Ang peptide formation, and that may either participate in disease processes or contribute to mechanisms that protect from tissue injury. These include the (pro)renin receptor (5), renin-independent mechanisms of Ang peptide generation from Ang- (1-12) (6), intracellular (or intracrine) RAS that may contribute to cardiovascular disease (7, 8), and AT2 receptors (7) and the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway (6\u20138) that may mediate therapeutic benefit in cardiovascular disease. In addition, novel Ang peptides with novel pharmacology, including Ang IV, Ang A, alamandine, and angioprotectin (6, 8), have the potential to contribute to disease or to protective mechanisms. Moreover, the brain RAS, including the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor and the Ang IV/insulin regulated aminopeptidase pathways may play a role in Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases (9). Local production of aldosterone may have a pathogenic role (7, 10), ACE, AT2 receptors, Ang-(1-7) and acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro may have a role in hematopoiesis (11), and the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway may contribute to fetal programing, reproduction, and cancer (6, 12). \n \nThis short opinion piece discusses the potential clinical relevance of local RAS. The challenge in demonstrating the independence of local from circulating RAS, and the potential interaction of ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) therapies with local RAS are discussed. Attempts to define local RAS that are independent of the circulating RAS have been primarily based on animal models and the clinical relevance of local RAS is uncertain. However, this area of research continues to evolve, and today\u2019s opinions may change as we gain better understanding of how these novel components and mechanisms impact on clinical medicine.",

        "abstract": "Although renin is a critical regulatory enzyme of the cardiovascular system, its roles in organogenesis and the establishment of cardiovascular homeostasis remain unclear. Mammalian renin-expressing cells are widespread in embryonic kidneys but are highly restricted, specialized endocrine cells in adults. With a functional pronephros, embryonic zebrafish are ideal for delineating the developmental functions of renin-expressing cells and the mechanisms governing renin transcription. Larval zebrafish renin expression originates in the mural cells of the juxtaglomerular anterior mesenteric artery and subsequently at extrarenal sites. The role of renin was determined by assessing responses to renin-angiotensin system blockade, salinity variation, and renal perfusion ablation. Renin expression did not respond to renal flow ablation but was modulated by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and altered salinity. Our data in larval fish are consistent with conservation of renin's physiological functions. Using transgenic renin reporter fish, with mindbomb and cloche mutants, we show that Notch signaling and the endothelium are essential for developmental renin expression. After inhibition of angiogenesis, renin-expressing cells precede angiogenic sprouts. Arising from separate lineages, but relying on mutual interplay with endothelial cells, renin-expressing cells are among the earliest mural cells observed in larval fish, performing both endocrine and paracrine functions.",

        "title": "Chronic Stimulation of Renin Cells Leads to Vascular Pathology",
        "abstract": "Experimental or spontaneous genomic mutations of the renin\u2013angiotensin system or its pharmacological inhibition in early life leads to renal abnormalities, including poorly developed renal medulla, papillary atrophy, hydronephrosis, inability to concentrate the urine, polyuria, polydipsia, renal failure, and anemia. At the core of such complex phenotype is the presence of unique vascular abnormalities: the renal arterioles do not branch or elongate properly and they have disorganized, concentric hypertrophy. This lesion has been puzzling because it is often found in hypertensive individuals whereas mutant or pharmacologically inhibited animals are hypotensive. Remarkably, when renin cells are ablated with diphtheria toxin, the vascular hypertrophy does not occur, suggesting that renin cells per se may contribute to the vascular disease. To test this hypothesis, on a Ren1c\u2212/\u2212 background, we generated mutant mice with reporter expression (Ren1c\u2212/\u2212;Ren1c-Cre;R26R.mTmG and Ren1c\u2212/\u2212;Ren1c-Cre;R26R.LacZ) to trace the fate of reninnull cells. To assess whether reninnull cells maintain their renin promoter active, we used Ren1c\u2212/\u2212;Ren1c-YFP mice that transcribe YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) directed by the renin promoter. We also followed the expression of Akr1b7 and miR-330-5p, markers of cells programmed for the renin phenotype. Contrary to what we expected, reninnull cells did not die or disappear. Instead, they survived, increased in number along the renal arterial tree, and maintained an active molecular memory of the myoepitheliod renin phenotype. Furthermore, null cells of the renin lineage occupied the walls of the arteries and arterioles in a chaotic, directionless pattern directly contributing to the concentric arterial hypertrophy.",

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting hepatic angiotensinogen (Agt) may provide long-lasting antihypertensive effects, but the optimal approach remains unclear. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a novel AGT siRNA in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were treated with vehicle, siRNA (10 mg/kg fortnightly; subcutaneous), valsartan (31 mg/kg per day; oral), captopril (100 mg/kg per day; oral), valsartan+siRNA, or captopril+valsartan for 4 weeks (all groups, n=8). Mean arterial pressure (recorded via radiotelemetry) was lowered the most by valsartan+siRNA (\u221268\u00b14 mm\u2009Hg), followed by captopril+valsartan (\u221254\u00b14 mm\u2009Hg), captopril (\u221223\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg), siRNA (\u221214\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg), and valsartan (\u221210\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg). siRNA and captopril monotherapies improved cardiac hypertrophy equally, but less than the dual therapies, which also lowered NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). Glomerular filtration rate, urinary NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), and albuminuria were unaffected by treatment. siRNA lowered circulating AGT by 97.9\u00b11.0%, and by 99.8\u00b10.1% in combination with valsartan. Although siRNA greatly reduced renal Ang (angiotensin) I, only valsartan+siRNA suppressed circulating and renal Ang II. This coincided with decreased renal sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3 and phosphorylated sodium chloride cotransporter abundances. Renin and plasma K+ increased with every treatment, but especially during valsartan+siRNA; no effects on aldosterone were observed. Collectively, these data indicate that Ang II elimination requires >99% suppression of circulating AGT. Maximal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, achieved by valsartan+siRNA, yielded the greatest reduction in blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas AGT lowering alone was as effective as conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Given its stable and sustained efficacy, lasting weeks, RNA interference may offer a unique approach to improving therapy adherence and treating hypertension.",

Here, we report the first-in-human study on the safety, tolerability, neurohumoral, renal, and blood pressure\u2013lowering properties of MANP in hypertension subjects. This was an open-label sequential single ascending dose design in which all subjects stopped all antihypertensive agents for 14 days before receiving a single subcutaneous injection of MANP. MANP was safe, well tolerated, activated cGMP, induced natriuresis, reduced aldosterone, and decreased blood pressure at or below the maximal tolerated dose. Thus, MANP has a favorable safety profile and produced expected pharmacological effects in human hypertension.

        "abstract": "Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition exerts cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, often on top of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. We investigated this in diabetic hypertensive (mREN2)27 rats. Methods: Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin and treated with vehicle, the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, or their combination. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by telemetry. Results: Diabetes resulted in albuminuria, accompanied by glomerulosclerosis, without a change in glomerular filtration rate. Empagliflozin did not lower BP, while valsartan did, and when combined the BP drop was largest. Only dual blockade reduced cardiac hypertrophy and prevented left ventricular dilatation. Valsartan, but not empagliflozin, increased renin, and the largest renin rise occurred during dual blockade, resulting in plasma angiotensin II [but not angiotensin-(1\u20137)] upregulation. In contrast, in the kidney, valsartan lowered angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1\u20137), and empagliflozin did not alter this. Although both valsartan and empagliflozin alone tended to diminish albuminuria, the reduction was significant only when both drugs were combined. This was accompanied by reduced glomerulosclerosis, no change in glomerular filtration rate, and a favorable expression pattern of fibrosis and inflammatory markers (including SGLT2) in the kidney. Conclusion: RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition display synergistic beneficial effects on BP, kidney injury and cardiac hypertrophy in a rat with hypertension and diabetes. The synergy does not involve upregulation of angiotensin-(1\u20137), but may relate to direct RAS-independent effects of empagliflozin in the heart and kidney.",
