        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the potential for additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy with the selective anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent etanercept and the anti-interleukin-1 agent anakinra.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred forty-four patients in whom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was active despite methotrexate therapy were treated with subcutaneous etanercept only (25 mg twice weekly), full-dosage etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day), or half-dosage etanercept (25 mg once weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day) for 6 months in a double-blind study at 41 centers in the US. Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

A one year prospective study was conducted on a group of patients (n:15). Mean duration disease was 6.46 years. Rhumatoid factor was present in 12 cases. Leflunomide was administered at a dos of 20mg/day following a loading dose of 100mg/day for three days. The efficacy of LEF was evaluated on clinical and biological parameters of RA evolutivity at one, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Our mean follow up period was about 8 months (2 to 12 months). Good prognostic indicators of disease progression were observed with LEF at one month and later in eleven cases with a good safety. Non serious adverse events were observed with LEF. Our result confirm that LEF may present another therapeutic choice that is efficacious for the long term treatment of refractory RA. Nonetheless, these results must be evaluated on a larger series.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 blockers in rheumatoid arthritis are known to increase the risk of serious infections defined as life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics. Recently, new biological agents have become available. Their safety is an important issue. Purpose: To assess if biological agents, ie rituximab, abatacept and anakinra increase the risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in published randomised controlled trials. Data source: A systematic review of the literature using PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane library and abstracts databases (American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings) was performed up to October 2007. This search was completed with data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and manufacturers. Data extraction: Three fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed to compare serious infection rates between each biological agent and placebo. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method with a continuity correction. Data synthesis: Twelve randomised controlled trials with data concerning serious infections were analysed (three for rituximab, five for abatacept and four for anakinra). They included 745 patients, 1960 patients, 2062 patients and 2112 patients treated by rituximab, abatacept, anakinra and placebo respectively. The overall pooled ORs did not reveal a statistically significant increased risk of serious infection for abatacept and rituximab; this risk was increased for high doses of anakinra (\u2a7e100 mg daily) versus low dose and placebo (ORs\u200a=\u200a9.63 (95% CI, 1.31 to 70.91) and 3.40 (95% CI, 1.11 to 10.46) respectively). Conclusions: These meta-analyses did not reveal a significant increase in the risk of serious infections during rituximab or abatacept treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, high doses of anakinra may increase this risk, especially when patients have comorbidity factors. Large studies must be performed to confirm this safety profile in daily practice.",

        "abstract": "Significant advances in our understanding of RA and its management have been made in the past decade, resulting in earlier intervention with biologic DMARDs, particularly in patients with evidence of aggressive, erosive disease. Here, one such biologic therapy, the T-cell co-stimulation modulator abatacept, is discussed, exploring clinical evidence published to date on its use in patients with very early arthritis/early RA who are MTX na\u00efve, and in patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists. Data from relevant clinical trials are overviewed, discussing the clinical efficacy of abatacept in early disease, the clinical outcomes over long-term treatment in different patient populations and the effects of abatacept on structural damage. Findings from integrated safety analyses of abatacept clinical trial data, representing 10\u2009366 patient-years of exposure are described, and clinically important safety events, including serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events, are highlighted. It is concluded that abatacept represents an effective treatment option with an established safety profile across different patient populations, including patients with both early and erosive RA and those with established disease. Furthermore, efficacy data from studies in patients with early disease suggest that the risk\u2013benefit profile of abatacept may be more favourable when introduced earlier in the treatment paradigm.",

        "abstract": "Peptide\u2013MHC (pMHC) multimers, in addition to being tools for tracking and quantifying antigen-specific T cells, can mediate downstream signaling after T-cell receptor engagement. In the absence of costimulation, this can lead to anergy or apoptosis of cognate T cells, a property that could be exploited in the setting of autoimmune disease. Most studies with class I pMHC multimers used noncovalently linked peptides, which can allow unwanted CD8+ T-cell activation as a result of peptide transfer to cellular MHC molecules. To circumvent this problem, and given the role of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in the development of type 1 diabetes, we designed a single-chain pMHC complex (scKd.IGRP) by using the class I MHC molecule H-2Kd and a covalently linked peptide derived from islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP206\u2013214), a well established autoantigen in NOD mice. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the peptide is presented in the groove of the MHC molecule in canonical fashion, and it was also demonstrated that scKd.IGRP tetramers bound specifically to cognate CD8+ T cells. Tetramer binding induced death of naive T cells and in vitro- and in vivo-differentiated cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and tetramer-treated cytotoxic T lymphocytes showed a diminished IFN-\u03b3 response to antigen stimulation. Tetramer accessibility to disease-relevant T cells in vivo was also demonstrated. Our study suggests the potential of single-chain pMHC tetramers as possible therapeutic agents in autoimmune disease. Their ability to affect the fate of naive and activated CD8+ T cells makes them a potential intervention strategy in early and late stages of disease.",

Overall drug survival was measured, along with specific reasons of discontinuation (inefficacy or adverse events). A first set of analyses using RA as reference category assessed the relationship between diagnosis and drug survival. A second set of analyses stratified by diagnosis (RA and SpA) used INF as reference drug. Adjustment for confounders was performed. The results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios (adjHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\n\n\nRESULTS\n2640 RA patients and 1220 SpA patients with a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 7.2-33.4) were included in the analyses. Patients with a diagnosis of SpA showed a lower risk of drug discontinuation with an adjHR (95%CI) of 0.81 (0.73, 0.90). In SpA, the subset of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) showed the best survival on treatment. In RA, both ETA and ADA showed a significantly lower probability of withdrawal when compared to INF [adjHR (95%CI) 0.46 (0.38, 0.56) and 0.68 (0.57, 0.81), respectively]. Similar results were found in SpA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug survival for SpA is longer than that in RA mainly due to the AS subgroup. In both RA and SpA, ETA and ADA showed a better retention on treatment when compared to INF.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important therapeutic advances obtained in the field of rheumatology is the availability of the so-called bio(techno)logical drugs, which have deeply changed treatment perspectives in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. According to the steadily increasing attention on gout, due to well-established prognostic and epidemiology implications, in the last 5 years, the same change of perspective has been observed also for this disease. In fact, several bio(techno)logical agents have been investigated both for the management of the articular gout symptoms, targeting mainly interleukin-1\u03b2, as well as urate-lowering therapies such as recombinant uricases. Among the IL-1\u03b2 inhibitors, the majority of studies involve drugs such as anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept, but other compounds are under development. Moreover, other potential targets have been suggested, as, for example, the TNF alpha and IL-6, even if data obtained are less robust than those of IL-1\u03b2 inhibitors. Regarding urate-lowering therapies, the recombinant uricases pegloticase and rasburicase clearly showed their effectiveness in gout patients. Also in this case, new compounds are under development. The aim of this review is to focus on the various aspects of different bio(techno)logical drugs in gouty patients.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims In some Western countries, up to 50% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have subclinical gut inflammation. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and severity of gut inflammation and to determine clinical factors associated with colonic inflammation in Korean AS patients who performed ileocolonoscopy without evidence of established inf lammatory bowel diseases before. Methods One hundred and eight AS patients who underwent ileocolonoscopy were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups based on gross ileocolonoscopic findings; patients with inflammatory lesions, and patients without inflammatory lesions. Results Inf lammatory lesions in ileocolonoscopic findings were found in 40 patients. The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score C-reactive protein was higher in the group with inflammatory lesions and gut lesions were found often in the terminal ileum. The risk of inflammatory lesions was higher for AS patients whose symptoms required ileocolonoscopy than for AS patients who underwent routine ileocolonoscopy screening (odds ratio, 3.96). However, abnormal lesions were detected also in 17.6% of the patients who underwent ileocolonoscopy for routine screening and most of them were erosion and ulcer. Among patients with inflammatory lesions (n = 40), 23 showed subclinical gut inflammation associated with AS and 17 were diagnosed finally as Crohn\u2019s disease (n = 12), intestinal tuberculosis (n = 4), and ulcerative colitis (n = 1). Conclusions Our findings suggest that ileocolonoscopy might be recommended regularly in AS patients even without gastrointestinal symptoms, especially in the patients with high AS activity.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Renal involvement was a common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Few reports have investigated the pathological characteristics and renal outcomes of AS patients with kidney disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological spectrums and the renal prognosis of AS patients with kidney disease. Methods: This retrospective and observational study was conducted working on 62 patients (47 males and 15 females) with a diagnosis of AS (ACR, 1984) and renal biopsies between 2008 and 2017. The histopathological findings and associated clinical manifestations were collected, and the renal prognoses of patients with kidney disease were evaluated too. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for the occurrence of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Results: Renal biopsy revealed that IgAN accounted for a majority (74.2%) of the kidney disease with AS, while membranous nephropathies, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and other lesions accounted for a small minority. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum immunoglobulin A >3.45 g/L and immunoglobulin G >9.06 g/L were risk factors for the occurrence of IgAN. With a median follow-up time of 24.3 months, 28 patients (50.9%) reached complete remission, 9 patients (16.4%) had partial remission, and 1 patient had an eGFR decline >30%. No difference was found in prognosis between IgAN and non-IgAN. Conclusion: IgAN occurred in 76.4% of the kidney disease with AS, and higher serum immunoglobulin A and G increased the risk for the occurrence of IgAN. The renal prognosis of kidney disease in AS was good.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the leading cause of adult-onset nephrotic syndrome, with primary MN of unclear cause accounting for 80% of cases. Retrospective clinical research reported that MN occurring in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients was triggered by nephrotoxic drugs or of unknown cause. However, whether RA or AS itself increases the risk of developing MN is unknown. Methods We conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal effects of RA or AS on MN using genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary analysis, and several supplementary analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the causal estimates. Results We obtained 30 valid instrumental variables (IVs) of RA and 16 valid IVs of AS from large-scale open-access GWASs. The genetically predicted RA significantly increased the risk of MN [IVW odds ratios (OR) = 1.327, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (1.124, 1.565), P = 8.051 \u00d7 10\u22124]. Three supplementary MR analyses provided the consistent positive causal effect of RA on MN (all P < 0.05). No horizontal pleiotropy was detected by MR Egger intercept analysis (P = 0.411). However, the genetically predicted AS had no causal effect on MN by IVW and supplementary analysis (all P > 0.05). Conclusions Genetically predicted RA could increase the risk of MN, but genetically predicted AS was not associated with MN. Screening for kidney involvement in RA patients should be noted, and active treatment of RA will reduce the public health burden of MN.",

        "abstract": "Key Clinical Message The coexistence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and PLA2R\u2010associated membranous nephropathy (MN) is uncommon. It is difficult to demonstrate whether the mechanisms of renal pathology are triggered by RA, but it has been observed that the pro\u2010inflammatory molecules present in RA increase the expression of PLA2R. Rituximab could be effective in both conditions. Abstract RA affects 0.5% of adults in our country. It is an inflammatory disease that predominantly affects the joints causing destruction of the articular cartilage. Approximately 50% of patients present extra\u2010articular manifestations. Renal involvement is relatively frequent and clinically significant because it worsens the course and mortality of the primary disease. The histological renal damage observed in these patients includes a wide variety of entities and histological patterns with both glomerular and tubulointerstitial involvement, with secondary MN being one of the most frequent. Coexistence with primary MN is rare. We present the case of a 46\u2010year\u2010old male recently diagnosed with RA who was referred to the nephrology department for renal function deterioration and subnephrotic proteinuria. The autoimmune study showed positive anti\u2010PLA2R. Due to the unusual association between both entities, it was decided to perform a renal biopsy which showed abundant spikes. The immunofluorescence study showed contiguous parietal IgG positivity (3+). Immunohistochemistry showed positive granular IgG4, confirming the diagnosis of PLA2R\u2010associated MN. MN is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. The determination of anti\u2010PLA2R has been a great advance in the rapid differential diagnosis of MN. In recent years, new target antigens associated with certain underlying pathologies have been discovered. However, PLA2R is not associated with any disease or exposure and therefore remains the antigen responsible for 80% of primary NMs. Anti\u2010PLA2R antibodies can be produced by loss of central or peripheral tolerance. Whether these mechanisms are triggered by RA itself is difficult to prove. The cytokine TNF\u2010like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) has been associated with RA. This proinflammatory molecule increases the expression of PLA2R in podocytes, sensitizing them to the damaging action of anti\u2010PLA2Rs, which could justify a causal relationship between the two pathologies. The anti\u2010PLA2R positivity in a patient with membranous nephropathy should not be sufficient to refrain from searching for a secondary cause, as a kidney biopsy is mandatory when another underlying disease coexists. Treatment should be tailored to the individual risk profile for progression. Rituximab could be an optimal option for both entities.",
