        "abstract": "AIM\nto confirm the beneficial effect of BMCs therapy over placebo in AMI patients with inclusion only to the randomized double blind placebo-controlled trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nwe searched multiple database (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL) through January 2011 for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of BMCs for the treatment of AMI. We subsequently performed a random-effect meta-analysis to assess the eligible studies included related to the primary outcomes (mean LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV changes from baseline) and secondary outcomes (all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, rehospitalization for HF).\n\n\nRESULTS\nten RCTs (total=906 patients) were included. BMCs therapy was proven superior to placebo regarding mean LVEF change (2.07%; 95% CI, 0.55% to 3.59%; [I2=57%; p=0.008]), LVESV (5.52 mL; 95% CI, -7.68 mL to -3.36 mL; [I2=16%; p<0.00001]), and LVEDV (3.08 mL; 95% CI, -5.57 mL to -0.58 mL; [I2=23%, p=0.02]) from baseline. BMCs therapy showed no difference with regards to mortality events when compared to placebo (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.35 to 2.94; [I2=0%; p=0.98]), but exerts protective effects toward recurrent MI (OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.09 to 2.16; [I2=8%; p=0.32]) and rehospitalization for HF (OR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.85; [I2=0%; p=0.24]). All outcomes were sustained for a long period of time (up to 5 years).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nthe resulting meta-analysis concluded that BMCs therapy consistently improves cardiac performance parameters (LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV) when compared to placebo, even after the establishment of primary intervention. It is also safe to use and prevents the development of recurrent MI and HF.",

        "title": "Challenges for heart disease stem cell therapy",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. The use of stem cells to improve recovery of the injured heart after myocardial infarction (MI) is an important emerging therapeutic strategy. However, recent reviews of clinical trials of stem cell therapy for MI and ischemic heart disease recovery report that less than half of the trials found only small improvements in cardiac function. In clinical trials, bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood cells were used as the source of stem cells delivered by intracoronary infusion. Some trials administered only a stem cell mobilizing agent that recruits endogenous sources of stem cells. Important challenges to improve the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for CVD include: (1) improved identification, recruitment, and expansion of autologous stem cells; (2) identification of mobilizing and homing agents that increase recruitment; and (3) development of strategies to improve stem cell survival and engraftment of both endogenous and exogenous sources of stem cells. This review is an overview of stem cell therapy for CVD and discusses the challenges these three areas present for maximum optimization of the efficacy of stem cell therapy for heart disease, and new strategies in progress.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) therapy and bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation on cell survival in myocardial tissues and on heart function in a rat model of heart failure (HF). Rat BMSCs were isolated, amplified and adherent cultured in vitro. A rat model of HF was established via the intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (Adriamycin). The rats were randomly divided into normal, HF, BMSC, rhBNP and BMSC plus rhBNP groups. The BMSCs were administered once via tail vein injection and rhBNP was infused via the jugular vein. Echocardiography and polygraphy were used to evaluate heart function. An enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration prior to and following intervention. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of the myocardium\u2011specific proteins GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA-4), connexin 43 (Cx43) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The results of cardiac echocardiography and the hemodynamic data show that various indicators of left ventricular systolic function in the BMSC plus rhBNP group were significantly improved compared with those in the other groups (P<0.05). No significant differences in the improvement of cardiac function were observed between the BMSC and rhBNP groups (P>0.05). Following treatment, a significant difference in BNP levels was observed between the BMSC plus rhBNP and the BMSC groups (P<0.05). The GATA-4, Cx43 and cTnI expression levels in the BMSC plus rhBNP group were higher than those in the BMSC group. Compared with rhBNP treatment, BMSC transplantation alone does not significantly improve heart function. However, combining rhBNP therapy and BMSC transplantation increases the expression levels of GATA-4 and other proteins to improve cardiac systolic and diastolic function.",
