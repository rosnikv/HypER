        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAzathioprine is useful as a steroid-sparing drug in patients with ulcerative colitis. Its role as monotherapy in the maintenance of disease remission has not been evaluated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this prospective, randomized, open-label study, 25 patients with severe ulcerative colitis received either azathioprine (2.5 mg/Kg/day; Group A, n = 12) or sulfasalazine (6 g/day; Group B, n = 13). All patients received oral corticosteroids in a tapering dosage schedule initially. Treatment failure was defined as either disease relapse or drug withdrawal because of adverse effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive of 12 patients in Group A and 8 of 13 patients in Group B had sustained remission during the stipulated study period of 18 months (p = ns). Two patients in Group A had to stop azathioprine because of adverse effects (bone marrow suppression and acute pancreatitis). In Group A, all patients who had treatment failure developed it in the first half of the study while in Group B treatment failure occurred in both halves.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe relapse rate of ulcerative colitis on maintenance therapy with azathioprine or sulfasalazine is comparable; there was a trend towards earlier treatment failure with azathioprine.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo evaluate the role of azathioprine (AZA) in Indian patients with ulcerative colitis over longer duration of time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred fifty six patients with ulcerative colitis who were treated with AZA from January 1995 to December 2003 were reviewed. The indications for its use were as follows: (1) steroid dependent and steroid refractory disease; (2) Azathioprine monotherapy for naive patients with severe disease; and (3) combination therapy (AZA + sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates) for naive patients with severe disease. The data included patient and disease demographics, efficacy and toxicity profile of AZA. Patients with a minimum duration of 6 mo use of AZA were included in this report.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf a total of 156 patients treated with AZA, 45 were excluded from analysis for the following reasons- (follow up less than 6 mo, n = 9; poor follow up, n = 18; adverse affects, n = 18). In steroid refractory/dependent group the mean number of relapses prior to and post initiation of AZA therapy were 3.28 (+/- 0.81) and 0.94 (+/- 0.29) respectively. Discontinuation of steroids could be accomplished in 12 of the 15 steroid dependent patients. The proportion of patients with sustained remission of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years duration were calculated. Eighteen patients experienced adverse effects necessitating withdrawal of AZA (pancreatitis, n = 7; hepatitis, n = 3; gastrointestinal intolerance, n = 2; alopecia, n = 2; and hematological, n = 4) while 13 patients needed dose reduction or temporary withdrawal of the drug.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAzathioprine is well tolerated and has therapeutic benefits lasting as long as 4 years. Adverse effects such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, cytopenias and gastrointestinal symptoms do occur but are controlled by drug withdrawal only.",

        "title": "The membrane-bound mucin Muc1 regulates T helper 17-cell responses and colitis in mice.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nT helper (Th) 17 cells produce the effector cytokine interleukin (IL)-17, along with IL-22, which stimulates colonic epithelial cells to produce a membrane-bound mucin, Muc1. Muc1 is a component of the colonic mucus, which functions as a lubricant and a physiologic barrier between luminal contents and mucosal surface. The gene MUC1 has been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease; we investigated the role of Muc1 in development of colitis in mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMuc1 and RAG1 were disrupted in mice (Muc/RAG double knockout mice); Th1-mediated colitis was induced by intravenous injection of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells. We also studied Th2-mediated colitis using mice with disruptions in Muc1 and T-cell receptor \u03b1 chain (Muc/TCR double knockout mice).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMuc1 deficiency led to the development of more severe forms of Th1- and Th2-induced colitis than controls. Loss of Muc1 increased colonic permeability and the Th17-cell, but not Th2 or Th1 cell, response in the inflamed colon. Loss of Muc1 also promoted expansion of an innate lymphoid cell population (Lin(-) ckit(-) Thy1(+) Sca1(+)) that produces IL-17. The expansion of Th17 adaptive immune cells and innate lymphoid cells required the commensal microbiota.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMuc1, which is up-regulated by Th17 signaling, functions in a negative feedback pathway that prevents an excessive Th17 cell response in inflamed colons of mice. Disruption of this negative feedback pathway, perhaps by variants in Muc1, might contribute to inflammatory bowel disease in patients.",

        "title": "The value of experimental models of colitis in predicting efficacy of biological therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases.",
        "abstract": "During the last decade, biological therapies have an increasing share in the modern therapeutics of various diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Animal models of IBD have often been used to identify the targets of biological therapies, to test their relevance to disease pathogenesis, to assess their therapeutic efficacy in vivo, and to check for drug toxicity. In the field of inflammatory diseases the majority of biologics under development have failed to reach the clinic. This review examines the ability of preclinical data from animal models of IBD to predict success or failure of biologics in human IBD. Specifically, it describes the murine models of IBD, the mechanism of disease induction, the phenotype of the disease, its relevance to human IBD, and the specific immunological features of disease pathogenesis in each model and mainly compares the results of the phase II and III trials of biologics in IBD with preclinical data obtained from studies in animal models. Finally, it examines the possible reasons for low success in translation from bench to bedside and offers some suggestions to improve translation rates.",

        "title": "Sialic acids in cancer biology and immunity.",
        "abstract": "During malignant transformation, glycosylation is heavily altered compared with healthy tissue due to differential expression of glycosyltransferases, glycosidases and monosaccharide transporters within the cancer microenvironment. One key change of malignant tissue glycosylation is the alteration of sialic acid processing that leads to a general upregulation of sialylated glycans (hypersialylation) on cell surfaces and an increased introduction of the non-human sialic acid N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) instead of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid into cell surface glycans. These changes have been shown to be the result of altered sialyltransferase and sialidase expression. Functionally, cancer-associated hypersialylation appears to directly impact tumor cell interaction with the microenvironment, in particular the modulation of sialic acid-binding lectins on immune cells. Moreover, Neu5Gc expression in human tissues enhances inflammation due to an anti-Neu5Gc immune response, which can potentially influence inflammation-induced cancer and cancer-associated inflammation. In this review, we summarize the changes of sialic acid biology within the malignant microenvironment and the resulting effect on cancer immunity.",

        "abstract": "Abnormally O-glycosylated MUC1 tandem repeat glycopeptide epitopes expressed by multiple types of cancer have long been attractive targets for therapy in the race against genetic mutations of tumor cells. Glycopeptide signature-guided therapy might be a more promising avenue than mutation signature-guided therapy. Three O-glycosylated peptide motifs, PDTR, GSTA, and GVTS, exist in a tandem repeat HGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA, containing five O-glycosylation sites. The exact peptide and sugar residues involved in antibody binding are poorly defined. Co-crystal structures of glycopeptides and respective monoclonal antibodies are very few. Here we review 3 groups of monoclonal antibodies: antibodies which only bind to peptide portion, antibodies which only bind to sugar portion, and antibodies which bind to both peptide and sugar portions. The antigenicity of peptide and sugar portions of glyco-MUC1 tandem repeat were analyzed according to available biochemical and structural data, especially the GSTA and GVTS motifs independent from the most studied PDTR. Tn is focused as a peptide-modifying residue in vaccine design, to induce glycopeptide-binding antibodies with cross reactivity to Tn-related tumor glycans, but not glycans of healthy cells. The unique requirement for the designs of antibody in antibody-drug conjugate, bi-specific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "MUC1 is a membrane glycoprotein, which in adenocarninomas is overexpressed and exhibits truncated O\u2010glycosylation. Overexpression and altered glycosylation make MUC1 into a candidate for immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against MUC1 frequently bind an immunodominant epitope that contains a single site for O\u2010glycosylation. Glycosylation with tumor carbohydrate antigens such as the Tn\u2010antigen (GalNAc\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr) results in antibodies binding with higher affinity. One proposed model to explain the enhanced affinity of antibodies for the glycosylated antigen is that the addition of a carbohydrate alters the conformational properties, favoring a binding\u2010competent state. The conformational effects associated with Tn glycosylation of the MUC1 antigen was investigated using solution\u2010state NMR and molecular dynamics. NMR experiments revealed distinct substructures of the glycosylated MUC1 peptides compared with the unglycosylated peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations of the MUC1 glycopeptide and peptide revealed distinguishing differences in their conformational preferences.",
