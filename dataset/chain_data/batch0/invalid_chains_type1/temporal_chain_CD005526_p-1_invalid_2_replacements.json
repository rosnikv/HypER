        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUrsodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) therapy leads to major improvements in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The benefit of long-term treatment is uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 145 patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis to receive ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (72 patients) or placebo (73 patients). After two years of follow-up, because of the benefit from ursodiol, all patients completing the study received ursodiol in an open trial and were monitored for two more years. The end points in the assessment of efficacy were as follows: progression of disease, as defined by the presence of hyperbilirubinemia, variceal bleeding, ascites, or encephalopathy; liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure; and liver transplantation (or a referral) or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDisease progressed significantly less frequently in the ursodiol group than in the placebo group (P < 0.002; relative risk, 0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.63). The probability of liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure and the probability of transplantation or death were significantly lower in the group assigned to ursodiol than in the group assigned to placebo (for transplantation alone, P = 0.003; relative risk, 0.21; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.66; for transplantation or death, P = 0.005; relative risk, 0.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.74). High bilirubin levels and, to a lesser extent, signs of cirrhosis at entry into the trial were predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or a referral, and transplantation or death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term ursodiol therapy slows the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis and reduces the need for liver transplantation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM\nUrsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment is an effective medical therapy for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however, 40% of PBC patients show an incomplete response to the UDCA therapy. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) transfusion in PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a single-arm trial that included seven PBC patients with a suboptimal response to UDCA treatment. UC-MSCs were first cultured, and then 0.5 \u00d7 10(6) cells/kg body weights were infused through a peripheral vein. UC-MSCs were given three times at 4-week intervals, and patients were followed up for 48 weeks. Primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of UC-MSC treatment, and secondary outcomes were to evaluate liver functions and patient's quality of life.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo obvious side-effects were found in the patients treated with UC-MSCs. Symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus were obviously alleviated in most patients after UC-MSC treatment. There was a significant decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels at the end of the follow-up period as compared with baseline. No significant changes were observed in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time activity, international normalized ratio, or immunoglobulin M levels. The Mayo risk score, a prognostic index, was also stable during the treatment and follow-up period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUC-MSC transfusion is feasible and well tolerated in patients with PBC who respond only partially to UDCA treatment, thus representing a novel therapeutic approach for patients in this subgroup. A larger, randomized controlled cohort study is warranted to confirm the clinical efficacy of UC-MSC transfusion.",

        "abstract": "Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a valuable cell source in regenerative medicine. Recently, several studies have shown that MSCs can be easily isolated from human amnion. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of transplantation of human amnion-derived MSCs (hAMSCs) in rats with liver fibrosis. Methods Liver fibrosis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL/kg of 50% carbon tetrachloride twice a week for 6 weeks. At 3 weeks, hAMSCs (1 \u00d7 106 cells) were transplanted intravenously. Rats were sacrificed at 7 weeks, and histological analyses and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of hAMSCs on the activation of Kupffer cells. Results Transplantation of hAMSCs significantly reduced the fibrotic area, deposition of type-I collagen, the number of &agr;-smooth muscle actin\u2013positive hepatic stellate cells, and CD68-positive Kupffer cells in the livers. messenger RNA expression of &agr;-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was significantly decreased and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and hepatocyte growth factor was significantly increased in the liver of hAMSC-treated rats. Transplantation of hAMSCs at 3 weeks plus 5 weeks did not have an additive effect. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Kupffer cell activation induced by lipopolysaccharide was significantly decreased by culturing with conditioned medium obtained from hAMSCs. Conclusions Transplantation of hAMSCs provided significant improvement in a rat model of liver fibrosis, possibly through the inhibition of Kupffer cell and hepatic stellate cell activation. hAMSCs may be a potential new treatment for liver fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is expected to provide a new strategy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large amounts of MSCs can be obtained from human amnion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of transplantation of human amnion-derived MSCs (hAMSCs) or enema of conditioned medium (CM) from hAMSCs into rats with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. In the first experiment, 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were intravenously injected with hAMSCs (1 \u00d7 106 cells) 3 h after rectal administration of TNBS (45 mg/kg). In the second experiment, rats with TNBS-induced colitis received CM by enema into the colon for 3 days. Colitis was investigated by endoscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and by measuring mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators. Administration of hAMSCs or CM enema significantly improved the endoscopic score. In addition, these two interventions resulted in significantly decreased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and decreased expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL1, and CCL2. In conclusion, transplantation of hAMSCs and CM enema provided significant improvement in rats with TNBS-induced colitis. CM from hAMSCs and hAMSCs may be new strategies for the treatment of IBD.",

Different sources of MSCs show different therapeutic properties. Engineering managements are able to enhance the immunomodulation function and the survival of MSCs involved in IBD. The therapeutic mechanism of MSCs in IBD mainly focuses on cell-to-cell contact and paracrine actions. One of the promising therapeutic options for IBD can focus on exosomes of MSCs. MSCs hold promise for the treatment of IBD-associated colorectal cancer because of their tumor-homing function and chronic inflammation inhibition. Encouraging results have been obtained from clinical trials in IBD and potential challenges caused by MSCs therapy are getting solved. This review can assist investigators better to understand the research progress for enhancing the efficacy of MSCs therapy involved in IBD and CAC.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) provides both structural support and dynamic microenvironment for cells regulating their behavior and fate. As a critical component of stem cell niche ECM maintains stem cells and activates their proliferation and differentiation under specific stimuli. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) regulate tissue-specific stem cell functions locating in their immediate microenvironment and producing various bioactive factors, including ECM components. We evaluated the ability of MSC-produced ECM to restore stem and progenitor cell microenvironment in vitro and analyzed the possible mechanisms of its effects. Human MSC cell sheets were decellularized by different agents (detergents, enzymes, and apoptosis inductors) to select the optimized combination (CHAPS and DNAse I) based on the conservation of decellularized ECM (dECM) structure and effectiveness of DNA removal. Prepared dECM was non-immunogenic, supported MSC proliferation and formation of larger colonies in colony-forming unit-assay. Decellularized ECM effectively promoted MSC trilineage differentiation (adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic) compared to plastic or plastic covered by selected ECM components (collagen, fibronectin, laminin). Interestingly, dECM produced by human fibroblasts could not enhance MSC differentiation like MSC-produced dECM, indicating cell-specific functionality of dECM. We demonstrated the significant integrin contribution in dECM-cell interaction by blocking the stimulatory effects of dECM with RGD peptide and suggested the involvement of key intracellular signaling pathways activation (pERK/ERK and pFAK/FAK axes, pYAP/YAP and beta-catenin) in the observed processes based on the results of inhibitory analysis. Taken together, we suppose that MSC-produced dECM may mimic stem cell niche components in vitro and maintain multipotent progenitor cells to insure their effective response to external differentiating stimuli upon activation. The obtained data provide more insights into the possible role of MSC-produced ECM in stem and progenitor cell regulation within their niches. Our results are also useful for the developing of dECM-based cell-free products for regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "Modern biomedical science still experiences a significant need for easy and reliable sources of human cells. They are used to investigate pathological processes underlying disease, conduct pharmacological studies, and eventually applied as a therapeutic product in regenerative medicine. For decades, the pool of adult mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) remains a promising source of stem and progenitor cells. Their isolation is more feasible than most other stem cells from human donors, yet they have a fair share of drawbacks. They include significant variability between donors, loss of potency, and transformation during long-term culture, which may impact the efficacy and reproducibility of research. One possible solution is a derivation of immortalized MSCs lines which receive a broader use in many medical and biological studies. In the present work, we demonstrated that in the most widely spread commercially available hTERT-immortalized MSCs cell line ASC52telo, sensitivity to hormonal stimuli was reduced, affecting their differentiation efficacy. Furthermore, we found that immortalized MSCs have impaired insulin-dependent and cAMP-dependent signaling, which impairs their adipogenic, but not osteogenic or chondrogenic, potential under experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that hTERT-immortalized MSCs may present a suboptimal choice for studies involving modeling or investigation of hormonal sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Replicative senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) caused by repeated cell culture undermines their potential as a cell therapy because of the reduction in their proliferation and therapeutic potential. Glutaminase-1 (GLS1) is reported to be involved in the survival of senescent cells, and inhibition of GLS1 alleviates age-related dysfunction via senescent cell removal. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the association between MSC senescence and GLS1. We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the effect of GLS1 inhibition on senolysis and the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Inhibition of GLS1 in Wharton\u2019s jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) reduced the expression of aging-related markers, such as p16, p21, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype genes, by senolysis. Replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs, which recovered after short-term treatment with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES), showed increased proliferation and therapeutic effects compared to those observed with senescent WJ-MSCs. Moreover, compared to senescent WJ-MSCs, replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs inhibited apoptosis in serum-starved C2C12 cells, enhanced muscle formation, and hindered apoptosis and fibrosis in mdx mice. These results imply that GLS1 inhibition can ameliorate the therapeutic effects of senescent WJ-MSCs in patients with muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, GLS1 is a key factor in modulating the senescence mechanism of MSCs, and regulation of GLS1 may enhance the therapeutic effects of senescent MSCs, thereby increasing the success rate of clinical trials involving MSCs.",
