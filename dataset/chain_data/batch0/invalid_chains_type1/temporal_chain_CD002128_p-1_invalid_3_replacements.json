        "abstract": "The effects of ovarian suppression by oral contraceptives as well as hormone replacement therapy were studied on hormone levels and on products of hormone action in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) from breasts of pre- and postmenopausal women. Multiple samples per subject revealed high consistency (intraclass correlation coefficients) for all products measured. Compared with premenopausal women, NAF progesterone was much lower in postmenopausal women, but NAF androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations were not different. With oral contraceptive use, estradiol, estrone sulfate, and progesterone levels were similarly lower in serum and NAF. In postmenopausal women, NAF estradiol and estrone sulfate were not significantly less than those in premenopausal women, nor were epidermal growth factor or cathepsin D levels, but IL-6 was elevated. Despite corresponding changes in hormones in serum and NAF over time, correlations based on simultaneous sampling were not significant. It is concluded that: 1) potential precursors of estradiol remain at comparable levels in the breast after menopause; 2) local synthesis is important for maintenance of estradiol levels in NAF of postmenopausal women but less important for progesterone; and 3) changes in the serum parameters are accurately reflected in NAF, but only after a matter of days. These findings provide additional validation for the physiological relevance of NAF hormone levels as potential breast cancer risk markers.",

        "title": "Phytoestrogen Exposure Is Associated with Circulating Sex Hormone Levels in Postmenopausal Women and Interact with ESR1 and NR1I2 Gene Variants",
        "abstract": "In this large cross-sectional study, we investigated the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in 1988 healthy postmenopausal women and their interactions with polymorphisms in genes involved in estrogen signaling. Plasma estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, and SHBG were measured. Urinary levels of five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, and equol) and two lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) were measured and used as biomarkers for dietary intakes. Eighteen polymorphisms in ESR1, ESR2, and NR1I2 genes were genotyped. Results showed that lignans were positively associated with plasma SHBG levels (\u03b7p2 = 1.2%; P < 0.001) and negatively associated with plasma testosterone (\u03b7p2 = 0.2%; P = 0.042). Equol was negatively associated with plasma estradiol levels (\u03b7p2 = 0.3%; P = 0.028), whereas O-desmethylangolensin was positively associated with plasma estradiol level (\u03b7p2 = 0.3%; P = 0.010). There were significant phytoestrogen interactions with polymorphisms in ESR1 and NR1I2 genes in affecting estrone levels. We conclude that phytoestrogens modulate sex hormone and SHBG levels in postmenopausal women and interact with gene variants involved in estrogen signaling. Such phytoestrogen-gene interactions may explain the conflicting literature on the hormonal effects of phytoestrogens. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(5):1009\u201316)",

        "abstract": "Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, existing analyses have focused on only one class of these compounds in plant-based foods, and there is only little information on foods of animal origin, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first comprehensive study of phytoestrogen content in animal food. We have determined the phytoestrogen content (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, genistein, and glycitein; lignans: secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol; coumestrol; equol; enterolactone; and enterodiol) in 115 foods of animal origin (including milk and milk-products, eggs, meat, fish, and seafood) and vegetarian substitutes using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with (13)C-labeled internal standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed; the average content was 20 microg/100 g of wet weight (isoflavones, 6 microg/100 g; lignans, 6 microg/100 g; equol, 3 microg/100 g; and enterolignans, 6 microg/100 g). In infant soy formula, 19 221 microg/100 g phytoestrogens were detected (compared to 59 microg/100 g in non-soy formula). Our study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens and most foods (except for fish, seafood, and butter) contained mammalian phytoestrogens (enterolignans and equol). This is the first comprehensive study of phytoestrogen content of foods of animal origin and will allow for a more accurate estimation of exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.",

We calculated pooled risk estimates (REs) for total lignan exposure, dietary lignan intake, enterolignan exposure, and blood or urine concentrations of enterolactone and according to menopausal and estrogen receptor (ER) status of tumors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 21 studies (11 prospective cohort studies and 10 case-control studies) in the meta-analyses. Lignan exposure was not associated with an overall breast cancer risk (RE: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.02; P for heterogeneity = 0.004). However, in postmenopausal women, high lignan intake was associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer (13 studies; RE: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.94; P for heterogeneity = 0.32). Breast cancer risk was also inversely associated with enterolignan exposure (4 studies; RE: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) but not with blood or urine enterolactone concentrations. The associations were not significantly different between ER-status subgroups (6 studies).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh lignan exposure may be associated with a reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Additional work is warranted to clarify the association between lignan exposure and breast cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nLignans--plant-derived compounds with estrogen-dependent and -independent anticarcinogenic properties--have been associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but data are limited regarding their effect on survival. Dietary lignans are metabolized to enterolignans, which are subsequently absorbed and become bioavailable.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe assessed the prognosis of 1,140 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer age 50 to 74 years who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2005. Vital status through the end of 2009 was ascertained via local population registries, and deaths were verified by death certificates. Information on recurrences and secondary tumors was verified by clinical records and attending physicians. Associations of postdiagnostic serum enterolactone (a biomarker for dietary lignans) with overall survival and distant disease-free survival were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian enterolactone levels for deceased patients and those still alive were 17.0 and 21.4 nmol/L, respectively. During a median of 6.1 years of follow-up after diagnosis, 162 deaths were confirmed. Higher serum enterolactone levels were associated with significantly reduced hazard ratios (HRs) for death (HR per 10 nmol/L increment, 0.94; P = .04; HR for the highest quartile, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.99). For distant disease, HR was 0.94 per 10 nmol/L increment (P = .08) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.09) for the highest quartile. The highest quartile of serum enterolactone was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death only for estrogen receptor-negative tumors (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.87) but not for estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.84: P for heterogeneity = .09).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPostmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have high serum enterolactone levels may have better survival.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nSex steroid exposure increases the risk of breast cancer by unclear mechanisms. Diet modifications may be one breast cancer prevention strategy. The proinflammatory cytokine family of IL-1 is implicated in cancer progression. IL-1Ra is an endogenous inhibitor of the proinflammatory IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to elucidate whether estrogen, tamoxifen, and/or diet modification altered IL-1 levels in normal human breast tissue.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nMicrodialysis was performed in healthy women under various hormone exposures, tamoxifen therapy, and diet modifications and in breast cancers of women before surgery. Breast tissue biopsies from reduction mammoplasties were cultured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe show a significant positive correlation between estradiol and in vivo levels of IL-1\u03b2 in breast tissue and abdominal sc fat, whereas IL-1Ra exhibited a significant negative correlation with estradiol in breast tissue. Tamoxifen or a dietary addition of 25 g flaxseed per day resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-1Ra in the breast. These results were confirmed in ex vivo culture of breast biopsies. Immunohistochemistry of the biopsies did not reveal any changes in cellular content of the IL-1s, suggesting that mainly the secreted levels were affected. In breast cancer patients, intratumoral levels of IL-1\u03b2 were significantly higher compared with normal adjacent breast tissue.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIL-1 may be under the control of estrogen in vivo and may be attenuated by antiestrogen therapy and diet modifications. The increased IL-1\u03b2 in breast cancers of women strongly suggests IL-1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment and prevention.",

        "abstract": "Nontransformed breast epithelial cells that are adjacent to tumor cells are constantly exposed to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), two inflammatory cytokines identified as having pro-tumoral causative roles. We show that continuous stimulation of nontransformed breast epithelial cells by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 for 2 to 3 weeks induced their spreading and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanistic bases for this slow induction of EMT by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 are: 1) it took 2 to 3 weeks for the cytokines to induce the expression of the EMT activators Zeb1 and Snail; 2) although Twist has amplified the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail, its expression was reduced by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2; however, the lack of Twist was compensated by prolonged stimulation with TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 that has potentiated the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail. Stimulation by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 has induced the following dissemination-related properties in the nontransformed cells: 1) up-regulation of functional matrix metalloproteinases; 2) induction of migratory and invasive capabilities; 3) disruption of the normal phenotype of organized three-dimensional acini structures typically formed only by nontransformed breast cells and spreading of nontransformed cells out of such acini. Our findings suggest that TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 induce dissemination of nontransformed breast epithelial cells and their reseeding at the primary tumor site; if, then, such detached cells are exposed to transforming events, they may form secondary malignant focus and lead to disease recurrence. Thus, our study reveals novel pathways through which the inflammatory microenvironment may contribute to relapsed disease in breast cancer.",

Genetic and epigenetic modifications shift cells toward either end of the EMT spectrum, and can be influenced by the microenvironment surrounding a tumor. EMT and mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition are critical to normal function and development and an intricate network of transcription factors and transcriptional regulators tightly regulates these processes. As evidenced in normal and transformed cell lines, many signaling pathways trigger EMT during development and differentiation. The signaling pathways include those triggered by different members of the transforming growth factor superfamily, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor, Wnt, Notch, and many others. Functional redundancies allow cells to undergo EMT even if these key transcriptional regulators are lacking, but these same redundancies also make these pathways particularly susceptible to gain-of-function mutations or constitutive signal activation; the \u201cforced\u201d transition toward either a mesenchymal or epithelial phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induces epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between S1P and syndecan-1 in HCC, the molecular mechanism involved, as well as their roles in EMT of HCC. Results revealed a high serum S1P level presents in patients with HCC, which positively correlated with the serum syndecan-1 level. A significant inverse correlation existed between S1P1 and syndecan-1 in HCC tissues. S1P elicits activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways via S1P1, which triggers HPSE, leading to increases in expression and activity of MMP-7 and leading to shedding and suppression of syndecan-1. The loss of syndecan-1 causes an increase in TGF-\u03b21 production. The limited chronic increase in TGF-\u03b21 can convert HCC cells into a mesenchymal phenotype via establishing an MMP-7/Syndecan-1/TGF-\u03b2 autocrine loop. Finally, TGF-\u03b21 and syndecan-1 are essential for S1P-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our study demonstrates that S1P induces advanced tumor phenotypes of HCC via establishing an MMP-7/syndecan-1/TGF-\u03b21 autocrine loop, and implicates targetable S1P1-PI3K/AKT-HPSE-MMP-7 signaling axe in HCC metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) are complex unbranched carbohydrate chains that are heavily modified by sulfate and exist either conjugated to proteins or as free, unconjugated chains. Proteins with covalently bound Heparan sulfate chains are termed Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). Both HS and HSPGs bind to various growth factors and act as co-receptors for different cell surface receptors. They also modulate the dynamics and kinetics of various ligand-receptor interactions, which in turn can influence the duration and potency of the signaling. HS and HSPGs have also been shown to exert a structural role as a component of the extracellular matrix, thereby altering processes such as cell adhesion, immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that HS are deregulated in a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and regulate key aspects of cancer initiation and progression. HS deregulation in cancer can occur as a result of changes in the level of HSPGs or due to changes in the levels of HS biosynthesis and remodeling enzymes. Here, we describe the major cell-autonomous (proliferation, apoptosis/senescence and differentiation) and cell-non-autonomous (angiogenesis, immune evasion, and matrix remodeling) roles of HS and HSPGs in cancer. Finally, we discuss therapeutic opportunities for targeting deregulated HS biosynthesis and HSPGs as a strategy for cancer treatment.",
