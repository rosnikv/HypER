        "abstract": "Cyclooxygenases are responsible for the biosynthesis of prostanoids, the overt presence of which is often associated with inflammation and pain. Since the discovery of COX-2 in the last decade, a myriad of selective COX-2 inhibitors and their pharmacological profiles have been witnessed. Pharmacological observations of selective inhibition of COX-2 often go beyond initial expectations. This review is an overview of issues on selective COX-2 inhibitors, which include gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety, emerging therapeutic areas and differentiation in drug profiles expected to be addressed by future generation COX-2 inhibitors. This article also covers recent patents and papers on new COX-2 inhibitors published since 2002. Future generation COX-2 inhibitors are sure to be safer and meet better medical needs than the COX-2 inhibitors currently available for the treatment or prevention of broadly ranged COX-2-mediated disorders.",

        "title": "Etoricoxib for arthritis and pain management",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, have come to play an important role in the pharmacologic management of arthritis and pain. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of etoricoxib in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, low back pain, acute postoperative pain, and primary dysmenorrhea. Comparative studies indicate at least similar efficacy with etoricoxib versus traditional NSAIDs. Etoricoxib was generally well tolerated in these studies with no new safety findings during long-term administration. The gastrointestinal, renovascular, and cardiovascular tolerability profiles of etoricoxib have been evaluated in large patient datasets, and further insight into the cardiovascular tolerability of etoricoxib and diclofenac will be gained from a large ongoing cardiovascular outcomes program (MEDAL). The available data suggest that etoricoxib is an efficacious alternative in the management of arthritis and pain, with the potential advantages of convenient once-daily administration and superior gastrointestinal tolerability compared with traditional NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Gastrotoxicity is a major problem for long-term therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). DICCIC (1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2-one) is a new diclofenac prodrug, which has proven anti-inflammatory activity without gastroulcerogenic effect. The aim of this work was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac from DICCIC (7.6 mg/kg equivalent to 8.1 mg/kg diclofenac) and diclofenac (8.1 mg/kg) administration in Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g (n=20). The doses were calculated by interspecific allometric scaling based on the 2 mg/kg from diary human dose of diclofenac. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes via the femoral artery through the implanted catheter. The plasma was separated and quantitation was made in a HPLC system with a UV-Vis detector. The confidence limits of the bioanalytical method were appropriate for its application in a preclinical pharmacokinetic study. The AUC of diclofenac from DICCIC (53.7\u00b1 5.8 ug/mL.min) was significantly less (Mann Whitney test, p<0.05) than that of diclofenac from diclofenac administration (885.9 \u00b1 124,8 ug/mL.min). Terminal half-life of diclofenac from DICCIC (50.1 \u00b1 17.2 min) was significantly less (Mann Whitney test, p<0.05) than that of diclofenac from diclofenac administration (247.4 \u00b1 100.9 min). Still the parameters clearance and distribution volume were calculated for diclofenac from diclofenac, whose results were 9.2 \u00b11.2 mL/min.kg and 3.3 \u00b11.2 L/kg, respectively. The results of DICCIC from DICCIC administration were 108.9 \u00b1 19.6 mL/min.kg and 7.8 \u00b1 2.4 L/kg for clearance and distribution volume, respectively. The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated that there was an increase in diclofenac elimination and a lower exposure to diclofenac with administration of DICCIC compared to diclofenac.",

The activity of axSpA (BASDAI, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) was evaluated at baseline, 2 and 12 weeks; adverse events were recorded at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. The number of patients who had achieved an ASAS40 response at 2 and 12 weeks were taken into consideration. RESULTS At 12 weeks, the continuous administration group displayed decreases in BASDAI from 8 to 4, in ASDAS from 3.8 to 2.6, and in hs-CRP levels from 9.5 to 3.9 mg/l; the intermittent administration group exhibited decreases in BASDAI from 7.6 to 6.0, in ASDAS from 3.5 to 3.1, and hs-CRP from 8.8 to 4.5 mg/l (p<0.05). At this time, an AS40 response was achieved by 22 (73.3%) and 2 (20%) patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.05 for all). No serious adverse events were recorded.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe efficacy of ET given in a daily dose of 90 mg was much higher than that of the drug used thrice or less weekly in the patients with axSpA.",

Osteoarthritis (OA) in the Russian Federation is still not included in the list of socially significant diseases, despite the fact that this pathology limits the level of physical activity of the population more than diseases of the cardiovascular system, visual impairment and diabetes. European experts emphasize the relevance of research to develop methods to improve the effectiveness of viscosupplementary therapy in OA. The purpose of the study. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and long-term results of treatment of gonarthrosis with sodium hyaluronate.Materials and methods. The study included 180 patients with gonarthrosis with insufficient efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on demand and oral symptomatic slow-acting drugs against osteoarthritis (SYSADOA). The patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1: 50 patients who received sodium hyaluronate (Ripart\u00ae; Ingal, Russia) intra-articularly. Group 2: 30 patients received intra-articular SYSADOA (bioactive concentrate of small marine fish). The control group consisted of 100 patients who received drugs of the SYSADOA group intramuscularly.Results. An effective reduction in pain both at rest and during movement was achieved in most patients of all groups, but the treatment groups differed statistically significantly in the speed of achieving the clinical effect and its duration. In the 1st group, a significant decrease in the VAS pain index was observed already at the 1st week and by the 3rd month it was \u201349.1 % (p < 0.001). In the comparison and control groups, the indicators of speed, the degree of pain reduction, and the duration of the effect of therapy were also significant (p \u2264 0.050). But the effectiveness of therapy in these groups was statistically significantly lower than in patients of group 1 (p \u2265 0.050). It should be emphasized that the intra-articular administration of sodium hyaluronate provided a significant reduction in the need for patients to additionally take NSAIDs. After 3 months of therapy, only 5 patients (10 %) of this group continued to take NSAIDs (p < 0.001); 20 \u2013 completely stopped taking NSAIDs (40 %) and 25 (50 %) reduced the dose of NSAIDs taken, the duration of the effect lasted up to 12 months.Conclusions. In our study, sodium hyaluronate demonstrated high efficiency in reducing pain in patients with gonarthrosis and contributed to a significant decrease in the need for patients to take NSAIDs for 12 months.",
