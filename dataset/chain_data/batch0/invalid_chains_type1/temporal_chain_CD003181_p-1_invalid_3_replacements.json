        "title": "Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) treatment on chronic viral hepatitis in heart transplant patients: results of a prospective, double-blind, placebo-randomized study",
        "abstract": "Background. Chronic viral hepatitis averages 15% to 20% in heart transplant patients. Several studies have shown that ursodiol may improve liver biochemistry in patients with chronic hepatitis. We used a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of ursodiol in heart transplant patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Methods. Thirty heart patients with chronic viral hepatitis B, C, or non-A-G received ursodiol, 800 mg per day (group 1), and 30 received placebo (group 2) for 12 months. Endpoints were improvement in liver biochemical tests and in total Knodell score. Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Results. At entry, both groups were comparable for all of the studied parameters. During the study period, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and &ggr;-glutamyl transpeptidase variations were not different between group 1 and group 2 patients. Knodell score improved in 20% of group 1 patients and in 43% of group 2 patients (NS). Adverse events or mortality were not different in the two groups during the study period. Similar results were observed by intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Conclusions. A 12-month course of ursodiol therapy had no effect on liver enzymes or liver histology in heart transplant patients with chronic hepatitis.",

        "title": "Impact of Hepatitis C Infection on Outcomes After Heart Transplantation",
        "abstract": "Background. Prevalence of hepatitis C infection (HCV) among heart transplant (OHT) recipients ranges from 7% to 18%. Despite the paucity of data regarding the outcomes of heart transplant recipients who are HCV positive before transplant, many transplant centers are declining to perform OHT in HCV-seropositive patients. Methods. We assessed the clinical outcome of HCV-seropositive compared with HCV-seronegative heart transplant recipients using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network/the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005, 224 HCV-seropositive and 10,406 HCV-seronegative recipients who received HCV-seronegative donor organs were identified. Results. Overall patient survival rates of HCV-seropositive recipients were significantly lower than those of HCV-seronegative recipients (84.8% at 1 year, 77.1% 3 years, 68.9% 5 years for HCV-seropositive group vs. 87.9% at 1 year, 80.7% 3 years, and 74.1% 5 years for HCV-negative recipients, log rank P=0.036). However, adjusted relative risk of recipient HCV-seropositive versus HCV-seronegative status did not reach to statistical significance level (relative risk=1.23 with P=0.087) after adjusting for other donor and recipient factors. Causes of death among HCV-seropositive and HCV-seronegative groups were similar. Cumulative incidence of an acute rejection episode in the first year after transplantation among HCV-seropositive recipients was 35.7% versus 32.6% HCV-seronegative recipients (P=0.32). Conclusions. A more rational approach should be developed for the management of HCV-seropositive heart transplant candidates. Carefully selected HCV-seropositive patients should not be excluded from OHT.",

        "title": "Outcomes After Lung Transplantation and Practices of Lung Transplant Programs in the United States Regarding Hepatitis C Seropositive Recipients",
        "abstract": "Background. The estimated prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among lung transplant (LT) recipients is 1.9%. Many thoracic transplant programs are reluctant to transplant HCV-seropositive patients due to concerns of hepatic dysfunction caused by immunosuppression. The aims of this study are to survey current practices of US LT programs regarding HCV-seropositive patients and using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database and to assess the clinical outcomes of HCV-positive compared with HCV-negative LT recipients. Methods. A survey of US transplant centers that have performed more than 100 LTs was conducted. In addition, 170 HCV-seropositive and 9259 HCV-seronegative recipients who received HCV-seronegative donor organs between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, were identified from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database. Outcome variables including patient survival were compared between the two groups. Results. A total of 64.4% centers responded to the survey. Ten of 29 (34.5%) programs would not consider HCV-seropositive patients for LT. Among the 19 programs that will consider HCV-seropositive patients, only five centers would transplant actively viremic patients. Overall patient survival rates of HCV-seropositive patients were similar to HCV-seronegative patients (84.7% at 1 year, 63.9% at 3 years, 49.4% at 5 years for HCV-seropositive group vs. 82.0% at 1 year, 65.0% at 3 years, 51.4% at 5 years for HCV-seronegative group, P=0.712). Relative risk of recipients for death remained statistically insignificant after adjusting for recipient age, donor age, obesity, sensitization, serum creatinine, and medical condition at time of transplant (relative risk [RR]=1.07 [0.84\u20131.38], P=0.581). Conclusions. Since 2000, patient survival rates of HCV-positive patients are identical to those who are HCV-negative. However, most of these HCV-seropositive patients were probably nonviremic.",

        "abstract": "Use of organs from donors testing positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may safely expand the donor pool. The American Society of Transplantation convened a multidisciplinary expert panel that reviewed the existing literature and developed consensus recommendations for recipient management following the use of organs from HBV positive donors. Transmission risk is highest with liver donors and significantly lower with non\u2010liver (kidney and thoracic) donors. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of transmission to liver recipients from isolated HBV core antibody positive (anti\u2010HBc+) donors. Organs from anti\u2010HBc+ donors should be considered for all adult transplant candidates after an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits and appropriate patient consent. Indefinite antiviral prophylaxis is recommended in liver recipients with no immunity or vaccine immunity but not in liver recipients with natural immunity. Antiviral prophylaxis may be considered for up to 1 year in susceptible non\u2010liver recipients but is not recommended in immune non\u2010liver recipients. Although no longer the treatment of choice in patients with chronic HBV, lamivudine remains the most cost\u2010effective choice for prophylaxis in this setting. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is not recommended.",

        "abstract": "Oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are currently the backbone of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection treatment. They are generally well-tolerated by patients and safe to use. To date, a significant number of patients have been treated with NAs. Safety data has accumulated over the years. The aim of this article is to review and update the adverse effects of oral NAs. NAs can cause class adverse effects (i.e., myopathy, neuropathy, lactic acidosis) and dissimilar adverse effects. All NAs carry a \u201cBlack Box\u201d warning because of the potential risk for mitochondrial dysfunction. However, these adverse effects are rarely reported. The majority of cases are associated with lamivudine and telbivudine. Adefovir can lead to dose- and time-dependent nephrotoxicity, even at low doses. Tenofovir has significant renal and bone toxicity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, bone and renal toxicity in patients with CHB are not as prominent as in HIV infection. Entecavir and lamivudine are not generally associated with renal adverse events. Entecavir has been claimed to increase the risk of lactic acidosis in decompensated liver disease and high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores. However, current studies reported that entecavir could be safely used in decompensated cirrhosis. An increase in fetal adverse events has not been reported with lamivudine, telbivudine and tenofovir use in pregnant women, while there is no adequate data regarding entecavir and adefovir. Further long-term experience is required to highlight the adverse effects of NAs, especially in special patient populations, including pregnant women, elderly and patients with renal impairment.",

        "abstract": "Background With the development of sequencing technology, several signatures have been reported for the prediction of prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the above signatures are characterized by cumbersome application. Therefore, the study is aimed at screening out a robust stratification system based on only one gene to guide treatment. Methods Firstly, we used the limma package for performing differential expression analysis on 374 HCC samples, followed by Cox regression analysis on overall survival (OS) and disease-free interval (PFI). Subsequently, hub prognostic genes were found at the intersection of the above three groups. In addition, the topological degree inside the PPI network was used to screen for a unique hub gene. The rms package was used to construct two visual stratification systems for OS and PFI, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to investigate survival differences in clinical subgroups. The ssGSEA algorithm was then used to reveal the relationship between the hub gene and immune cells, immunological function, and checkpoints. In addition, we also used function annotation to explore into putative biological functions. Finally, for preliminary validation, the hub gene was knocked down in the HCC cell line. Results We discovered 6 prognostic genes (SKA1, CDC20, AGTRAP, BIRC5, NEIL3, and CDC25C) for constructing a PPI network after investigating survival and differential expression genes. According to the topological degree, AGTRAP was chosen as the basis for the stratification system, and it was revealed to be a risk factor with an independent prognostic value in Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis (P < 0.05). In addition, we constructed two visualized nomograms based on AGTRAP. The novel stratification system had a robust predictive value for PFI and OS in ROC analysis and calibration curve (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, AGTRAP upregulation was associated with T staging, N staging, M staging, pathological stage, grade, and vascular invasion (P < 0.05). Notably, AGTRAP was overexpressed in tumor tissues in all pancancers with paired samples (P < 0.05). Furthermore, AGTRAP was associated with immune response and may change immune microenvironment in HCC (P < 0.05). Next, gene enrichment analysis suggested that AGTRAP may be involved in the biological process, such as cotranslational protein targeting to the membrane. Finally, we identified the oncogenic effect of AGTRAP by qRT-PCR, colony formation, western blot, and CCK-8 assay (P < 0.05). Conclusion We provided robust evidences that a stratification system based on AGTRAP can guide survival prediction for HCC patients.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aim Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection is important for long-term outcomes following liver transplantation (LT). Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is used among recipients who have (i) native HBV disease, (ii) hepatitis B core antibody positivity (HBcAb positivity), or (iii) received HBcAb positive organs. Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) monotherapy is emerging for treating patients in this setting. There is no generalized consensus on the ideal dosage of HBIG. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose HBIG (1560 international unit [IU]) for post-LT HBV prevention. Materials and Methods HBcAb positive patients who received either HBcAb positive or hepatitis B core antibody negative (HBcAb negative) organs and HBcAb negative patients who received HBcAb positive organs between January 2016 and December 2020 were reviewed. Pre-LT HBV serologies were collected. HBV-prophylaxis strategy included NA with/without HBIG. HBV recurrence was defined as HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) positivity during the 1-year, post-LT follow-up. No HBV surface antibody titers were followed. Results A total of 103 patients with a median age of 60 years participated in the study. Hepatitis C virus was the most common etiology. Thirty-seven HBcAb negative recipients and 11 HBcAb positive recipients with undetectable HBV DNA received HBcAb positive organs and underwent prophylaxis with 4 doses of low-dose HBIG and NA. None of the recipients in our cohort had a recurrence of HBV at 1 year. Conclusion Low-dose HBIG (1560 IU) \u00d7 4 days and NA, for HBcAb positive recipients and HBcAb positive donors, appear to be effective in preventing HBV reinfection during the post-LT period. Further trials are needed to confirm this observation.",
