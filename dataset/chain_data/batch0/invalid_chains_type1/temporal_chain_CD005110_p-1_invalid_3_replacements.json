        "title": "Gut-directed hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome: piloting a primary care-based randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn western populations irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects between 10% and 30% of the population and has a significant effect on quality of life. It generates a substantial workload in both primary and secondary care and has significant cost implications. Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life but has not been assessed outside of secondary and tertiary referral centres.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess the effectiveness of gut-directed hypnotherapy as a complementary therapy in the management of IBS.\n\n\nDESIGN OF STUDY\nRandomised controlled trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nPrimary care patients aged 18-65 years inclusive, with a diagnosis of IBS of greater than 6 weeks' duration and having failed conventional management, located in South Staffordshire and North Birmingham, UK.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIntervention patients received five sessions of hypnotherapy in addition to their usual management. Control patients received usual management alone. Data regarding symptoms and quality of life were collected at baseline and again 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomisation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups demonstrated a significant improvement in all symptom dimensions and quality of life over 12 months. At 3 months the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in pain, diarrhoea and overall symptom scores (P<0.05). No significant differences between groups in quality of life were identified. No differences were maintained over time. Intervention patients, however, were significantly less likely to require medication, and the majority described an improvement in their condition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGut-directed hypnotherapy benefits patients via symptom reduction and reduced medication usage, although the lack of significant difference between groups beyond 3 months prohibits its general introduction without additional evidence. A large trial incorporating robust economic analysis is, therefore, urgently recommended.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo review the evidence supporting selected complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n\nQUALITY OF EVIDENCE\nMEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Level I evidence was available for most interventions.\n\n\nMAIN MESSAGE\nSoluble fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain. Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSeveral complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nYoga is a popular form of complementary and alternative therapy. It is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Female sexual dysfunctions are common and do not always get adequate clinical attention. Pharmacotherapies for treating female sexual dysfunctions are available but suffer from drawbacks such as poor compliance, low efficacy, and side effects. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving sexual functions and treating sexual disorders.\n\n\nAIM\nTo establish the effect yoga can have on female sexual functions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 40 females (age range 22-55 years, average age 34.7 +/- 8.49 years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and were given a standardized questionnaire named Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) before and after the 12 weeks session of yoga.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nFSFI scores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIt was found that after the completion of yoga sessions; the sexual functions scores were significantly improved (P < 0.0001). The improvement occurred in all six domains of FSFI (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain). The improvement was more in older women (age > 45 years) compared with younger women (age < 45 years).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nYoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of sexual functions in women as studied by FSFI.",

        "title": "STRESS AND THE GUT: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES, DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH AND TREATMENT OPTIONS",
        "abstract": "Stress is a ubiquitous condition that affects all people. According to a definition given by H. Selye, stress is defined as an acute threat to the homeostasis of an organism. It may be real (physical) or perceived (psychological) and posed by events in the outside world or from within. Importantly, stress evokes adaptive responses that serve to defend the stability of the internal environment and to ensure the survival of the organism (1). The gastrointestinal tract and the immune system are particularly responsive to different stressors. In the past years the influence of psychosocial and environmental stressors on the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal diseases has received increased awareness (2). Stress may affect different physiologic functions of the gastrointestinal tract including gastric secretion, gut motility, mucosal permeability and barrier function, visceral sensitivity and mucosal blood flow (3-5) (Fig. 1). In recent years the important interplay between stress and gut microbiota has been shown. Interestingly, bacteria may respond directly to stress-related host signals. There is evidence that catecholamines can alter the growth, motility and virulence of pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Thereby, stress may influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts (6). This article reviews the impact of stress on the gastrointestinal tract. Especially the focus is addressed to the role of stress in the pathophysiology of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and to the diagnostic and therapeutic options to prevent stress-related disorders.

        "title": "Prokaryotes Versus Eukaryotes: Who is Hosting Whom?",
        "abstract": "Microorganisms represent the largest component of biodiversity in our world. For millions of years, prokaryotic microorganisms have functioned as a major selective force shaping eukaryotic evolution. Microbes that live inside and on animals outnumber the animals\u2019 actual somatic and germ cells by an estimated 10-fold. Collectively, the intestinal microbiome represents a \u201cforgotten organ,\u201d functioning as an organ inside another that can execute many physiological responsibilities. The nature of primitive eukaryotes was drastically changed due to the association with symbiotic prokaryotes facilitating mutual coevolution of host and microbe. Phytophagous insects have long been used to test theories of evolutionary diversification; moreover, the diversification of a number of phytophagous insect lineages has been linked to mutualisms with microbes. From termites and honey bees to ruminants and mammals, depending on novel biochemistries provided by the prokaryotic microbiome, the association helps to metabolize several nutrients that the host cannot digest and converting these into useful end products (such as short-chain fatty acids), a process, which has huge impact on the biology and homeostasis of metazoans. More importantly, in a direct and/or indirect way, the intestinal microbiota influences the assembly of gut-associated lymphoid tissue, helps to educate immune system, affects the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, modulates proliferation and differentiation of its epithelial lineages, regulates angiogenesis, and modifies the activity of enteric as well as the central nervous system. Despite these important effects, the mechanisms by which the gut microbial community influences the host\u2019s biology remain almost entirely unknown. Our aim here is to encourage empirical inquiry into the relationship between mutualism and evolutionary diversification between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which encourage us to postulate: who is hosting whom?",

        "abstract": "The emerging links between our gut microbiome and the central nervous system (CNS) are regarded as a paradigm shift in neuroscience with possible implications for not only understanding the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, but also their treatment. Thus the gut microbiome and its influence on host barrier function is positioned to be a critical node within the brain-gut axis. Mounting preclinical evidence broadly suggests that the gut microbiota can modulate brain development, function and behavior by immune, endocrine and neural pathways of the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Detailed mechanistic insights explaining these specific interactions are currently underdeveloped. However, the concept that a \u201cleaky gut\u201d may facilitate communication between the microbiota and these key signaling pathways has gained traction. Deficits in intestinal permeability may underpin the chronic low-grade inflammation observed in disorders such as depression and the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating intestinal permeability. In this review we will discuss the possible role played by the gut microbiota in maintaining intestinal barrier function and the CNS consequences when it becomes disrupted. We will draw on both clinical and preclinical evidence to support this concept as well as the key features of the gut microbiota which are necessary for normal intestinal barrier function.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing recognition of the importance of the commensal intestinal microbiota in the development and later function of the central nervous system. Research using germ-free mice (mice raised without any exposure to microorganisms) has provided some of the most persuasive evidence for a role of these bacteria in gut-brain signalling. Key findings show that the microbiota is necessary for normal stress responsivity, anxiety-like behaviors, sociability, and cognition. Furthermore, the microbiota maintains central nervous system homeostasis by regulating immune function and blood brain barrier integrity. Studies have also found that the gut microbiota influences neurotransmitter, synaptic, and neurotrophic signalling systems and neurogenesis. The principle advantage of the germ-free mouse model is in proof-of-principle studies and that a complete microbiota or defined consortiums of bacteria can be introduced at various developmental time points. However, a germ-free upbringing can induce permanent neurodevelopmental deficits that may deem the model unsuitable for specific scientific queries that do not involve early-life microbial deficiency. As such, alternatives and complementary strategies to the germ-free model are warranted and include antibiotic treatment to create microbiota-deficient animals at distinct time points across the lifespan. Increasing our understanding of the impact of the gut microbiota on brain and behavior has the potential to inform novel management strategies for stress-related gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "title": "Gut instincts: microbiota as a key regulator of brain development, ageing and neurodegeneration",
        "abstract": "There is a growing realisation that the gut\u2013brain axis and its regulation by the microbiota may play a key role in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopmental, age\u2010related and neurodegenerative disorders. The routes of communication between the microbiota and brain are being unravelled and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signalling, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism or by way of microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. The importance of early life gut microbiota in shaping future health outcomes is also emerging. Disturbances of this composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding, infection, stress and the environmental influences coupled with the influence of host genetics can result in long\u2010term effects on physiology and behaviour, at least in animal models. It is also worth noting that mode of delivery at birth influences microbiota composition with those born by Caesarean section having a distinctly different microbiota in early life to those born per vaginum. At the other extreme of life, ageing is associated with a narrowing in microbial diversity and healthy ageing correlates with a diverse microbiome. Recently, the gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of conditions including depression, autism, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. There is still considerable debate as to whether or not the gut microbiota changes are core to the pathophysiology of such conditions or are merely epiphenomenal. It is plausible that such neuropsychiatric disorders might be treated in the future by targeting the microbiota either by microbiota transplantation, antibiotics or psychobiotics.",

        "title": "Role of TLR4 in the gut-brain axis in Parkinson\u2019s disease: a translational study from men to mice",
        "abstract": "Objective Recent evidence suggesting an important role of gut-derived inflammation in brain disorders has opened up new directions to explore the possible role of the gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases. Given the prominence of dysbiosis and colonic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), we propose that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated intestinal dysfunction could contribute to intestinal and central inflammation in PD-related neurodegeneration. Design To test this hypothesis we performed studies in both human tissue and a murine model of PD. Inflammation, immune activation and microbiota composition were measured in colonic samples from subjects with PD and healthy controls subjects and rotenone or vehicle-treated mice. To further assess the role of the TLR4 signalling in PD-induced neuroinflammation, we used TLR4-knockout (KO) mice in conjunction with oral rotenone administration to model PD. Results Patients with PD have intestinal barrier disruption, enhanced markers of microbial translocation and higher pro-inflammatory gene profiles in the colonic biopsy samples compared with controls. In this regard, we found increased expression of the bacterial endotoxin-specific ligand TLR4, CD3+ T cells, cytokine expression in colonic biopsies, dysbiosis characterised by a decrease abundance of SCFA-producing colonic bacteria in subjects with PD. Rotenone treatment in TLR4-KO mice revealed less intestinal inflammation, intestinal and motor dysfunction, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, relative to rotenone-treated wild-type animals despite the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in TLR4-KO mice. Conclusion Taken together, these studies suggest that TLR4-mediated inflammation plays an important role in intestinal and/or brain inflammation, which may be one of the key factors leading to neurodegeneration in PD.",

        "abstract": "The gut microbiome acts as an integral part of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that has the largest and vulnerable surface with desirable features to observe foods, nutrients, and environmental factors, as well as to differentiate commensals, invading pathogens, and others. It is well-known that the gut has a strong connection with the central nervous system (CNS) in the context of health and disease. A healthy gut with diverse microbes is vital for normal brain functions and emotional behaviors. In addition, the CNS controls most aspects of the GI physiology. The molecular interaction between the gut/microbiome and CNS is complex and bidirectional, ensuring the maintenance of gut homeostasis and proper digestion. Besides this, several mechanisms have been proposed, including endocrine, neuronal, toll-like receptor, and metabolites-dependent pathways. Changes in the bidirectional relationship between the GIT and CNS are linked with the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal and neurological disorders; therefore, the microbiota/gut-and-brain axis is an emerging and widely accepted concept. In this review, we summarize the recent findings supporting the role of the gut microbiota and immune system on the maintenance of brain functions and the development of neurological disorders. In addition, we highlight the recent advances in improving of neurological diseases by probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation via the concept of the gut\u2013brain axis.",

        "abstract": "Background Altered gut microbiome (GM) composition has been established in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). However, few studies have longitudinally investigated the GM in PD, or the impact of device-assisted therapies. Objectives To investigate the temporal stability of GM profiles from PD patients on standard therapies and those initiating device-assisted therapies (DAT) and define multivariate models of disease and progression. Methods We evaluated validated clinical questionnaires and stool samples from 74 PD patients and 74 household controls (HCs) at 0, 6, and 12 months. Faster or slower disease progression was defined from levodopa equivalence dose and motor severity measures. 19 PD patients initiating Deep Brain Stimulation or Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel were separately evaluated at 0, 6, and 12 months post-therapy initiation. Results Persistent underrepresentation of short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria, Butyricicoccus, Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003, were apparent in PD patients relative to controls. A sustained effect of DAT initiation on GM associations with PD was not observed. PD progression analysis indicated that the genus Barnesiella was underrepresented in faster progressing PD patients at t = 0 and t = 12 months. Two-stage predictive modeling, integrating microbiota abundances and nutritional profiles, improved predictive capacity (change in Area Under the Curve from 0.58 to 0.64) when assessed at Amplicon Sequence Variant taxonomic resolution. Conclusion We present longitudinal GM studies in PD patients, showing persistently altered GM profiles suggestive of a reduced butyrogenic production potential. DATs exerted variable GM influences across the short and longer-term. We found that specific GM profiles combined with dietary factors improved prediction of disease progression in PD patients.",

        "abstract": "Gut microbiome-targeted interventions such as fecal transplant, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotic gut depletion are speculated to be of potential use in delaying the onset and progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease by rebalancing the gut microbiome in the context of the gut\u2013brain axis. Our study aims to organize recent findings regarding these interventions in Parkinson\u2019s disease animal models to identify how they affect neuroinflammation and motor outcomes. A systematic literature search was applied in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SCOPUS for gut microbiome-targeted non-dietary interventions. Studies that investigated gut-targeted interventions by using in vivo murine PD models to follow dopaminergic cell loss, motor tests, and neuroinflammatory markers as outcomes were considered to be eligible. A total of 1335 studies were identified in the databases, out of which 29 were found to be eligible. A narrative systematization of the resulting data was performed, and the effect direction for the outcomes was represented. Quality assessment using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool was also performed. Out of the 29 eligible studies, we found that a significant majority report that the intervention reduced the dopaminergic cell loss (82.76%, 95% CI [64.23%, 94.15%]) produced by the induction of the disease model. Also, most studies reported a reduction in microglial (87.5%, 95% CI [61.65%, 98.45%]) and astrocytic activation (84,62%, 95% CI [54.55%, 98.08%]) caused by the induction of the disease model. These results were also mirrored in the majority (96.4% 95% CI [81.65%, 99.91%]) of the studies reporting an increase in performance in behavioral motor tests. A significant limitation of the study was that insufficient information was found in the studies to assess specific causes of the risk of bias. These results show that non-dietary gut microbiome-targeted interventions can improve neuroinflammatory and motor outcomes in acute Parkinson\u2019s disease animal models. Further studies are needed to clarify if these benefits transfer to the long-term pathogenesis of the disease, which is not yet fully understood.
