        "abstract": "Elevated postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress increase the risks of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Green tea catechin possesses antidiabetic properties and antioxidant capacity. In the present study, we examined the acute and continuous effects of ingestion of catechin-rich green tea on postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in healthy postmenopausal women. Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3\u00a0h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0\u00a0h) and at 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3\u00a0% lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P<\u00a00\u00b705), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed. Conversely, serum postprandial thioredoxin concentrations were 5\u00a0% higher in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). These findings indicate that an acute ingestion of catechin-rich green tea has beneficial effects on postprandial glucose and redox homeostasis in postmenopausal women.",

        "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Soy and soy\u2010based foods are considered healthy, particularly in many Asia\u2013Pacific countries, where soy products have long been consumed. Soy and soy\u2010related products have been found to help prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. These products can also have antioxidative effects that alleviate hot flashes during menopause and bone loss. These biological and therapeutic functions are primarily due to the isoflavones derived from soy, whose structure is similar to the structure of 17\u2010\u03b2\u2010oestradiol. Despite the many health benefits for humans and animals, the application of isoflavones remains controversial because of their anti\u2010oestrogenic properties. We focused on general information regarding isoflavones, as well as their structure, function, and application. We summarized evidence showing that dietary or supplemental isoflavones exert protective effects on the health of humans and animals. Based on the literature, we conclude that soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe; however, more high\u2010quality trials are needed to fully substantiate their potential use.",

        "title": "Potential of phytochemicals in breast cancer prevention and therapy",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide among females (Bray et al., 2018). Breast cancer alone accounts for 30% of all new cancer diagnoses in women in the United States (Siegel, Miller, & Jemal, 2019), with 1,762,450 new cancer cases (and 606,880 cancer deaths) projected to occur in 2019 (Siegel et al., 2019). The situation is even worse in developing countries, which have limited healthcare resources and use different strategies to diagnose breast cancer (da Costa Vieira, Biller, Uemura, Ruiz, & Curado, 2017). Breast cancer patients seek for alternative therapies, mostly herbal remedies, as supportive care during cancer treatment, although the evidence of effectiveness is very limited (Greenlee et al. 2017). Moreover, phytochemicals are frequently examined for search of new bioactive molecules as well as potential adjuvants in conventional anticancer therapies with numerous examples in the recent literature in our Journal and elsewhere (Newman & Cragg, 2016; Thakur & Ahirwar, 2017; Tariq et al., 2017; Liao, Apaya, & Shyur, 2013; Bae et al., 2017; Lin, Gong, Song, & Cui, 2017; Pagano, Romano, Izzo, & Borrelli, 2018; Marian, 2017; Lukong, Ogunbolude, & Kamdem, 2017 Salehi et al., 2018; Erices, Torres, Niechi, Bernales, & Quezada, 2018; Hsiao, Lin, Wang, Hsin, & Yang, 2019). This PTR Virtual Issue\u2014freely available at https://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/journal/10991573\u2014focuses on the experimental and clinical pharmacology of plant\u2010derived compounds in breast cancer. The issue includes three review articles, one clinical trial, and 19 experimental studies. The published review articles highlight the potential of green tea and phytoestrogens in breast cancer prevention (Anandhi Senthilkumar, Fata, & Kennelly, 2018; Najaf Najafi, Salehi, Ghazanfarpour, Hoseini, & Khadem\u2010Rezaiyan, 2018; Xiao, Zhang, Tong, & Shi, 2018). Similarly, there is evidence in the literature that the consumption of both green tea and phytoestrogens\u2010containing vegetables could be correlated with a low incidence of other chronic pathologies, such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Peluso & Serafini, 2017; Andrew & Izzo, 2017; Rietjens, Louisse, & Beekmann, 2017; Bedrood, Rameshrad, & Hosseinzadeh, 2018;).

        "abstract": "Revision operations have become a new issue after successful artificial joint replacements, and periprosthetic osteolysis leading to prosthetic loosening is the main cause of why the overactivation of osteoclasts (OCs) plays an important role. The effect of biochanin A (BCA) has been examined in osteoporosis, but no study on the role of BCA in prosthetic loosening osteolysis has been conducted yet. In this study, we utilised enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, computed tomography imaging, and histological analysis. Results showed that BCA downregulated the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), and IL\u20101\u03b2 to suppress inflammatory responses. The secretion levels of receptor\u2010activated nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB ligand, CTX\u20101, and osteoclast\u2010associated receptor as well as Ti\u2010induced osteolysis were also reduced. BCA effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed hydroxyapatite resorption by downregulating OC\u2010related genes in vitro. Analysis of mechanisms indicated that BCA inhibited the signalling pathways of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (P38, extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase, and c\u2010JUN N\u2010terminal kinase) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (inhibitor \u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and P65), thereby downregulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 and c\u2010Fos. In conclusion, BCA may be an alternative choice for the prevention of prosthetic loosening caused by OCs.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis (OP) has severely affected human health, which is characterized by abnormal differentiation of osteoclasts. Urolithin B (UB), as a potential natural drug, has been reported to exhibit numerous biological activities including antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory but its effects on OP, especially on RANKL\u2010stimulated osteoclast formation and activation, are still understood. In our study, we have demonstrated for the first time that UB inhibits RANKL\u2010induced osteoclast differentiation and explored its potential mechanisms of action. The RAW264.7 cells were cultured and induced with RANKL followed by UB treatment. Then, the effects of UB on mature osteoclast differentiation were evaluated by counting tartrate\u2010resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)\u2010positive multinucleated cells and F\u2010actin ring analysis. Moreover, the effects of UB on RANKL\u2010induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by 2\u2032, 7\u2032\u2010dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH\u2010DA) staining. Further, we explored the potential mechanisms of these downregulation effects by performing Western blotting and quantitative RT\u2010PCR examination. We found that UB represses osteoclastogenesis, F\u2010actin belts formation, osteoclast\u2010specific gene expressions and ROS activity in a time\u2010 and concentration\u2010dependent manner. Mechanistically, UB attenuates intracellular ROS levels by upregulation of Nrf2 and other ROS scavenging enzymes activation. Furthermore, UB also inhibited RANKL\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPK and Akt signalling pathway and suppressed expression of c\u2010Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1), which is the master transcription factor of osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our findings confirm that UB is a polyphenolic compound that can be a potential therapeutic treatment for osteoclast\u2010related bone diseases such as osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "Periodontal disease and arthroplasty prosthesis loosening and destabilization are both associated with osteolysis, which is predominantly caused by abnormal bone resorption triggered by pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Osteoclasts (OCs) are critical players in the process. Concerns regarding the long\u2010term efficacy and side effects of current frontline therapies, however, remain. Alternative therapies are still required. The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of Tenacissoside H (TDH) in RANKL\u2010mediated OC differentiation, as well as inflammatory osteolysis and associated processes. In vitro, bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (BMMs) cultured with RANKL and M\u2010CSF were used to detect TDH in the differentiation and function of OCs. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of specific genes and inflammatory factors in OCs. Western blot was used to identify NFATc1, IKK, NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPK pathway, and oxidative stress\u2010related components. Finally, an LPS\u2010mediated calvarial osteolysis mouse model was employed to explore TDH's role in inflammatory osteolysis. The results showed that in vivo TDH inhibited the differentiation and resorption functions of OCs and down\u2010regulated the transcription of osteoclast\u2010specific genes, as well as Il\u20101\u03b2, Il\u20106 and Tnf\u2010\u03b1. In addition, TDH inhibited the IKK and NF\u2010\u03baB signalling pathways and down\u2010regulated the level of ROS. In vivo studies revealed that TDH improves the bone loss caused by LPS. TDH may be a new candidate or treatment for osteoclast\u2010associated inflammatory osteolytic disease.",
