        "abstract": "Objectives.The objective of this work was to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of a brief behavioral dietary intervention and 2 supplemental components of diabetes self-management support: telephone follow-up calls and community resources enhancement. Design and Subjects.This was a 2 \u00d7 2 randomized, controlled trial investigating the incremental effects of telephone follow-up and community resources enhancement with 320 adult type 2 diabetes outpatients. Methods.Key outcomes included behavioral (dietary patterns, fat intake), physiologic (HbA1C, lipids), and quality-of-life/patient satisfaction measures and were collected at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results.Despite high reach (76% patient participation), excellent adoption (all 12 primary care practices approached participated), and good implementation, there were few outcome differences among treatment conditions. There was significant improvement across conditions in most outcomes in each category at both follow-ups. Conclusions.A brief, computer-assisted, dietary goal\u2013setting intervention basic treatment condition was moderately successful in producing dietary improvements but less so in producing biologic or quality-of-life outcomes. Additions of follow-up phone calls or a community resources enhancement component did not produce incremental improvements over this basic intervention.",

        "abstract": "Whole grains are important dietary constituents as they provide a plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals that may have synergistic actions in promoting health. Regular consumption of wholegrain foods has been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases such as CHD and certain cancers, although their exact role in disease prevention is not yet fully elucidated. Studies reporting levels of whole grain consumption reveal that those subjects who include higher levels of whole grain foods in their diets also have many other favourable dietary and lifestyle practices. While the actions of these practices and whole grains may not be mutually exclusive, these variables do not appear to explain the reduction in risk of disease observed for high-whole grain consumers. Actual whole grain consumption levels are extremely low and many practical barriers exist to consumer uptake of these foods. Effective communication of the whole grain health message is an important strategy to increase awareness of the importance of whole grains in the diet. Increasing the variety and availability of acceptable wholegrain foods is also important. Whole grain consumption at breakfast can have an important impact on total daily nutrient intakes. This simple dietary modification is potentially relatively easy to achieve and could greatly contribute to increased whole grain intake for many individuals.",

        "abstract": "Whole-grain rye and wheat products are rich in lignans, the precursors of enterolactone (ENL) and alkylresorcinols (ARs), which are phenolic lipids. In this crossover trial, we examined the effect of whole-grain rye bread compared with low-fiber wheat bread on plasma AR levels. Women (n = 39) aged 59 +/- 0.94 y (mean +/- SEM) were advised to consume rye (214 +/- 7.1 g/d) or wheat (178 +/- 6.5 g/d) bread (20% of total daily energy intake) in random order for 8 wk. The test periods were separated by an 8-wk washout period. ARs with different homologues and ENL were measured in plasma collected at the beginning (habitual diet) and end of the test bread periods. AR concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) after the rye bread (352 +/- 24.7 nmol/L) and habitual diet (97.7 +/- 12.1 and 88.3 +/- 8.7 nmol/L) periods than after the wheat bread period (36.6 +/- 4.2 nmol/L). Plasma AR concentrations were correlated with intake of rye bread (r = 0.34, P = 0.037), and with insoluble fiber from the whole diet during the rye (r = 0.39, P = 0.013) and wheat (r = 0.32, P = 0.047) bread periods. The plasma AR 17:0/21:0 ratio differed after the rye (0.84 +/- 0.04) and wheat (0.53 +/- 0.08) bread diet periods (P < 0.001). These data strongly suggest that plasma ARs could be used as specific biomarkers for whole-grain rye intake, and their homologue pattern could be used as an indicator of the bread type consumed.",

        "abstract": "Alkylresorcinols with alkyl chains C17:0-C25:0 are abundant in whole-grain wheat and rye. Concentrations in human plasma have been suggested to be biomarkers of dietary whole-grain intake. We measured human plasma, erythrocyte, and lipoprotein alkylresorcinol concentrations and alkylresorcinol homolog distribution, and evaluated the use of plasma alkylresorcinol concentration as a dietary biomarker of whole-grain intake compared with serum enterolactone. A total of 15 subjects (8 women) consumed whole-grain wheat or whole-grain rye crisp bread ( approximately 100 g/d) in a crossover design for 1 wk. The test bread periods were preceded by 1-wk periods of consuming refined wheat bread. Plasma, erythrocyte, lipoprotein alkylresorcinol, and serum enterolactone concentrations were measured before and after each period, and plasma alkylresorcinols and serum enterolactone were measured after habitual diet intake before and 1 wk after the trial. Plasma alkylresorcinols are transported in lipoproteins with VLDL and HDL being the main carriers. AR concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, and lipoproteins were increased (P < 0.05) by whole-grain wheat bread and even more so with rye crisp bread, although interindividual variation was high. The alkylresorcinol homolog C17:0 to C21:0 ratio in plasma was higher after the whole-grain rye diet period compared with the whole-grain wheat diet period (P < 0.05). Serum enterolactone concentrations were increased significantly by whole-grain rye intake only in men. This is the first report to show that alkylresorcinols in human plasma are mainly transported in lipoproteins. The plasma alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 ratio reflects intake of whole-grain wheat and rye, and the plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration appears to be a useful biomarker of whole-grain cereal intake.",

The pigs were fed high-fat, high-cholesterol rye- (n = 9) or wheat- (n = 8) based buns with similar levels of dietary fiber for 9-10 wk. Fasting plasma samples were collected 2 days before and after 8 and 12 days on the experimental diets, while postprandial samples taken after 58-67 days, and( 1)H NMR spectra were acquired on these. Principal component analysis on the obtained NMR spectra demonstrated clear effects of diet on the plasma metabolite profile, and partial least squares regression discriminant analysis on the spectra revealed that the intensity of the spectral region at 3.29 ppm dominated the differentiation between the two diets, as the rye diet was associated with higher spectral intensity in this region. The 3.29 ppm signal is ascribed to N(CH(3))(3) protons in betaine, which may be an important contributor to the health promoting effects of rye.",

        "abstract": "Alkylresorcinols (ARs) were first proposed as potential biomarkers of wholegrain wheat and rye intake a decade ago. Since then there has been a considerable body of research which suggests that ARs do meet most criteria of a biomarker of these foods. Results from human studies on plasma AR and their plasma and urinary metabolites strongly indicate that these compounds are responsive to whole grain wheat and rye intake and are correlated with various measures of AR consumption. This review briefly summarises work on the bioactivities of AR and focuses on aspects related to their use as biomarkers of whole grain wheat and rye intake. Evidence suggests that they thus far broadly fulfil the criteria to act as biomarkers of these cereals. However, there are still gaps in the knowledge on factors relating to the wide interindividual variation, and application to different epidemiological cohorts. Overall, ARs are highly promising biomarkers of whole grain wheat and rye intake and add to our increasing understanding of whole grains and health.",

        "abstract": "Background: In order to attenuate the measurement error inherent in dietary recall methods, alkylresorcinols (ARs) have been proposed as a biomarker of whole-grain (WG) intake (1, 2). Although ARs have shown promise in experimental (3) and observational studies (4), most of this research has been conducted in Nordic populations that consume relatively high amounts of WG (5). Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess the utility of plasma AR concentration as a WG intake biomarker and identify the primary dietary and nondietary determinants of plasma AR concentration in a population that consumes relatively few WG. Methods: This ancillary study used data from first-year college students (n=122) who completed three interviewer-administered 24-hour recalls and had two fasting venous blood draws performed on non-consecutive days. Dietary data was compiled using the Nutrition Data System for Research (6). Blood lipids and glucose were determined via enzymatic assay and plasma AR concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7). Correlation coefficients (rs) were calculated between plasma AR concentrations and dietary intake variables and cardiometabolic risk factors. One-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test were used to assess group differences across plasma AR quartiles. Determinants of plasma AR concentration were assessed using multiple regression models. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.2.3. Results: Plasma AR concentration was significantly positively correlated with WG intake (rs = 0.24, p <0.01). The correlation was stronger in males (n=36, rs = 0.33, p < 0.05) than females (n=86, rs = 0.18, p = 0.08). One-way ANOVA across plasma AR quartiles was significant for fiber intake [F(3,118) = 8.58, p < 0.001] and Tukey\u2019s HSD test showed that the mean daily fiber intake for the highest AR quartile was significantly greater than for the lowest (M = 20.2 \u00b1 1.9 g, 14.7 \u00b1 1.4 g respectively). The only cardiometabolic risk factor that was significantly associated with plasma AR concentration was triglycerides (rs = 0.27, p < 0.01). Multiple regression models including log-transformed dietary variables showed that WG bread was the only significant food-item predictor of plasma AR concentration (\u03b2 = 0.54, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Although plasma AR concentration was significantly associated with WG and fiber intake, triglycerides were the primary determinant and the relationships were not strong enough to produce accurate WG intake prediction models. More research is needed on the use of AR as a quantitative biomarker in low WGconsuming populations.",
