        "title": "Combining infliximab with methotrexate for the induction and maintenance of remission in refractory Crohn's disease: a controlled pilot study",
        "abstract": "Objectives Immunosuppression of chronic active Crohn's disease resistant or intolerant to purine antimetabolites still remains a clinical challenge. To obtain long-lasting effects with the anti-TNF-&agr; antibody infliximab repeated infusions are often required. Methotrexate has been shown to be a moderately effective drug in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the combination of infliximab and methotrexate as therapy for refractory Crohn's disease. Methods Nineteen patients with chronic active Crohn's disease resistant or intolerant to azathioprine were enrolled. Patients received either two infusions of infliximab (5\u2009mg/kg) alone (n=8) or in combination with long-term methotrexate at a dosage of 20\u2009mg/week (n=11) over 48 weeks. Results Two out of eight patients receiving infliximab monotherapy and four out of 11 patients treated with infliximab and concomitant methotrexate had discontinued study treatment by week 48, solely because of lack of efficacy. Clinical remission at week 48 was observed in five out of seven patients treated with infliximab and methotrexate, but only in two out of six patients receiving infliximab monotherapy. In addition, patients treated with concomitant methotrexate achieved remission earlier (median time 2 versus 18 weeks) and needed fewer steroids (median prednisolone dose 0 versus 11.8\u2009mg). Despite an increased mean number of adverse events per patient in the methotrexate group, the proportions of patients experiencing any adverse events and serious adverse events were similar across treatment groups. Conclusions The combination of infliximab with long-term methotrexate may be a promising concept in refractory Crohn's disease. Our data prompt larger trials.",

        "title": "Methotrexate Treatment in Pediatric Crohn Disease Patients Intolerant or Resistant to Purine Analogues",
        "abstract": "Background: Immunomodulatory drugs play a major role in maintaining remission and steroid sparing in children with Crohn disease. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, unresponsiveness or intolerance to these drugs is common. The efficacy of methotrexate in maintenance of remission has been shown in adult Crohn disease; however, pediatric data are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in induction and maintenance of clinical remission in children with active Crohn disease who failed thiopurine treatment. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective multicenter study, efficacy of methotrexate in inducing and maintaining remission or response was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, paediatric Crohn disease activity index and steroid use, in 25 children with Crohn disease, refractory or intolerant to thiopurine analogues. Results: Crohn disease was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 \u00b1 3.1 years and methotrexate was initiated at age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1 years. The median methotrexate dose was 12.5 mg/m2. Remission was achieved in 16 patients (64%), and response in 6 patients (24%). Out of 18 patients treated for longer than 6 months, 83% were in remission or response after 12 months of treatment. The mean duration of remission and response was 10.8 \u00b1 8.8 months. Steroid withdrawal was possible in 12/16 patients (75%) receiving steroids at methotrexate introduction. Adverse effects were observed in 6 patients (24%) including nausea and vomiting in 3, elevation of liver enzymes in 2 and pancreatitis in 1 patient. Conclusions: Methotrexate is beneficial in maintaining remission and steroid-sparing treatment in children with Crohn disease following failure of thiopurine therapy.",

        "title": "Short-course Ondansetron for the Prevention of Methotrexate-induced Nausea in Children With Crohn Disease",
        "abstract": "Objectives: Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for Crohn disease (CD); however, its application may be limited by the occurrence of nausea. We assessed whether a short course of ondansetron minimized this adverse event. Patients and Methods: A retrospective case-control study of patients with CD who received MTX at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario between 2001 and 2009 was conducted. Results: Sixty-four patients received MTX during this time period. The mean age of diagnosis was 12.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.0 years (\u00b1 standard deviation), and the mean age when MTX was initiated was 13.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.6 years. Those receiving only 1 or 2 doses of MTX (N\u200a=\u200a4) and stopped for reasons other than development of nausea were not included in the analysis. Fifty patients received ondansetron premedication using a 4- to 8-week tapering schedule with MTX, and only 1 patient (2.0%) developed nausea within the first 3 months of MTX. In contrast, 6 of 10 patients (60.0%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) not premedicated with ondansetron reported nausea following MTX within 3 months. Four of these 6 patients subsequently received ondansetron and had no further complaints. Following ondansetron discontinuation, 5 of 50 (10%) patients developed nausea with subsequent MTX injections, but responded to reinstitution of ondansetron. Some children developed anticipatory nausea (6/60, 10%) and 3 experienced nausea relief after initiating premedication with ondansetron. Conclusions: Nausea following MTX is a common complaint in patients with CD. For most, this adverse effect may be prevented through the use of a short-course ondansetron as premedication. Ondansetron to treat MTX-induced nausea also can be successfully used but a proactive preventive strategy can be achieved.",

        "title": "Prevalence and Risk Factors for Symptoms of Methotrexate Intolerance in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease",
        "abstract": "Background: Methotrexate (MTX) intolerance is defined as gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms occurring before or after MTX administration that may lead to treatment discontinuation. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of MTX intolerance in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score developed in rheumatology and to identify risk factors for MTX intolerance. Methods: Patients with pediatric IBD followed in the IBD clinic of Sainte Justine Hospital who had received MTX for IBD between 2004 and 2016 and were still actively on MTX were invited to fill out the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire. A cutoff score of \u22656 points was used to define MTX intolerance, with at least one point for anticipatory, associative or behavioral items. Results: Among 102 pediatric patients with IBD, 32 (31%) patients reported symptoms of MTX intolerance. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, factors that were associated with having symptoms of MTX intolerance were female sex (odds ratio 4.31 [95% confidence interval, 1.37\u201313.60], P = 0.01), receiving a dose of MTX higher than 20 mg/wk at the time of the questionnaire (odds ratio 4.06 [95% confidence interval, 1.30\u201312.70], P = 0.02), and having active disease according to Physician's Global Assessment (odds ratio 3.44 [95% confidence interval, 1.15\u201310.26], P = 0.03). Prophylactic prescription of antiemetics and folic acid did not prevent symptoms of MTX intolerance. Conclusions: Symptoms of MTX intolerance are frequent in pediatric IBD. The Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire could help better recognition of these symptoms. Identification of risk factors could have important implications for the success of treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nWe aim to provide guidance for medical treatment of luminal Crohn's disease in children.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic search of publication databases to identify studies of medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on them.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe consensus includes 25 statements focused on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of oral 5-aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the role of aminosalicylates in treatment of patients with mild disease, antibiotics or vedolizumab for induction or maintenance therapy, or methotrexate for induction therapy. Patients in clinical remission who are receiving immunomodulators should be assessed for mucosal healing within 1 year of treatment initiation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEvidence-based medical treatment of Crohn's disease in children is recommended, with thorough ongoing assessments to define treatment success.",

        "title": "Pulmonary Crohn\u2019s Disease or Crohn\u2019s Disease with Lung Sarcoidosis? A Case Report and Literature Review",
        "abstract": "Background: Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative hemorrhagic colitis are forms of granulomatous inflammatory intestinal disease, which usually affects the gastrointestinal tract. There are also reported rare localizations at the skin, kidney, joints, liver and eye level. Pulmonary involvement is relatively rare, and it is most commonly reported in suppuration with bronchiectasis. On the other hand, sarcoidosis is, in principle, a thoracic localization of a granulomatosis disease, although bowel, skin and intestinal disorders are described. There is not a clear line to separate Crohn\u2019s disease from sarcoidosis with, possibly because they are, in fact, considered to have the same inflammatory granulomatosis disease pathology. The diagnoses of the two entities, sarcoidosis and Crohn\u2019s disease, are based on non-pathognomonic, inclusive clinical and paraclinical criteria, without elements of the mutual exclusion of typical locations. Case Report: We present a very rare case of a young male, already diagnosed with small-bowel Crohn\u2019s disease. Granulomatous lung disease with major hemoptysis requires emergency surgery. An intraoperative assessment revealed a necrotic hemorrhagic lesion located in the left lower lobe and a lobectomy was performed. The final pathological report showed the presence of non-caseous granulomatous inflammation, with the identification of specific multinucleated giant cells. Conclusions: The identical diagnostic principles of Crohn\u2019s disease and sarcoidosis, Crohn\u2019s disease as a predecessor to pulmonary lesions, the clinical picture and the necrotico-hemorrhagic appearance of the unilateral pulmonary lesion, which are similar to aggressive necrotico-hemorrhagic or perforating intestinal forms, are arguments in favor of the diagnosis of pulmonary Crohn\u2019s disease and not pulmonary sarcoidosis. At the same time, in general, the two diseases have overlapping elements, suggesting they are, in fact, not the same disease with different facets.",

TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab) are preferentially used. Recent studies suggest that early application of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors is beneficial to inducing disease remission and preventing complications such as development of penetrating ulcers and fistulas. However, treatment failure occurs in about one third of pediatric patients. Particularly, children and adolescents differ in drug clearance, emphasizing the importance of pharmacokinetic drug monitoring in the pediatric setting.
