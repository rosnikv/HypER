This study aimed to assess whether route of delivery and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of the participants may also affect the outcome of BMSC treatment in patients with AMI and ischaemic heart disease (IHD).",

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, many investigators have utilized bone marrow\u2010derived cells for cell transplantation therapy in animal studies and in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. In those experimental and clinical studies, various doses and types of bone marrow\u2010derived cells have been transplanted to the injured myocardium using a variety of approaches, such as intracoronary infusion or catheter\u2010based direct endomyocardial injection, and at different time points after successful coronary reperfusion. The reported treatment effects are variable, which may be related to differences in cell type and quantity of transplanted cells, timing and approach of cell transplantation and patient selection. In this review, we summarize and discuss the controversies and questions related to the clinical use of bone marrow\u2010derived cells.",

        "title": "Challenges for heart disease stem cell therapy",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. The use of stem cells to improve recovery of the injured heart after myocardial infarction (MI) is an important emerging therapeutic strategy. However, recent reviews of clinical trials of stem cell therapy for MI and ischemic heart disease recovery report that less than half of the trials found only small improvements in cardiac function. In clinical trials, bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood cells were used as the source of stem cells delivered by intracoronary infusion. Some trials administered only a stem cell mobilizing agent that recruits endogenous sources of stem cells. Important challenges to improve the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for CVD include: (1) improved identification, recruitment, and expansion of autologous stem cells; (2) identification of mobilizing and homing agents that increase recruitment; and (3) development of strategies to improve stem cell survival and engraftment of both endogenous and exogenous sources of stem cells. This review is an overview of stem cell therapy for CVD and discusses the challenges these three areas present for maximum optimization of the efficacy of stem cell therapy for heart disease, and new strategies in progress.",

        "abstract": "In June 2013, Canadian Blood Services (CBS) established the National Public Cord Blood Bank (NPCBB) accessible to Canadian and international patients and researchers. The NPCBB promotes efforts that contribute to research and improved clinical care by making units not suitable for banking or transplantation available for research. In the context of the NPCBB of the CBS, this article will focus on the practical tools (e.g., consent protocols) developed to optimize umbilical cord blood (UCB) banking and research while enabling ethical provenance of UCB stem cells. The Canadian approach represents an ideal model for comparison as it is a country in which the national public bank (and other regional/provincial public banks) coexists with private companies.",
