Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy.

        "abstract": "Although autoreactive T cells are thought to play a prominent role in autoimmune disease in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, it has been difficult to directly determine if autoreactive T cells escape from the thymus and react with self-antigens in the periphery. Defective expression of the Fas apoptosis antigen in MRL-lpr/lpr mice results from the insertion of the ETn retrotransposon. The fas defect can be partially corrected in CD2-fas transgenic mice in which the expression of fas is corrected in T cells. To identify a possible defect in clonal deletion or clonal anergy induction of auto-specific T cells, we have studied C57BL/6-lpr/lpr transgenic mice that express TcR genes that recognize a known self-antigen, the male H-Y antigen. In addition, we have analyzed clonal deletion and tolerance induction after neonatal tolerance induction and superantigen-induced arthritis with the class II MHC reactive superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in V beta 8 TcR transgenic and non-transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Neonatal tolerance induction to SEB was normal in lpr/lpr mice. However, over time a loss of tolerance (thymic or peripheral) was observed in lpr/lpr mice but not in +/+ TcR transgenic mice. This defect in lpr/lpr mice was thymic-dependent and was due to increased CD28/CTLA4 signaling. These results suggest that an apoptosis defect involving both thymocytes and peripheral lymphoid cells leads to autoimmune disease in lpr/lpr mice. The challenge in the future will be to determine the role of defective apoptosis in other autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Superantigens (SAgs) have the capacity of stimulating T cells polyclonally. The only requirement for T cells to respond is the expression of particular T-cell receptor (TCR) VP elements (Fleischer & Schrezemeier 1988, MacDonald et al. 1988, White et al. 1989). Any SAg can, therefore, stimulate between 1% and 40% ofthe total T-cell repertoire, with a wide range of peptide specificities. SAgs have the capacity of binding tightly to MHC class II molecules and are, because of the restricted distribution of these molecules, presented mostly by classical antigenpresenting cells (Held et al. 1994, MacDonald et al. 1993). They are produced by bacteria {Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia and Mycoplasma) as exotoxins, by viruses (rabies and cytomegalovirus) as components of the viral particle and by retroviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV) where they are produced after integration of the reverse transcribed genome into the host DNA (AchaOrbea & MacDonald, 1995). Autoreactivity in the absence of autoimmunity is more the rule than the exception. Autoreactive T and B cells can be easily isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals (He et al. 1993, Hohlfeld et al. 1984, Wucherpfennig et al. 1991). In experimental animals, autoimmunity can be induced by injection of autoantigens or can occur spontaneously in certain strains (see below). The discovery of SAgs immediately raised attractive models for the induction of autoimmunity, since the polyclonal activation of T and B cells by SAgs does not distinguish between autoimmune and normal lymphocytes. This activation might break the delicate balance of tolerance. After SAg encounter, a polyclonal activation of T cells occurs, which is usually",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) persists inside macrophages despite vigorous immune responses. MTB and MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibit class II MHC (MHC-II) expression and Ag processing by a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent mechanism that is shown in this study to involve a defect in IFN-\u03b3 induction of class II transactivator (CIITA). Exposure of macrophages to MTB or MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced MHC-II expression, but not IL-4-induced MHC-II expression, by preventing induction of mRNA for CIITA (total, type I, and type IV), IFN regulatory factor-1, and MHC-II.

MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit translocation of phosphorylated Stat1 to the nucleus or Stat1 binding to and transactivation of IFN-\u03b3-sensitive promoter constructs. Thus, MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3 signaling independent of SOCS1 and without interfering with the activation of Stat1.

        "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

        "abstract": "Down-regulation of the KAI1 (CD82) metastasis suppressor is common in advanced human cancer, but underlying mechanism(s) regulating KAI1 expression are only now being elucidated. Recent data provide evidence that low levels of KAI1 mRNA in LNCaP cells are caused by binding of \u03b2-catenin/Reptin complexes to a specific motif in the proximal promoter, which prevents binding of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to the same motif, thus inhibiting transcription. Here, we explored a pathway by which phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) up-regulates KAI1 transcriptionin LNCaPprostate cancercells. Pretreatment with specific inhibitors showedthat induction of KAI1by PMA uses classic isoforms of protein kinase C (cPKC), is independent of Ras and Raf, and requires activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but does not involve p38MAPK. Induction of KAI1 transcription by PMA was associated with enhanced overall acetylation of histones H3 and H4, but only acetylation of H3 was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that PMA induces recruitment of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to NF\u03baB-p50 motifs in the proximal promoter, and this was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. These changes were not associated with differences in overall levels of Tip60, Pontin, \u03b2-catenin, or Reptin protein expression but with PMA-induced nuclear translocation of Tip60.",

        "abstract": "Initiation of an adaptive cellular immune response depends on intimate interactions with APCs and naive T lymphocytes. We previously reported that activation of naive Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells depends on dendritic cell (DC) transport of live bacteria from the lungs to the mediastinal lymph node (MDLN). Because the migratory paths of DCs are largely governed by the chemokine receptor CCR7, which is expressed on DCs upon maturation by proinflammatory stimuli, we examined the quantitative contribution of CCR7-dependent DC migration in the context of tuberculosis. We found that early trafficking of DCs from the lungs to the MDLN depended on CCR7-mediated signaling, but alternative mechanism(s) are used later in infection. Impaired migration of DCs in CCR7\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in delayed dissemination of bacteria to MDLN and spleen and in delayed kinetics of activation of adoptively transferred Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to control mice, we found that naive Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells are activated to proliferate in the lungs of CCR7\u2212/\u2212 mice and, when infected with higher doses of bacteria, resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in CCR7\u2212/\u2212 mice is compromised compared with wild-type mice.",

        "abstract": "Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node and requires transport of M. tuberculosis by migratory dendritic cells (DCs) to the local lymph node. The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

        "title": "Rapid Sequestration of Leishmania mexicana by Neutrophils Contributes to the Development of Chronic Lesion",
        "abstract": "The protozoan Leishmania mexicana parasite causes chronic non-healing cutaneous lesions in humans and mice with poor parasite control. The mechanisms preventing the development of a protective immune response against this parasite are unclear. Here we provide data demonstrating that parasite sequestration by neutrophils is responsible for disease progression in mice. Within hours of infection L. mexicana induced the local recruitment of neutrophils, which ingested parasites and formed extracellular traps without markedly impairing parasite survival. We further showed that the L. mexicana-induced recruitment of neutrophils impaired the early recruitment of dendritic cells at the site of infection as observed by intravital 2-photon microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Indeed, infection of neutropenic Genista mice and of mice depleted of neutrophils at the onset of infection demonstrated a prominent role for neutrophils in this process. Furthermore, an increase in monocyte-derived dendritic cells was also observed in draining lymph nodes of neutropenic mice, correlating with subsequent increased frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting T helper cells, and better parasite control leading ultimately to complete healing of the lesion. Altogether, these findings show that L. mexicana exploits neutrophils to block the induction of a protective immune response and impairs the control of lesion development. Our data thus demonstrate an unanticipated negative role for these innate immune cells in host defense, suggesting that in certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis, regulating neutrophil recruitment could be a strategy to promote lesion healing.",

        "title": "Twin Attributes of Tyrosyl-tRNA Synthetase of Leishmania donovani",
        "abstract": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are housekeeping enzymes essential for protein synthesis. Apart from their parent aminoacylation activity, several aaRSs perform non-canonical functions in diverse biological processes. The present study explores the twin attributes of Leishmania tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (LdTyrRS) namely, aminoacylation, and as a mimic of host CXC chemokine. Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite. Its genome encodes a single copy of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. We first tested the canonical aminoacylation role of LdTyrRS. The recombinant protein was expressed, and its kinetic parameters were determined by aminoacylation assay. To study the physiological role of LdTyrRS in Leishmania, gene deletion mutations were attempted via targeted gene replacement. The heterozygous mutants showed slower growth kinetics and exhibited attenuated virulence. LdTyrRS appears to be an essential gene as the chromosomal null mutants did not survive. Our data also highlights the non-canonical function of L. donovani tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. We show that LdTyrRS protein is present in the cytoplasm and exits from the parasite cytoplasm into the extracellular medium. The released LdTyrRS functions as a neutrophil chemoattractant. We further show that LdTyrRS specifically binds to host macrophages with its ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg) peptide motif. The ELR-CXCR2 receptor interaction mediates this binding. This interaction triggers enhanced secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by host macrophages. Our data indicates a possible immunomodulating role of LdTyrRS in Leishmania infection. This study provides a platform to explore LdTyrRS as a potential target for drug development",

Current treatments using anti-parasitic drugs are toxic and prolonged with poor patient compliance. In addition, emergence of drug-resistant parasites is increasing worldwide. Hence, there is a need for safer and better therapeutics for these infections. Host-directed therapy using drugs that target host pathways required for pathogen survival or its clearance is a promising approach for treating infections.

        "abstract": "IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interaction with eosinophils maintains dermis-resident macrophages as replicative niches for Leishmania major. Tight tissue associations The intracellular pathogen Leishmania major has been found to replicate in dermal tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) that have an M2-like phenotype, but L. major also promotes a strong TH1 immune environment. Here, Lee et al. show that dermal TRMs can maintain an M2 phenotype in this TH1 environment through IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interactions with eosinophils. Eosinophils were identified as the main source of IL-4 that drove local proliferation of dermal TRMs with M2 properties. IL-4 and IL-10 stimulation of dermal TRMs triggered production of CCL24, which promoted further eosinophil recruitment and close interactions with TRMs. These observations provide insight into this intercellular interaction that may have relevance to other inflammatory conditions. Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) maintain tissue homeostasis, but they can also provide a replicative niche for intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. How dermal TRMs proliferate and maintain their M2 properties even in the strong TH1 environment of the L. major infected dermis is not clear. Here, we show that, in infected mice lacking IL-4/13 from eosinophils, dermal TRMs shifted to a proinflammatory state, their numbers declined, and disease was attenuated. Intravital microscopy revealed a rapid infiltration of eosinophils followed by their tight interaction with dermal TRMs. IL-4\u2013stimulated dermal TRMs, in concert with IL-10, produced a large amount of CCL24, which functioned to amplify eosinophil influx and their interaction with dermal TRMs. An intraperitoneal helminth infection model also demonstrated a requirement for eosinophil-derived IL-4 to maintain tissue macrophages through a CCL24-mediated amplification loop. CCL24 secretion was confined to resident macrophages in other tissues, implicating eosinophil-TRM cooperative interactions in diverse inflammatory settings.",

        "abstract": "The term \u2018macrophage\u2019 encompasses tissue cells that typically share dependence on the same transcriptional regulatory pathways (e.g. the transcription factor PU.1) and growth factors (e.g. CSF1/IL\u201034). They share a core set of functions that largely arise from a uniquely high phagocytic capacity manifest in their ability to clear dying cells, pathogens and scavenge damaged, toxic or modified host molecules. However, macrophages demonstrate a remarkable degree of tissue\u2010specific functionality and have diverse origins that vary by tissue site and inflammation status. With our understanding of this diversity has come an appreciation of the longevity and replicative capacity of tissue\u2010resident macrophages and thus the realisation that macrophages may persist through tissue perturbations and inflammatory events with important consequences for cell function. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the parameters that regulate macrophage survival and function, focusing on the relative importance of the tissue environment versus cell\u2010intrinsic factors, such as origin, how long a cell has been resident within a tissue and prior history of activation. Thus, we reconsider the view of macrophages as wholly plastic cells and raise many unanswered questions about the relative importance of cell life\u2010history versus environment in macrophage programming and function.",

        "abstract": "Rationale The role of circulating fetal monocytes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not known. We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia. Methods Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen\u2009\u00d7\u200914 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n\u2009=\u20092 term, n\u2009=\u20093 moderate/late preterm, and n\u2009=\u20095 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n\u2009=\u20094 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay. Results Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 vs. 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vessels per lung field; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14. Conclusions Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.",
