        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the potential for additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy with the selective anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent etanercept and the anti-interleukin-1 agent anakinra.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred forty-four patients in whom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was active despite methotrexate therapy were treated with subcutaneous etanercept only (25 mg twice weekly), full-dosage etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day), or half-dosage etanercept (25 mg once weekly) plus anakinra (100 mg/day) for 6 months in a double-blind study at 41 centers in the US. Patients had never previously received anticytokine therapy. Patient response was measured with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria, a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Disease Activity Score. Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events and clinical laboratory values. Plasma concentrations of both agents and antibody formation against both agents were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCombination therapy with etanercept plus anakinra provided no treatment benefit over etanercept alone, regardless of the regimen, but was associated with an increased safety risk. Thirty-one percent of the patients treated with full-dosage etanercept plus anakinra achieved an ACR 50% response, compared with 41% of the patients treated with etanercept only. This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.914). The incidence of serious infections (0% for etanercept alone, 3.7-7.4% for combination therapy), injection-site reactions, and neutropenia was increased with combination therapy. Combination therapy had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or immunogenicity of either agent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombination therapy with etanercept and anakinra provides no added benefit and an increased risk compared with etanercept alone and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with RA.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the safety profile of anakinra after extended exposure in a diverse clinical trial population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: A six month, randomised, double blind phase comparing anakinra (100 mg/day) with placebo was followed by open label anakinra treatment for up to three years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs were permitted. Results: In all 1346 patients with rheumatoid arthritis received anakinra for up to three years. Patients had varying levels of disease severity, concomitant drug use, and comorbid conditions. Cumulative, exposure adjusted event (EAE) rates for all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and deaths were similar during each year of anakinra treatment; the overall rate (0 to 3 years) was similar to that observed for controls during the blinded phase. The most frequent AEs were injection site reactions (122.26 events/100 patient-years), rheumatoid arthritis progression (67.80 events/100 patient-years), and upper respiratory infections (26.09 events/100 patient-years). The EAE rate of serious infections was higher for patients treated with anakinra for 0 to 3 years (5.37 events/100 patient-years) than for controls during the blinded phase (1.65 events/100 patient-years). However, if the patient was not receiving corticosteroid treatment at baseline, the serious infection rate was substantially lower (2.87 event/100 patient-years). The overall incidence of malignancies was consistent with expected rates reported by SEER. Neutralising antibodies developed in 25 patients, but appeared to be transient in 12; neutralising antibody status did not appear related to occurrence of malignancies or serious infections. There were no clinically significant trends in laboratory data related to anakinra. Conclusion: Anakinra is safe and well tolerated for up to three years of continuous use in a diverse population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 blockers in rheumatoid arthritis are known to increase the risk of serious infections defined as life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics. Recently, new biological agents have become available. Their safety is an important issue. Purpose: To assess if biological agents, ie rituximab, abatacept and anakinra increase the risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in published randomised controlled trials. Data source: A systematic review of the literature using PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane library and abstracts databases (American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings) was performed up to October 2007. This search was completed with data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and manufacturers. Data extraction: Three fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed to compare serious infection rates between each biological agent and placebo. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method with a continuity correction. Data synthesis: Twelve randomised controlled trials with data concerning serious infections were analysed (three for rituximab, five for abatacept and four for anakinra). They included 745 patients, 1960 patients, 2062 patients and 2112 patients treated by rituximab, abatacept, anakinra and placebo respectively. The overall pooled ORs did not reveal a statistically significant increased risk of serious infection for abatacept and rituximab; this risk was increased for high doses of anakinra (\u2a7e100 mg daily) versus low dose and placebo (ORs\u200a=\u200a9.63 (95% CI, 1.31 to 70.91) and 3.40 (95% CI, 1.11 to 10.46) respectively). Conclusions: These meta-analyses did not reveal a significant increase in the risk of serious infections during rituximab or abatacept treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, high doses of anakinra may increase this risk, especially when patients have comorbidity factors. Large studies must be performed to confirm this safety profile in daily practice.",

        "abstract": "Significant advances in our understanding of RA and its management have been made in the past decade, resulting in earlier intervention with biologic DMARDs, particularly in patients with evidence of aggressive, erosive disease. Here, one such biologic therapy, the T-cell co-stimulation modulator abatacept, is discussed, exploring clinical evidence published to date on its use in patients with very early arthritis/early RA who are MTX na\u00efve, and in patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists. Data from relevant clinical trials are overviewed, discussing the clinical efficacy of abatacept in early disease, the clinical outcomes over long-term treatment in different patient populations and the effects of abatacept on structural damage. Findings from integrated safety analyses of abatacept clinical trial data, representing 10\u2009366 patient-years of exposure are described, and clinically important safety events, including serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune events, are highlighted. It is concluded that abatacept represents an effective treatment option with an established safety profile across different patient populations, including patients with both early and erosive RA and those with established disease. Furthermore, efficacy data from studies in patients with early disease suggest that the risk\u2013benefit profile of abatacept may be more favourable when introduced earlier in the treatment paradigm.",

        "abstract": "Objective. Current clinical trial designs for pharmacologic interventions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) do not reflect the innovations in RA diagnosis, treatment, and care in countries where new drugs are most often used. The objective of this project was to recommend revised entry criteria and other study design features for RA clinical trials. Methods. Recommendations were developed using a modified nominal group consensus method. Canadian Rheumatology Research Consortium (CRRC) members were polled to rank the greatest challenges to clinical trial recruitment in their practices. Initial recommendations were developed by an expert panel of rheumatology trialists and other experts. A scoping study methodology was then used to examine the evidence available to support or refute each initial recommendation. The potential influence of CRRC recommendations on primary outcomes in future trials was examined. Recommendations were finalized using a consensus process. Results. Recommendations for clinical trial inclusion criteria addressed measures of disease activity [Disease Activity Score 28 using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) > 3.2 PLUS \u2265 3 tender joints using 28-joint count (TJC28) PLUS \u2265 3 swollen joint (SJC28) OR C-reactive protein (CRP) or ESR > upper limit of normal PLUS \u2265 3 TJC28 PLUS \u2265 3 SJC28], functional classification, disease classification and duration, and concomitant RA treatments. Additional recommendations regarding study design addressed rescue strategies and longterm extension. Conclusion. There is an urgent need to modify clinical trial inclusion criteria and other study design features to better reflect the current characteristics of people living with RA in the countries where the new drugs will be used.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo compare drug survival of different anti-TNF drugs (infliximab, INF, etanercept, ETA, and adalimumab, ADA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) by analysing data collected from an Italian multicenter observational cohort study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients with RA or SpA registered in the MonitorNet database who started their first course of anti-TNF therapy were included. Overall drug survival was measured, along with specific reasons of discontinuation (inefficacy or adverse events). A first set of analyses using RA as reference category assessed the relationship between diagnosis and drug survival. A second set of analyses stratified by diagnosis (RA and SpA) used INF as reference drug. Adjustment for confounders was performed. The results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios (adjHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\n\n\nRESULTS\n2640 RA patients and 1220 SpA patients with a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 7.2-33.4) were included in the analyses. Patients with a diagnosis of SpA showed a lower risk of drug discontinuation with an adjHR (95%CI) of 0.81 (0.73, 0.90). In SpA, the subset of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) showed the best survival on treatment. In RA, both ETA and ADA showed a significantly lower probability of withdrawal when compared to INF [adjHR (95%CI) 0.46 (0.38, 0.56) and 0.68 (0.57, 0.81), respectively]. Similar results were found in SpA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug survival for SpA is longer than that in RA mainly due to the AS subgroup. In both RA and SpA, ETA and ADA showed a better retention on treatment when compared to INF.",

        "abstract": "Background Microscopic gut inflammation frequently occurs in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA), and is associated with a risk of evolution to Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Half of all SpA patients develop gut inflammation without associated gastro-intestinal symptoms. Two types of inflammation are seen: an acute type resembling infectious enterocolitis, and a chronic type, with features of early Crohn's disease. However, the relationship between gut inflammation and the need to initiate biologic therapy in SpA patients in daily clinical practice is not known. Objectives To assess the association between the presence or absence of microscopic gut inflammation, and the independent decision of the treating rheumatologist to initiate anti-TNF therapy in newly diagnosed SpA patients, after 18 months of follow-up. Methods The Ghent Inflammatory Arthritis and spoNdylitis cohorT (GIANT) is a prospective observational cohort study, following patients with a new diagnosis of axial or peripheral SpA, classified according to the ASAS criteria. Patients underwent an ileocolonoscopy at baseline to assess the presence of microscopic gut inflammation. None of the patients were on anti-TNF treatment at time of inclusion in the cohort. The decision to start anti-TNF therapy was made by the treating rheumatologist, who was unaware of gut histology. Results In this analysis we included 63 patients who underwent ileocolonoscopy at baseline and had at least 18 months of clinical follow-up: 51 patients had axial SpA (23 AS and 28 non-radiographic axial SpA), and 12 patients had peripheral SpA. Gut histology was normal in 31 patients, but microscopic gut inflammation was found in 32 (acute/chronic). During the 18 months of follow up 27 (42,9%) patients were started on anti-TNF therapy because of NSAID failure, BASDAI>4 and elevated CRP (national reimbursement criteria). Of the 31 patients with normal gut histology at baseline, 9 (29,0%) started TNF-blocking agents. In patients with gut inflammation at baseline, a significantly higher proportion (18/32 i.e. 56,2%) had been started on anti-TNF treatment (p=0,042). In the chronic inflammatory subset, treatment was initiated in 12 out of 21 (57,14%) patients, which was comparable to 6 out of 11 (54,55%) patients in the acute subset. Higher CRP value and ASDAS at baseline were associated with the initiation of anti-TNF therapy as well, but this is probably influenced by current reimbursement criteria. Patients in whom anti-TNF was started also tended to have higher SPARCC values (MRI SIJ) at baseline, although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0,069). BASDAI or BASMI at baseline were not significantly linked with start-up of anti-TNF therapy. There was also no significant difference between axial or peripheral SpA, nor between AS and nr-axSpA. Conclusions SpA patients with microscopic gut inflammation, elevated CRP or elevated ASDAS at baseline were more likely to be given anti-TNF within 18 months of follow up in daily clinical practice. As we previously could not demonstrate any link between CRP and presence of microscopic gut inflammation in SpA, we anticipate that gut inflammation might be an independent prognostic factor that may be relevant for daily clinical practice. These data solidify the role of gut inflammation as an important driver of disease severity in SpA. Disclosure of Interest None declared DOI 10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-eular.4971",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims In some Western countries, up to 50% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have subclinical gut inflammation. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and severity of gut inflammation and to determine clinical factors associated with colonic inflammation in Korean AS patients who performed ileocolonoscopy without evidence of established inf lammatory bowel diseases before. Methods One hundred and eight AS patients who underwent ileocolonoscopy were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups based on gross ileocolonoscopic findings; patients with inflammatory lesions, and patients without inflammatory lesions. Results Inf lammatory lesions in ileocolonoscopic findings were found in 40 patients. The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score C-reactive protein was higher in the group with inflammatory lesions and gut lesions were found often in the terminal ileum. The risk of inflammatory lesions was higher for AS patients whose symptoms required ileocolonoscopy than for AS patients who underwent routine ileocolonoscopy screening (odds ratio, 3.96). However, abnormal lesions were detected also in 17.6% of the patients who underwent ileocolonoscopy for routine screening and most of them were erosion and ulcer. Among patients with inflammatory lesions (n = 40), 23 showed subclinical gut inflammation associated with AS and 17 were diagnosed finally as Crohn\u2019s disease (n = 12), intestinal tuberculosis (n = 4), and ulcerative colitis (n = 1).

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Renal involvement was a common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Few reports have investigated the pathological characteristics and renal outcomes of AS patients with kidney disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological spectrums and the renal prognosis of AS patients with kidney disease. Methods: This retrospective and observational study was conducted working on 62 patients (47 males and 15 females) with a diagnosis of AS (ACR, 1984) and renal biopsies between 2008 and 2017. The histopathological findings and associated clinical manifestations were collected, and the renal prognoses of patients with kidney disease were evaluated too. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for the occurrence of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Results: Renal biopsy revealed that IgAN accounted for a majority (74.2%) of the kidney disease with AS, while membranous nephropathies, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and other lesions accounted for a small minority. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum immunoglobulin A >3.45 g/L and immunoglobulin G >9.06 g/L were risk factors for the occurrence of IgAN. With a median follow-up time of 24.3 months, 28 patients (50.9%) reached complete remission, 9 patients (16.4%) had partial remission, and 1 patient had an eGFR decline >30%. No difference was found in prognosis between IgAN and non-IgAN. Conclusion: IgAN occurred in 76.4% of the kidney disease with AS, and higher serum immunoglobulin A and G increased the risk for the occurrence of IgAN. The renal prognosis of kidney disease in AS was good.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the leading cause of adult-onset nephrotic syndrome, with primary MN of unclear cause accounting for 80% of cases. Retrospective clinical research reported that MN occurring in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients was triggered by nephrotoxic drugs or of unknown cause. However, whether RA or AS itself increases the risk of developing MN is unknown. Methods We conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal effects of RA or AS on MN using genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary analysis, and several supplementary analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the causal estimates. Results We obtained 30 valid instrumental variables (IVs) of RA and 16 valid IVs of AS from large-scale open-access GWASs. The genetically predicted RA significantly increased the risk of MN [IVW odds ratios (OR) = 1.327, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (1.124, 1.565), P = 8.051 \u00d7 10\u22124]. Three supplementary MR analyses provided the consistent positive causal effect of RA on MN (all P < 0.05). No horizontal pleiotropy was detected by MR Egger intercept analysis (P = 0.411). However, the genetically predicted AS had no causal effect on MN by IVW and supplementary analysis (all P > 0.05). Conclusions Genetically predicted RA could increase the risk of MN, but genetically predicted AS was not associated with MN. Screening for kidney involvement in RA patients should be noted, and active treatment of RA will reduce the public health burden of MN.",

        "abstract": "Key Clinical Message The coexistence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and PLA2R\u2010associated membranous nephropathy (MN) is uncommon. It is difficult to demonstrate whether the mechanisms of renal pathology are triggered by RA, but it has been observed that the pro\u2010inflammatory molecules present in RA increase the expression of PLA2R. Rituximab could be effective in both conditions. Abstract RA affects 0.5% of adults in our country. It is an inflammatory disease that predominantly affects the joints causing destruction of the articular cartilage. Approximately 50% of patients present extra\u2010articular manifestations. Renal involvement is relatively frequent and clinically significant because it worsens the course and mortality of the primary disease. The histological renal damage observed in these patients includes a wide variety of entities and histological patterns with both glomerular and tubulointerstitial involvement, with secondary MN being one of the most frequent. Coexistence with primary MN is rare. We present the case of a 46\u2010year\u2010old male recently diagnosed with RA who was referred to the nephrology department for renal function deterioration and subnephrotic proteinuria. The autoimmune study showed positive anti\u2010PLA2R. Due to the unusual association between both entities, it was decided to perform a renal biopsy which showed abundant spikes. The immunofluorescence study showed contiguous parietal IgG positivity (3+). Immunohistochemistry showed positive granular IgG4, confirming the diagnosis of PLA2R\u2010associated MN. MN is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. The determination of anti\u2010PLA2R has been a great advance in the rapid differential diagnosis of MN. In recent years, new target antigens associated with certain underlying pathologies have been discovered. However, PLA2R is not associated with any disease or exposure and therefore remains the antigen responsible for 80% of primary NMs. Anti\u2010PLA2R antibodies can be produced by loss of central or peripheral tolerance. Whether these mechanisms are triggered by RA itself is difficult to prove. The cytokine TNF\u2010like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) has been associated with RA. This proinflammatory molecule increases the expression of PLA2R in podocytes, sensitizing them to the damaging action of anti\u2010PLA2Rs, which could justify a causal relationship between the two pathologies. The anti\u2010PLA2R positivity in a patient with membranous nephropathy should not be sufficient to refrain from searching for a secondary cause, as a kidney biopsy is mandatory when another underlying disease coexists. Treatment should be tailored to the individual risk profile for progression. Rituximab could be an optimal option for both entities.",
