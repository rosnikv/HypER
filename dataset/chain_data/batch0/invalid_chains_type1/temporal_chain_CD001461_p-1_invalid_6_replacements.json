        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Although autoreactive T cells are thought to play a prominent role in autoimmune disease in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, it has been difficult to directly determine if autoreactive T cells escape from the thymus and react with self-antigens in the periphery. Defective expression of the Fas apoptosis antigen in MRL-lpr/lpr mice results from the insertion of the ETn retrotransposon. The fas defect can be partially corrected in CD2-fas transgenic mice in which the expression of fas is corrected in T cells. To identify a possible defect in clonal deletion or clonal anergy induction of auto-specific T cells, we have studied C57BL/6-lpr/lpr transgenic mice that express TcR genes that recognize a known self-antigen, the male H-Y antigen. In addition, we have analyzed clonal deletion and tolerance induction after neonatal tolerance induction and superantigen-induced arthritis with the class II MHC reactive superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in V beta 8 TcR transgenic and non-transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Neonatal tolerance induction to SEB was normal in lpr/lpr mice. However, over time a loss of tolerance (thymic or peripheral) was observed in lpr/lpr mice but not in +/+ TcR transgenic mice. This defect in lpr/lpr mice was thymic-dependent and was due to increased CD28/CTLA4 signaling. These results suggest that an apoptosis defect involving both thymocytes and peripheral lymphoid cells leads to autoimmune disease in lpr/lpr mice. The challenge in the future will be to determine the role of defective apoptosis in other autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nType B fibroblastic synoviocytes are abundant in inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and can secrete cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether cell lines derived from RA type B synoviocytes could also serve as accessory cells for T lymphocyte activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCells from RA synoviocyte lines, with or without preculture in interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), were cultured with purified peripheral blood T cells, in the presence or absence of superantigens or other accessory cell-dependent T cell mitogens. T cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation, and synoviocyte surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA type B synoviocyte lines were potent accessory cells for T cell responses to bacterial superantigens or lectins, and direct cell-cell contact was required. Preculture in IFN gamma augmented synoviocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and of ligands for some T cell costimulatory receptors, but synoviocyte accessory cell function was evident even in the absence of IFN gamma. Blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies supported the notion of a role CD2, CD11a/CD18 and MHC class II molecules in synoviocyte-dependent T cell activation. Monoclonal antibodies against IFN gamma, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha failed to block the T cell proliferative responses, but anti-IL-2 was strongly inhibitory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCultured RA and type B synoviocytes can perform some of the functions of professional antigen-presenting cells. If such cells have similar properties in vivo, they may be important participants in activation of immune responses, in addition to their previously described synthetic and proinflammatory roles. If RA synovial tissue T cells, like normal peripheral blood T cells, can respond to superantigens presented by synoviocytes, this interaction could be important in the pathogenesis of RA.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) persists inside macrophages despite vigorous immune responses. MTB and MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibit class II MHC (MHC-II) expression and Ag processing by a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent mechanism that is shown in this study to involve a defect in IFN-\u03b3 induction of class II transactivator (CIITA). Exposure of macrophages to MTB or MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced MHC-II expression, but not IL-4-induced MHC-II expression, by preventing induction of mRNA for CIITA (total, type I, and type IV), IFN regulatory factor-1, and MHC-II. MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein induced mRNA for suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 but did not inhibit IFN-\u03b3-induced Stat1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the lipoprotein inhibited MHC-II Ag processing in SOCS1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit translocation of phosphorylated Stat1 to the nucleus or Stat1 binding to and transactivation of IFN-\u03b3-sensitive promoter constructs. Thus, MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3 signaling independent of SOCS1 and without interfering with the activation of Stat1. Inhibition of IFN-\u03b3-induced CIITA by MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein may allow MTB to evade detection by CD4+ T cells.",

        "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins are important for the initiation of immune responses and are essential for specific recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system. Regulation of class II MHC expression primarily occurs at the transcriptional level. The class II transactivator protein is the master regulator that is essential for both constitutive and interferon-gamma-inducible class II MHC expression. Estrogen [17beta-estradiol (17beta-E2)] has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we show that 17beta-E2 down-regulates interferon-gamma inducible class II MHC protein levels on brain endothelial cells, as well as other cell types (astrocytes, fibrosacroma cells, macrophages). The inhibitory effects of 17beta-E2 on class II MHC expression are not due to changes in class II transactivator mRNA or protein levels, rather, 17beta-E2 mediates inhibition at the level of class II MHC gene expression. We demonstrate that 17beta-E2 attenuates H3 and H4 histone acetylation and cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein association with the class II MHC promoter, suggesting that 17beta-E2 inhibits class II MHC expression by a novel mechanism involving modification of the histone acetylation status of the class II MHC promoter.",

        "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

        "abstract": "CD4+ T cell responses to aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection are characterized by the relatively delayed appearance of effector T cells in the lungs. This delay in the adaptive response is likely critical in allowing the bacteria to establish persistent infection. Because of limitations associated with the detection of low frequencies of na\u00efve T cells, it had not been possible to precisely determine when and where na\u00efve antigen-specific T cells are first activated. We have addressed this problem by using early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6)-specific transgenic CD4 T cells to monitor early T cell activation in vivo. By using an adoptive transfer approach, we directly show that T cell priming to ESAT-6 occurs only after 10 days of infection, is initially restricted to the mediastinal lymph nodes, and does not involve other lymph nodes or the lungs. Primed CD4 T cells rapidly differentiated into proliferating effector cells and ultimately acquired the ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 ex vivo. Initiation of T cell priming was enhanced by two full days depending on the magnitude of the challenge inoculum, which suggests that antigen availability is a factor limiting the early CD4 T cell response.

        "abstract": "In recognition of World TB day (March 24), tuberculosis (TB) experts from New York State and vicinity met to discuss scientific progress and how it can impact control of TB. The meeting was held in Saranac Lake where Dr. E. L. Trudeau first cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) following the guidelines of Dr. Koch and also where Trudeau set up his successful TB sanitarium (Fig. 1). Many attendees were excited to visit this historical center of TB research and treatment however, they left with a profound sense of how much there remains to be done in order to bring TB under control. The majority of the meeting was in a workshop format with speakers providing a 15-min presentation of their recent work in three scientific sessions. The first session was entitled \u2018\u2018Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a potent pathogen\u2019\u2019, the second was \u2018\u2018Tuberculosis: the nature of the human disease\u2019\u2019 and the third was \u2018\u2018Cellular Immunity to tuberculosis: from animal models to human disease\u2019\u2019. At the end of these scientific sessions, a final open discussion session was held entitled \u2018\u2018Vaccination, Drugs and Public Health: the trifecta of tuberculosis control worldwide\u2019\u2019. This consisted of a focused discussion of what is required to improve vaccination, drug development and public health. The meeting was opened with a poem written by a student in 1908 in honor of Dr. E. L. Trudeau\u2019s 60th birthday. Dr. Trudeau started the Trudeau sanitarium and research facilities in Saranac Lake 125 years ago and his legacy lives on in the Trudeau Institute where the meeting was held. Mtb: a potent pathogen In the first session, the speakers stressed the importance of understanding the basic biology of mycobacteria in order to identify new drug targets and facilitate rational drug design.

        "title": "Lung Neutrophils Facilitate Activation of Naive Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection",
        "abstract": "Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node and requires transport of M. tuberculosis by migratory dendritic cells (DCs) to the local lymph node. The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

        "title": "Crosstalk between neutrophils and dendritic cells: a context\u2010dependent process",
        "abstract": "Neutrophils are massively and rapidly recruited following infection. They migrate to the site of acute infection and also transiently to dLNs. In addition to their well\u2010established role as microbial killers, accumulating evidence shows that neutrophils can play an immunoregulatory role. Neutrophils were recently shown to influence the activation of different leukocyte types including NK cells, B cells, and DCs. DCs are professional APCs playing a key role to the launching and regulation of the immune response; thus, crosstalk between neutrophils and resident or newly recruited DCs may have a direct impact on the development of the antigen\u2010specific immune response and thereby, on the outcome of infection. Neutrophils may regulate DC recruitment and/or activation. We will review here recent progress in the field, including those presented during the first international symposium on \u201cNeutrophil in Immunity\u201d, held in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, in June 2012, and discuss how neutrophil regulatory action on DCs may differ depending on the type of invading microorganism and local host factors.",

        "abstract": "Studies of tumor-infiltrating immune cells have revealed that immune escape plays an important role in tumor growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of metastasis affecting CD4+ T cell subsets in human clinical samples. Single-cell suspensions derived from tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) and primary cancer specimens were assessed by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In the CD4+ T cell subsets detected in TDLN, effector T cells (TE) in metastatic TDLN (mTDLN) was significantly lower than that in metastatic-free TDLN (mfTDLN). TE in mfTDLN were increased compared with normal controls. Similarly, effector memory T cells (TEM) in mTDLN was significantly lower than in control and mfTDLN. There was a significantly positive correlation between the proportion of TEM in TDLN and number of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Th1 to Th2 ratio was lower in mTDLN, and Treg in mTDLN was significantly higher than in mfTDLN. CD4+ T cell and TE subsets in TDLN were significantly affected by metastasis. Immunosuppressive cells exhibit increased migration to TDLN, in which a subset of CD4+ TE is skewed towards immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Infection of C57BL/6 mice with most Leishmania major strains results in a healing lesion and clearance of parasites from the skin. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain (LmSd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, LmSd elicited early upregulation of IL\u20101\u03b2 mRNA and IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin. Mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, or caspase\u20101/11, or lacking IL\u20101\u03b2 or IL\u20101 receptor signaling, developed healing lesions and cleared LmSd from the infection site. Mice resistant to LmSd had a stronger antigen\u2010specific Th1 response. The possibility that IL\u20101\u03b2 might act through neutrophil recruitment to locally suppress immunity was supported by the healing observed in neutropenic Genista mice. Secretion of mature IL\u20101\u03b2 by LmSd\u2010infected macrophages in vitro was dependent on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome and caspase\u20101. These data reveal that Nlrp3 inflammasome\u2010dependent IL\u20101\u03b2, associated with localized neutrophil recruitment, plays a crucial role in the development of a nonhealing form of cutaneous leishmaniasis in conventionally resistant mice.",

        "abstract": "The origin and functional specialization of dermal macrophages in cutaneous infections have been little studied. In this paper, we show that a strain of Leishmania major (L. major Seidman [LmSd]) that produces nonhealing cutaneous lesions in conventionally resistant C57BL/6 mice was more efficiently taken up by M2-polarized bone marrow (BM)\u2013derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro and by mannose receptor (MR)hi dermal macrophages in vivo compared with a healing strain (L. major Friedlin V1). Both in steady and in T helper type 1 (Th1) cell\u2013driven inflammatory states, the MRhi dermal macrophages showed M2 characteristics. The dermal macrophages were radio resistant and not replaced by monocytes or adult BM-derived cells during infection, but were locally maintained by IL-4 and IL-10. Notably, the favored infection of M2 BMDMs by LmSd in vitro was MR dependent, and genetic deletion of MR or selective depletion of MRhi dermal macrophages by anti\u2013CSF-1 receptor antibody reversed the nonhealing phenotype. We conclude that embryonic-derived, MRhi dermal macrophages are permissive for parasite growth even in a strong Th1-immune environment, and the preferential infection of these cells plays a crucial role in the severity of cutaneous disease.",

        "abstract": "IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interaction with eosinophils maintains dermis-resident macrophages as replicative niches for Leishmania major. Tight tissue associations The intracellular pathogen Leishmania major has been found to replicate in dermal tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) that have an M2-like phenotype, but L. major also promotes a strong TH1 immune environment. Here, Lee et al. show that dermal TRMs can maintain an M2 phenotype in this TH1 environment through IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interactions with eosinophils. Eosinophils were identified as the main source of IL-4 that drove local proliferation of dermal TRMs with M2 properties. IL-4 and IL-10 stimulation of dermal TRMs triggered production of CCL24, which promoted further eosinophil recruitment and close interactions with TRMs. These observations provide insight into this intercellular interaction that may have relevance to other inflammatory conditions. Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) maintain tissue homeostasis, but they can also provide a replicative niche for intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. How dermal TRMs proliferate and maintain their M2 properties even in the strong TH1 environment of the L. major infected dermis is not clear. Here, we show that, in infected mice lacking IL-4/13 from eosinophils, dermal TRMs shifted to a proinflammatory state, their numbers declined, and disease was attenuated. Intravital microscopy revealed a rapid infiltration of eosinophils followed by their tight interaction with dermal TRMs. IL-4\u2013stimulated dermal TRMs, in concert with IL-10, produced a large amount of CCL24, which functioned to amplify eosinophil influx and their interaction with dermal TRMs. An intraperitoneal helminth infection model also demonstrated a requirement for eosinophil-derived IL-4 to maintain tissue macrophages through a CCL24-mediated amplification loop. CCL24 secretion was confined to resident macrophages in other tissues, implicating eosinophil-TRM cooperative interactions in diverse inflammatory settings.",

        "abstract": "The term \u2018macrophage\u2019 encompasses tissue cells that typically share dependence on the same transcriptional regulatory pathways (e.g. the transcription factor PU.1) and growth factors (e.g. CSF1/IL\u201034). They share a core set of functions that largely arise from a uniquely high phagocytic capacity manifest in their ability to clear dying cells, pathogens and scavenge damaged, toxic or modified host molecules. However, macrophages demonstrate a remarkable degree of tissue\u2010specific functionality and have diverse origins that vary by tissue site and inflammation status. With our understanding of this diversity has come an appreciation of the longevity and replicative capacity of tissue\u2010resident macrophages and thus the realisation that macrophages may persist through tissue perturbations and inflammatory events with important consequences for cell function. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the parameters that regulate macrophage survival and function, focusing on the relative importance of the tissue environment versus cell\u2010intrinsic factors, such as origin, how long a cell has been resident within a tissue and prior history of activation. Thus, we reconsider the view of macrophages as wholly plastic cells and raise many unanswered questions about the relative importance of cell life\u2010history versus environment in macrophage programming and function.",

        "abstract": "Rationale The role of circulating fetal monocytes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not known. We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia. Methods Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen\u2009\u00d7\u200914 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n\u2009=\u20092 term, n\u2009=\u20093 moderate/late preterm, and n\u2009=\u20095 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n\u2009=\u20094 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay. Results Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 vs. 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vessels per lung field; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14. Conclusions Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.",
