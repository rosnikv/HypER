        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAcupuncture is commonly used by patients with chronic painful musculoskeletal disorders. There are, however, few well-designed studies of its efficacy. This paper describes a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design to evaluate acupuncture as a useful treatment adjunct in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-four patients were centrally randomized from a hospital-based rheumatology out-patient clinic. Fifty-six patients were suitable for study, all were on second-line therapy and aged 18-75 yr. There had been no change in therapy for the preceding 3 months. Patients who had previous acupuncture, anticoagulation, fear of needles or infection were excluded. Single-point (Liver 3) acupuncture or placebo was given with an intervening 6 week wash-out period. The acupuncturist, patient and statistician were blinded as far as possible. The outcome measures included the inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), visual analogue scale of pain, global patient assessment, 28 swollen and tender joint count, and a general health questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrated no significant effect of treatment or period and no significant interaction between treatment and period for any outcome variable. No adverse effects were reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcupuncture of this type cannot be considered as a useful adjunct to therapy in patients with RA. Possible reasons why this is the case are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAcupuncture has traditionally been used in China and is being increasingly applied in Western countries to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammatory disease. However, clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have yielded inconsistent results, and the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture-produced anti-inflammation are unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) on inflammation in a rat model.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFour experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8-9 per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw of the rat. Experiment 1: To determine the effect of EA (10 and 100 Hz) versus sham treatment on inflammation. Experiment 2: To investigate the involvement of the adrenal glands on the effect of EA treatment using adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. Experiment 3: To determine the effects of EA on plasma levels of corticosterone. Experiment 4: To determine the effects of EA treatment versus immobilization on such stress indicators as heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 10 Hz EA significantly reduced CFA-induced hind paw edema. The effect was partially blocked in the ADX rats. EA significantly increased plasma levels of corticosterone but produced no noticeable signs of stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAt 10 Hz but not 100 Hz, EA suppresses inflammation by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain syndrome characterised by central sensitisation resulting in hypersentivity of the skin and deeper tissues as well as fatigue. Possibly the princess in Hans Christian Andersen's \u2018The Princess and the Pea\u2019 suffered from FMS since chronic sleep disturbances are typical in FMS. These sleep disturbances have been attributed to a dysfunction in the systems regulating sleep and wakefulness resulting in loss of deep sleep. In addition, many patients with FMS experience cognitive dysfunction, characterised by impaired concentration and short term memory consolidation, a complaint also commonly reported in other sleep disorders. In recent reviews evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in FMS it has been concluded that acupuncture has no specific effect. A prerequisite for this conclusion is that all the major symptoms in the syndrome have been assessed. However, previous studies have generally focused on the pain alleviating effect of acupuncture in FMS. We have observed that not only pain but also sleep and cognitive dysfunction may be ameliorated in response to acupuncture, suggesting that these variables should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of acupuncture in FMS. Furthermore, the results demonstrated great individual variability apart from the systematic effects related to the group, indicating that individually performed treatment strategies are required. Our suggestion is supported by experimental and clinical studies showing that acupuncture may affect in somnia and alertness, and that there may be neurophysiologic bases for these specific effects.",

        "abstract": "Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), especially p38 MAPK, plays an important role in the development of central sensitization related to persistent inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is well known to relieve persistent inflammatory pain. However, little is known about relationship between EA and p38 MAPK. Inflammatory pain rat model was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into the saline group, CFA group, and CFA + EA group. EA (constant saquare wave, 2\u2009Hz and 100\u2009Hz alternating frequencies, intensities ranging from 1 to 2\u2009mA) was applied to bilateral \u201cZusanli\u201d (ST 36) and \u201cKunlun\u201d acupoints (BL 60) for 30\u2009min, once per day. The paw edema and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured at preinjection and days postinjection 1, 3, and 14. Spinal p-p38MAPK- immunoreactivty (p-p38MAPK-IR) cells were detected by immunohistochemistry at postinjection day 3 and 14. EA significantly inhibited paw edema at postinjection days 14 and increased PWT at postinjection days 3 and 14. Moreover, the increasing number of spinal p-p38MAPK-IR cells which was induced by CFA injection was suppressed by EA stimulation. These results indicate that anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of EA might be associated with its inhibition of spinal p38 MAPK activation and thereby provide a potential mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory pain by EA.",

        "abstract": "Our previous study indicated that electroacupuncture (EA) could increase neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels in the injured spinal cord, stimulate the differentiation of transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and improve functional recovery in the injured spinal cord of rats. However, the number of neuron-like cells derived from the MSCs is limited. It is known that NT-3 promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons by preferentially binding to its receptor TrkC. In this study, we attempted to transplant TrkC gene-modified MSCs (TrkC-MSCs) into the spinal cord with transection to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the injured spinal cord and to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance transplanted MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into neuron-like cells, resulting in increased axonal regeneration and functional improvement in the injured spinal cord. Our results showed that EA increased NT-3 levels; furthermore, it promoted neuron-phenotype differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelin formation of transplanted TrkC-MSCs. In addition, TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA (the TrkC-MSCs + EA group) treatment promoted the growth of the descending BDA-labeled corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and 5-HT-positive axonal regeneration across the lesion site into the caudal cord. In addition, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and hindlimb locomotor function increased as compared to controls (treated with the LacZ-MSCs, TrkC-MSCs, and LacZ-MSCs + EA groups). In the TrkC-MSCs + EA group, the injured spinal cord also showed upregulated expression of the proneurogenic factors laminin and GAP-43 and downregulated GFAP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major inhibitors of axonal growth. Together, our data suggest that TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment spinal cord injury not only increased MSC survival and differentiation into neuron-like cells but also promoted CST regeneration across injured sites to the caudal cord and functional improvement, perhaps due to increase of NT-3 levels, upregulation of laminin and GAP-43, and downregulation of GFAP and CSPG proteins.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can be obtained from various organs and easily propagated in vitro, are one of the most extensively used types of stem cells and have been shown to be efficacious in a broad set of diseases. The unique and highly desirable properties of MSCs include high migratory capacities toward injured areas, immunomodulatory features, and the natural ability to differentiate into connective tissue phenotypes. These phenotypes include bone and cartilage, and these properties predispose MSCs to be therapeutically useful. In addition, MSCs elicit their therapeutic effects by paracrine actions, in which the metabolism of target tissues is modulated. Genetic engineering methods can greatly amplify these properties and broaden the therapeutic capabilities of MSCs, including transdifferentiation toward diverse cell lineages. However, cell engineering can also affect safety and increase the cost of therapy based on MSCs; thus, the advantages and disadvantages of these procedures should be discussed. In this review, the latest applications of genetic engineering methods for MSCs with regenerative medicine purposes are presented.",

        "abstract": "Promoting remyelination is crucial for patients with demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis. However, it is still a circuitous conundrum finding a practical remyelinating therapy. Electroacupuncture (EA), originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat CNS diseases all over the world, but the role of EA in demyelinating diseases is barely known. In this study, we examined the remyelinating properties and mechanisms of EA in cuprizone-induced demyelinating model, a CNS demyelinating murine model of multiple sclerosis. By feeding C57BL/6 mice with chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks, we successfully induce demyelination as proved by weight change, beam test, pole test, histomorphology, and Western Blot. EA treatment significantly improves the neurobehavioral performance at week 7 (2 weeks after withdrawing cuprizone chow). RNA-seq and RT-PCR results reveal up-regulated expression of myelin-related genes, and the expression of myelin associated protein (MBP, CNPase, and O4) are also increased after EA treatment, indicating therapeutic effect of EA on cuprizone model. It is widely acknowledged that microglia exert phagocytic effect on degraded myelin debris and clear these detrimental debris, which is a necessary process for subsequent remyelination. We found the remyelinating effect of EA is associated with enhanced clearance of degraded myelin debris as detected by dMBP staining and red oil O staining. Our further studies suggest that more microglia assemble in demyelinating area (corpus callosum) during the process of EA treatment, and cells inside corpus callosum are mostly in a plump, ameboid, and phagocytic shape, quite different from the ramified cells outside corpus callosum. RNA-seq result also unravels that most genes relating to positive regulation of phagocytosis (GO:0050766) are up-regulated, indicating enhanced phagocytic process after EA treatment. During the process of myelin debris clearance, microglia tend to change their phenotype toward M2 phenotype. Thus, we also probed into the phenotype of microglia in our study. Immuno-staining results show increased expression of CD206 and Arg1, and the ratio of CD206/CD16/32 are also higher in EA group. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time that EA enhances myelin debris removal from activated microglia after demyelination, and promotes remyelination.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMicroglia play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis in complex brain environment. They first exist as amoeboid microglial cells (AMCs) in the developing brain, but with brain maturation, they transform into ramified microglial cells (RMCs). In pathological conditions, microglia are activated and have been classified into M1 and M2 phenotypes. The roles of AMCs, RMCs and M1/M2 microglia phenotypes especially in pathological conditions have been the focus of many recent studies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHere, we review the early development of the AMCs and RMCs and discuss their specific functions with reference to their anatomic locations, immunochemical coding etc. M1 and M2 microglia phenotypes in different neuropathological conditions are also reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nActivated microglia are engaged in phagocytosis, production of proinflammatory mediators, trophic factors and synaptogenesis etc. Prolonged microglia activation, however, can cause damage to neurons and oligodendrocytes. The M1 and M2 phenotypes featured prominently in pathological conditions are discussed in depth. Experimental evidence suggests that microglia phenotype is being modulated by multiple factors including external and internal stimuli, local demands, epigenetic regulation, and herbal compounds.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPrevailing views converge that M2 polarization is neuroprotective. Thus, proper therapeutic designs including the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, herbal agents may be beneficial in suppression of microglial activation, especially M1 phenotype, for amelioration of neuroinflammation in different neuropathological conditions. Finally, recent development of radioligands targeting 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in activated microglia may hold great promises clinically for early detection of brain lesion with the positron emission tomography.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic\u2013ischemic (H\u2010I) injury, which mainly causes neuronal damage and white matter injury (WMI), is among the predominant causes of infant morbidity (cerebral palsy, cognitive and persistent motor disabilities) and mortality. Disruptions to the oxygen and blood supply in the perinatal brain affect the cerebral microenvironment and may affect microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Microglia are significantly associated with axonal damage and myelinating oligodendrocytes, which are major pathological components of WMI. However, the effects of H\u2010I injury on microglial functions and underlying transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. The historical perception that these cells are major risk factors for ischemic stroke has been questioned due to our improved understanding of the diversity of microglial phenotypes and their alterable functions, which exacerbate or attenuate injuries in different regions in response to environmental instability. Unfortunately, although therapeutic hypothermia is an efficient treatment, death and disability remain the prognosis for a large proportion of neonates with H\u2010I injury. Hence, novel neuroprotective therapies to treat WMI following H\u2010I injury are urgently needed. Here, we review microglial mechanisms that might occur in the developing brain due to neonatal H\u2010I injury and discuss whether microglia function as a double\u2010edged sword in WMI. Then, we emphasize microglial heterogeneity, notably at the single\u2010cell level, and sex\u2010specific effects on the etiology of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss current knowledge of strategies aiming to improve microglia modulation and remyelination following neonatal H\u2010I injury.

If all of those abnormalities were addressed it should be possible to reverse the dementia; however, that would require a suffocating volume of drugs. Nevertheless, the problem may be simplified by using available data to address, instead, the brain cells whose functions become changed as a result of the abnormalities, because at least eleven drugs are available from which to formulate a rational therapy to correct those changes. The affected brain cell types are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells/pericytes, and microglia. The available drugs include clemastine, dantrolene, erythropoietin, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, minocycline, pioglitazone, piracetam, and riluzole. This article describes the ways by which the individual cell types contribute to AD\u2019s pathogenesis and how each of the drugs corrects the changes in the cell types. All five of the cell types may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD; of the 11 drugs, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, and pioglitazone, each address all five of the cell types. Fingolimod only slightly addresses endothelial cells, and memantine is the weakest of the remaining four. Low doses of either two or three drugs are suggested in order to minimize the likelihood of toxicity and drug\u2013drug interactions (including drugs used for co-morbidities). Suggested two-drug combinations are pioglitazone plus lithium and pioglitazone plus fluoxetine; a three-drug combination could add either clemastine or memantine.

This article describes the benefits provided to all of those brain cell types by GLP-1 agonist drugs. The article uses studies in humans, not rodents, to describe the effect of GLP-1 agonists upon cognition, because rodents\u2019 brains differ from those of humans in so many ways that results from rodent studies may not be totally transferable to humans. Commercially available GLP-1 agonists have mostly shown either positive effects upon cognition or no effects. One important reason for no effects is a reduced rate of entering brain parenchyma. Dulaglutide has the greatest entry to brain, at 61.8%, among the available GLP-1 agonists, and seems to offer the best likelihood for cure of AD. Although there is only one study of cognition that used dulaglutide, it was randomized, placebo controlled, and very large; it involved 8828 participants and showed significant benefit to cognition. A clinical trial to test the hypothesis that dulaglutide may cure AD should have, as its primary outcome, a 30% greater cure rate of AD by dulaglutide than that achieved by an equipoise arm of, e.g., lithium plus memantine.",
