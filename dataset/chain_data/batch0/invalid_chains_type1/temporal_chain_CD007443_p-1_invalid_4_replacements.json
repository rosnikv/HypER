        "abstract": "Recently, high interest has been attracted           to the research of inflammatory bowel diseases           (IBD). Recombinant probiotic bacteria may represent           an interesting way to influence the course of           IBD. Their benefits include cheap and simple production           and easy manipulation of the genetic material.           Several gene therapy and probiotic approaches           already showed promising results in the past. The           aim of this study was to test the probiotic potential of           IL-10-expressing Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in a mouse           model of IBD and to compare it with control bacterial           strains. The dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)           model of colitis was examined for this purpose. Animals           received control probiotic bacteria or modified           probiotics (expressing IL-10) via gastric gavage.           Body weight, stool consistency, food and water consumption           were monitored. At the end of the experiment,           the parameters of inflammation, oxidative           stress and carbonyl stress were analysed in the samples           and statistical analysis was performed. We prepared           an anti-inflammatory probiotic Escherichia           coli strain that we designated Nissle 1917/pMEC-IL10           and proved its anti-inflammatory properties, which           are similar to those of the control probiotic strains           Nissle 1917 and Lactococcus lactis/pMEC-IL10 in vivo.           The probiotic therapy was successful according to           several parameters, including colon length, and oxidative           and carbonyl stress. Bacterially produced           IL-10 was detected in the plasma. The potential of           bacterial anti-inflammatory therapy of IBD using           modified probiotics           was outlined. The results opened           a way for upcoming studies using modified probiotics           for therapy of systemic diseases.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo determine the efficacy profiles of different concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) for treating colitis using an experimental murine model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nColitis was established in 64 BALB/c mice by adding 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to the drinking water and allowing ad libitum access for 7 d. The mice were then randomly divided into the following control and experimental model groups (n = 8 each; day 0): untreated model control; negative-treatment model control (administered gavage of 1 mL/10 g normal saline); experimental-treatment models C4-C8 (administered gavage of 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7), or 10(8) CFU/10 g L. acidophilus, respectively); positive-treatment model control (administration of the anti-inflammatory agent prednisone acetate at 45 \u03bcg/10 g). Eight mice given regular water (no DSS) and no subsequent treatments served as the normal control group. Body weight, fecal traits, and presence of fecal occult blood were assessed daily. All animals were sacrificed on post-treatment day 7 to measure colonic length, perform histological scoring, and quantify the major bacteria in the proximal and distal colon. Intergroup differences were determined by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls comparison.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll treatments (L. acidophilus and prednisone acetate) protected against colitis-induced weight loss (P < 0.05 vs model and normal control groups). The extent of colitis-induced colonic shortening was significantly reduced by all treatments (prednisone acetate > C4 > C5 > C7 > C8 > C6; P < 0.05 vs untreated model group), and the C6 group showed colonic length similar to that of the normal control group (P > 0.05). The C6 group also had the lowest disease activity index scores among the model groups. The bacterial profiles in the proximal colon were similar between all of the experimental-treatment model groups (all P > 0.05). In contrast, the bacterial profile in the distal colon of the C6 group showed the distinctive features (P < 0.05 vs all other experimental-treatment model groups) of Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. being the most abundant bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus being the least abundant bacteria.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe most therapeutically efficacious concentration of L. acidophilus (10(6) CFU/10 g) may exert its effects by modulating the bacterial profile in the distal colon.",

        "abstract": "abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) generally comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and their main characteristic is the intestinal mucosa inflammation. Although its origin is not yet fully known, there is growing evidence related to genetics, intestinal microbiota composition, and the immune system factors such as precursors for the initiation and progression of intestinal conditions. The use of certain probiotic microorganisms has been touted as a possible and promising therapeutic approach in reducing the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically ulcerative colitis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of probiotics, indicating that some bacterial strains are able to positively modulate the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, and to produce metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this paper is to bring together the various results and information, based on scientific evidence, that are related to probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease, emphasizing the possible mechanisms involved in this action.",

        "abstract": "Disruption of the balance among the microbiota, epithelial cells, and resident immune cells in the intestine is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Probiotics exert protective effects against IBD, and probiotic commensal Lactobacillus species are common inhabitants of the natural microbiota, especially in the gut. To investigate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the development of IBD, L. acidophilus was administered orally in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. DSS-induced damage and the therapeutic effect of L. acidophilus were investigated. Treatment with L. acidophilus attenuated the severity of DSS-induced colitis. Specifically, it suppressed proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17 in the colon tissues, which are produced by T helper (Th) 17 cells. Moreover, in vitro L. acidophilus treatment directly induced T regulatory (Treg) cells and the production of IL-10, whereas the production of IL-17 was suppressed in splenocytes. In addition, we found that L. acidophilus treatment decreased the levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a marker of activated myofibroblasts, and type I collagen compared with control mice. These results suggest that L. acidophilus may be a novel treatment for IBD by modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, as well as fibrosis development.",

        "title": "High-fat Diet Induced Dysbiosis & Amelioration by Astaxanthin",
        "abstract": "Astaxanthin is a carotenoid that is present in high quantities in the meat of fish like salmon and the shells of shrimp and crab. It exhibits free radical scavenging antioxidant activity when consumed dietarily. Astaxanthin is absorbed by the small intestine before exerting its antioxidant effect; however, a portion of dietary intake remains unabsorbed in the digestive tract and reaches the large intestines . We hypothesized that astaxanthin may exert its antioxidant action in the large intestine to influence the gut microbiota. In this review we introduce the results of two studies of astaxanthin. Firstly, a clinical trial targeting post-menopausal women screened for high oxidative stress burden. Astaxanthin was administered orally for eight weeks in order to examine its effects and safety, and subjects were surveyed for any changes in subjective symptoms. Secondly, in a mouse model, real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was used to examine the ability of astaxanthin to prevent changes in the enteric flora induced by a high-fat diet. When fat intake increases due to changes in diet, the equilibrium between the various species that constitute the intestinal flora is altered. As a result, degenerative changes in lifestyle-related disease and aging of the host are promoted. Here we find that the intake of astaxanthin was able to inhibit these changes in the gut microbiota of mice induced by a high-fat diet. Even in humans, it is highly probably that the unabsorbed astaxanthin that remains in the intestinal tract exerts a positive effect against disturbance of the intestinal flora caused by a high-fat diet.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether administration of the microorganism Eubacterium rectale (E. rectale) could regulate dendritic cell (DC) activation and systemic inflammation in herpes simplex virus type 1-induced Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease (BD). E. rectale, butyrate-producing bacteria, was administered to BD mice. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and lymph node cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis was performed in the feces of mice to determine the differences in the composition of the microbial population between normal and BD mice. Serum cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of DC activation marker CD83 positive cells was significantly increased in PBL of BD mice. Frequencies of CD83+ cells were also significantly increased in patients with active BD. 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis revealed different gut microbiota composition between normal and BD mice. The administration of E. rectale to BD mice reduced the frequency of CD83+ cells and significantly increased the frequency of NK1.1+ cells with the improvement of symptoms. The co-administration of colchicine and E. rectale also significantly reduced the frequency of CD83+ cells. Differences in gut microbiota were observed between normal mice and BD mice, and the administration of E. rectale downregulated the frequency of CD83, which was associated with BD deterioration. These data indicate that E. rectale could be a new therapeutic adjuvant for BD management.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in the United States. There has been an increasing incidence and decreasing mortality rate of BC cases over the past several decades. Many risk factors are associated with BC, such as diet, aging, personal and family history, obesity, and some environmental factors. Recent studies have shown that healthy individuals and BC patients have different microbiota composition, indicating that microbiome is a new risk factor for BC. Gut and breast microbiota alterations are associated with BC prognosis. This review will evaluate altered microbiota populations in gut, breast tissue, and milk of BC patients, as well as mechanisms of interactions between microbiota modulation and BC. Probiotics and prebiotics are commercially available dietary supplements to alleviate side-effects of cancer therapies. They also shape the population of human gut microbiome. This review evaluates novel means of modulating microbiota by nutritional treatment with probiotics and prebiotics as emerging and promising strategies for prevention and treatment of BC. The mechanistic role of probiotic and prebiotics partially depend on alterations in estrogen metabolism, systematic immune regulation, and epigenetics regulation.",

        "abstract": "Aim Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common side effect during antibiotic treatment, which can cause dysbacteriosis of the gut microbiota. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects in AAD treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis XLTG11, Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probio-M9. However, no studies have been conducted on the immunomodulatory effects and protective intestinal barrier function of four complex probiotics. The aim of our study is to investigate the alleviation effects of complex probiotics on ampicillin-induced AAD. Methods Thirty-six BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group (NC), model control group (MC), low-, medium-, and high-dose probiotics groups (LD, MD, and HD), and positive drug (Bifico, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 cfu) control group (PDC; Bifico, also known as Bifidobacterium Triple Live Capsule, is composed of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Enterococcus faecalis). An AAD model was established by intragastric administration of ampicillin, by gavage of different doses of complex probiotics and Bifico. The weight gain, fecal water content, loose stool grade, intestinal permeability, total protein and albumin levels, intestinal barrier, cytokine levels, and gut microbiota were determined. Results The results showed that complex probiotics significantly decreased the fecal water content, loose stool grade, intestinal permeability, and ileum tissue damage. Their application increased the weight gain, SIgA, TP, and ALB levels. Additionally, complex probiotics significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased those of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and MUC2 were significantly upregulated in the probiotic-treated group. Furthermore, the complex probiotics increased the gut microbiota diversity and modulated the changes in the gut microbiota composition caused by ampicillin. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria in the HD group was lower than that in the MC group, whereas that of Bacteroidetes was higher. At the genus level, the abundances of Klebsiella and Parabacteroides in the HD group were lower, whereas those of Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae, and Lactobacillus were higher than those in the MC group. Moreover, Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis also found that several specific gut microbiota were significantly correlated with AAD-related indicators. Conclusion We found that complex probiotics improved the diarrhea-related indexes, regulated gut microbiota composition and diversity, increased the expression levels of intestinal protective barrier-related genes, preserved the intestinal barrier function, and relieved inflammation and intestinal injury, thereby effectively improving AAD-associated symptoms.
