        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo observe the clinical efficacy of the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the result of intestinal flora regulation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty IBS patients, 36 males and 24 females, were divided into two groups, with 30 patients in each group. Herbal formula of TongxieYaofang and clostridium butyricum (Cb) were used in the first group for four weeks, while only Cb was used for four weeks in the second group. We observed the changes of coliform group, enterococcus, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe effective rate of the Tongxie Yaofang and Cb treated group was significantly higher than that of the Cb treated group (P < 0.05). The numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus increased, while the numbers of coliform group and enterococcus decreased after the treatment, and the changes of intestinal flora in the integrative medicine treated group were significantly greater than those in the Cb treated group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAfter treatment with the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, the intestinal flora can be regulated to equilibrium state.",

        "abstract": "The clear delineation of a post-infective variety of IBS, as well as the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly, provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to emerge, a review of available trials emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of strain selection, dose and viability. The possible roles of co-therapy or sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or other agents also deserves further study. The role of the enteric flora is evidently an area of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era of research and therapy for this common disorder.",

        "title": "The Rationale and Clinical Effectiveness of Probiotics in Irritable Bowel Syndrome",
        "abstract": "The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unknown. However, several lines of epidemiological, physiological, and clinical data suggest a role for intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recent microbiology studies demonstrated differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. In addition, physiological studies have shown that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics can affect intestinal functions (eg, motility and sensation) relevant in the pathogenesis of IBS. Several randomized control trials comparing the effects of probiotics versus placebo in IBS have been published. Despite considerable differences in study design, dosing regimens, probiotic species used, and reported clinical end points, the current data indicate improving IBS symptoms and reducing the risk of persistent IBS symptoms. The data on the use of probiotics in children with IBS is more limited but is also suggestive for beneficial effects. The inconsistencies between the studies underline the need to look at each probiotic product separately for specific conditions, symptoms, and patient populations. This review article discusses the rationale for targeting the intestinal microbiota in patient with IBS and provides an overview and a critical evaluation of the currently available clinical data on the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with IBS.",

        "title": "Effective Constipation Treatment Changes More Than Bowel Frequency: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims The marketing of newer agents for treatment of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) emphasize improvements in abdominal pain. However, it is not clear whether this observation reflects a unique visceral analgesic effect of these agents or is a general feature of effective laxation. We sought to determine the relationship between improvements in bowel frequency and decreases in abdominal pain in clinical trials of patients with constipation or IBS-C. Methods We searched \u201cPubMed\u201d and \u201cEmbase\u201d databanks for clinical trials in patients with constipation or IBS-C, targeting publications that provided detailed data on bowel movement frequency and pain intensity before and after an intervention. We abstracted the results and performed meta-analytic and meta-regression analyses. Results Twenty-seven trials (16 constipation and 11 IBS) met entry criteria. Baseline weekly bowel movement frequency was low with 2.35 (2.07\u20132.64) with differences between constipation (2.00 [1.62\u20132.38]) and IBS-C (2.77 [2.40\u20133.14]; Q = 8.18; P = 0.002). Studies reported moderate pain levels (2.12 [1.81\u20132.42]) with comparable baseline levels in constipation (2.02 [1.63\u20132.42]) and IBS-C (2.35 [2.10\u20132.60]; Q = 1.92; P = 0.167). Treatments increased bowel frequency by 2.17 [1.88\u20132.47] and lowered pain ratings by 0.58 [0.49\u20130.68]. Meta-regression demonstrated a significant correlation between treatment-induced increases in bowel frequency and decreased pain ratings. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that reduction of abdominal pain observed in clinical trials of constipation and IBS-C is associated with laxation, and may not require specific drug mechanisms, thus arguing against a unique advantage of newer agents over traditional laxatives in the treatment of constipation and IBS-C.",

        "abstract": "c 2016 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility J Neurogastroenterol Motil, Vol. 22 No. 3 July, 2016 www.jnmjournal.org TO THE EDITOR: We read with interest the meta-analyses by Mazurak et al in which the authors suggest that the use of different probiotics appears to have limited evidence for efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Trials with single-strain probiotic revealed encouraging data in 20 of the 29 trials evaluated. Concerning the evaluation of yeasts, 3 studies employing Saccharomyces boulardii and 1 study with Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed. The studies with S. boulardii were negative. In the study of Pineton de Chambrun et al evaluating 179 IBS patients consuming 500 mg of S. cerevisiae or placebo during 8 weeks, improvement of abdominal pain was significantly higher (P = 0.04) in the verum group than the placebo group (63% vs 47%; OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.99-3.57) in the last 4 weeks of treatment. Mazurak et al suggest that \u201cthis sudden change in pain severity mimics a \u201crecruitment bias\u201d of unknown origin and lacks any rational discussion and explanation\u201d. We have difficulty with these comments. This study was performed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design with 2 parallel groups of IBS patients. The baseline characteristics of the patients showed no significant differences between groups particularly for the abdominal pain scores (3.16 \u00b1 1.1 vs 3.22 \u00b1 1.12; P = 0.76). The significant modification of scores in the last 4 weeks in the treatment group compared to placebo was observed for abdominal pain and not for other symptoms, excluding potential recruitment bias in our study. Concerning \u201cthe lack of rational discussion and explanation\u201d which may explain the efficacy of S. cerevisiae, we recommend reading the whole publication which describes the preclinical studies performed to select this particular strain of yeast. Briefly, S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 was selected from the Lesaffre yeast strain collection after demonstrating analgesic effects through a local activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in a model of colorectal distension in rats. This effect was dose-dependent with a maximal effect at 10 CFU/day, corresponding to the active dose of 500 mg used in our clinical trial. This effect was delayed and appeared 15 days after the beginning of treatment. Thus, we think that these preclinical evidences gave a good rationale to the use of S. cerevisiae to alleviate abdominal pain in IBS patients. Concerning S. boulardii, it has specific biochemical and genomic properties which may explain its different efficacy on abdominal pain. To conclude, we wanted to highlight that a second clinical study investigating the effect of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 in IBS patients has been published and confirms the results of this first clinical trial.",
