        "title": "Effect of rimonabant, a cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker, on weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight or obese patients: RIO-North America: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nRimonabant, a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker, may reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in patients who are overweight or obese.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of rimonabant with placebo each in conjunction with diet and exercise for sustained changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors over 2 years.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 3045 obese (body mass index > or =30) or overweight (body mass index >27 and treated or untreated hypertension or dyslipidemia) adult patients at 64 US and 8 Canadian clinical research centers from August 2001 to April 2004.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAfter a 4-week single-blind placebo plus diet (600 kcal/d deficit) run-in period, patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg/d of rimonabant, or 20 mg/d of rimonabant for 1 year. Rimonabant-treated patients were rerandomized to receive placebo or continued to receive the same rimonabant dose while the placebo group continued to receive placebo during year 2.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBody weight change over year 1 and prevention of weight regain during year 2. Additional efficacy measures included changes in waist circumference, plasma lipid levels, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt year 1, the completion rate was 309 (51%) patients in the placebo group, 620 (51%) patients in the 5 mg of rimonabant group, and 673 (55%) patients in the 20 mg of rimonabant group. Compared with the placebo group, the 20 mg of rimonabant group produced greater mean (SEM) reductions in weight (-6.3 [0.2] kg vs -1.6 [0.2] kg; P<.001), waist circumference (-6.1 [0.2] cm vs -2.5 [0.3] cm; P<.001), and level of triglycerides (percentage change, -5.3 [1.2] vs 7.9 [2.0]; P<.001) and a greater increase in level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (percentage change, 12.6 [0.5] vs 5.4 [0.7]; P<.001). Patients who were switched from the 20 mg of rimonabant group to the placebo group during year 2 experienced weight regain while those who continued to receive 20 mg of rimonabant maintained their weight loss and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. Use of different imputation methods to account for the high rate of dropouts in all 3 groups yielded similar results. Rimonabant was generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse event was nausea (11.2% for the 20 mg of rimonabant group vs 5.8% for the placebo group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this multicenter trial, treatment with 20 mg/d of rimonabant plus diet for 2 years promoted modest but sustained reductions in weight and waist circumference and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the trial was limited by a high drop-out rate and longer-term effects of the drug require further study. Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00029861.",

        "title": "Emerging role of cannabinoids in gastrointestinal and liver diseases: basic and clinical aspects",
        "abstract": "A multitude of physiological effects and putative pathophysiological roles have been proposed for the endogenous cannabinoid system in the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas. These range from effects on epithelial growth and regeneration, immune function, motor function, appetite control, fibrogenesis and secretion. Cannabinoids have the potential for therapeutic application in gut and liver diseases. Two exciting therapeutic applications in the area of reversing hepatic fibrosis as well as antineoplastic effects may have a significant impact in these diseases. This review critically appraises the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the clinical application of cannabinoid receptor-based drugs in gastrointestinal, liver and pancreatic diseases. Application of modern pharmacological principles will most probably expand the selective modulation of the cannabinoid system peripherally in humans. We anticipate that, in addition to the approval in several countries of the CB1 antagonist, rimonabant, for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic dysfunctions, other cannabinoid modulators are likely to have an impact on human disease in the future, including hepatic fibrosis and neoplasia.",

Special emphasis is placed on weighing the relative importance of CB1 receptors located in peripheral tissues versus the central nervous system in mediating the metabolic effects of endocannabinoids.

        "abstract": "Endocannabinoids and cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors have been implicated in cardiac dysfunction, inflammation, and cell death associated with various forms of shock, heart failure, and atherosclerosis, in addition to their recognized role in the development of various cardiovascular risk factors in obesity/metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In this study, we explored the role of CB1 receptors in myocardial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative/nitrative stress, cell death, and interrelated signaling pathways, using a mouse model of type 1 diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was characterized by increased myocardial endocannabinoid anandamide levels, oxidative/nitrative stress, activation of p38/Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), enhanced inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, cyclooxygenase 2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), increased expression of CB1, advanced glycation end product (AGE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end product [RAGE], angiotensin II receptor type 1 [AT1R]), p47(phox) NADPH oxidase subunit, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain isozyme switch, accumulation of AGE, fibrosis, and decreased expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of CB1 receptors attenuated the diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and the above-mentioned pathological alterations. Activation of CB1 receptors by endocannabinoids may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy by facilitating MAPK activation, AT1R expression/signaling, AGE accumulation, oxidative/nitrative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Conversely, CB1 receptor inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of diabetic cardiovascular complications.",

        "abstract": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been implicated in cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy associated with heart failure, and atherosclerosis, in addition to its recognized role in metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Numerous studies have presented contradictory findings about the role of HO-1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, we explored the role of HO-1 in myocardial dysfunction, myofibril structure, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model in mice systemically overexpressing HO-1 (Tg-HO-1) or mutant HO-1 (Tg-mutHO-1). The diabetic mouse model was induced by multiple peritoneal injections of STZ. Two months after injection, left ventricular (LV) function was measured by echocardiography. In addition, molecular biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated using classical molecular biological/biochemical techniques. Mice with DCM exhibited severe LV dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, aberrant cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and increased levels of HO-1. In addition, we determined that systemic overexpression of HO-1 ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in DCM mice. Furthermore, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation is normally inhibited in DCM, but overexpression of the HO-1 gene restored the phosphorylation of these kinases to normal levels. In contrast, the functions of HO-1 in DCM were significantly reversed by overexpression of mutant HO-1. This study underlines the unique roles of HO-1, including the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and the enhancement of autophagy, in the pathogenesis of DCM.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic erectile dysfunction is associated with penile dorsal nerve bundle neuropathy in the corpus cavernosum and the mechanism is not well understood. We investigated the neuropathy changes in the corpus cavernosum of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and the effects of Icariside II (ICA II) on improving neuropathy. Thirty-six 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into normal control group, diabetic group and ICA-II treated group. Diabetes was induced by a one-time intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Three days later, the diabetic rats were randomly divided into 2 groups including a saline treated placebo group and an ICA II-treated group (5 mg/kg/day, by intragastric administration daily). Twelve weeks later, erectile function was measured by cavernous nerve electrostimulation with real time intracorporal pressure assessment. The penis was harvested for the histological examination (immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining) and transmission electron microscopy detecting. Diabetic animals exhibited a decreased density of dorsal nerve bundle in penis. The neurofilament of the dorsal nerve bundle was fragmented in the diabetic rats. There was a decreased expression of nNOS and NGF in the diabetic group. The ICA II group had higher density of dorsal nerve bundle, higher expression of NGF and nNOS in the penis. The pathological change of major pelvic nerve ganglion (including the microstructure by transmission electron microscope and the neurite outgrowth length of major pelvic nerve ganglion tissue cultured in vitro) was greatly attenuated in the ICA II-treated group (p < 0.01). ICA II treatment attenuates the diabetes-related impairment of corpus cavernosum and major pelvic ganglion neuropathy in rats with Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Silymarin (SM), an extract from the Silybum marianum (milk thistle) plant containing various flavonolignans (with silybin being the major one), has received a tremendous amount of attention over the last decade as a herbal remedy for liver treatment. In many cases, the antioxidant properties of SM are considered to be responsible for its protective actions. Possible antioxidant mechanisms of SM are evaluated in this review. (1) Direct scavenging free radicals and chelating free Fe and Cu are mainly effective in the gut. (2) Preventing free radical formation by inhibiting specific ROS-producing enzymes, or improving an integrity of mitochondria in stress conditions, are of great importance. (3) Maintaining an optimal redox balance in the cell by activating a range of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants, mainly via Nrf2 activation is probably the main driving force of antioxidant (AO) action of SM. (4) Decreasing inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathways is an emerging mechanism of SM protective effects in liver toxicity and various liver diseases. (5) Activating vitagenes, responsible for synthesis of protective molecules, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), thioredoxin and sirtuins and providing additional protection in stress conditions deserves more attention. (6) Affecting the microenvironment of the gut, including SM-bacteria interactions, awaits future investigations. (7) In animal nutrition and disease prevention strategy, SM alone, or in combination with other hepatho-active compounds (carnitine, betaine, vitamin B12, etc.), might have similar hepatoprotective effects as described in human nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy. Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is a novel mitochondrial protective factor. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether SIRT3 protects against hyperglycemia-induced AFSCs damage and enhances the therapeutic efficiency of AFSCs in diabetic nephropathy. Methods: To establish the diabetic nephropathy model, db/ db mice were used. AFSCs were obtained and transplanted into the kidney tissue of db/ db mice. Gain-of-function assay with SIRT3 overexpression was performed in AFSCs via adenoviral transfections (Ad/SIRT3). Cellular viability and apoptosis were measured via MTT, TUNEL assay and western blotting. Mitochondrial function was assessed via JC1 staining, mPTP opening assay, mitochondrial respiratory function analysis, and immunofluorescence analysis of cyt-c. Mitophagy was assessed via western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Renal histopathology and morphometric analysis were conducted via H&E, Masson and PASM staining. Kidney function was detected via ELISA assay, western blotting and qPCR. Results: SIRT3 was downregulated in AFSCs under high glucose stimulation, where its expression was positively correlated with AFSCs survival and proliferation. Regaining SIRT3 activated mitophagy protecting AFSCs against high glucose-induced apoptosis via preserving mitochondrial function. Transplanting SIRT3-overexpressing AFSCs in db/db mice improved the abnormalities in glucose metabolic parameters, including the levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c and inflammatory markers. In addition, the engraftment of SIRT3-modified AFSCs also reversed renal function, decreased renal hypertrophy, and ameliorated renal histological changes in db/db mice. Functional studies confirmed that SIRT3-modified AFSCs promoted glomerulus survival and reduced renal fibrosis. Conclusion: Collectively, our results demonstrate that AFSCs may be a promising therapeutic treatment for ameliorating diabetes and the development of diabetic nephropathy and that the overexpression of SIRT3 in AFSCs may further increase the efficiency of stem cell-based therapy.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations between Sirt6, macrophages and diabetic nephropathy (DN). Immunohistochemical, western blot and RT-qPCR analyses were performed to detect the expression levels of Sirt6, the markers of podocytes and monocytes and related inflammatory factors in the tissues of rats with streptozocin-induced DN. A series of cell experiments in isolated culture or the co-culture of macrophages and podocytes were conducted to examine the effects of the overexpression of Sirt6 on macrophage transformation, podocyte apoptosis and associated genes, and analyses were performed using RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and western blot analysis, where appropriate. In the rat model of DN, injured podocytes were represented by the decreased protein expression levels of Nephrin and Sirt6, and by an increased Desmin expression. Additionally, the M1 phenotype transformation of macrophages was evidenced by the increased expression levels of CD86, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and by the decreased expression levels of CD206, Sirt6, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10. In vitro assays of macrophages and podocytes demonstrated that glucose promoted macrophage M1 transformation and podocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and attenuated Sirt6 expression. Macrophages transformed into the M2 phenotype following the overexpression of Sirt6 by the successful transfection of macrophages with a Sirt6 overexpression plasmid. Sirt6 was also overexpressed in podocytes. In a Transwell co-culture system, the overexpression of Sirt6 in macrophages (but not the overexpression of Sirt6 in podocytes) protected the podocytes from high-glucose-induced injury. However, the apoptosis of the podocytes overexpressing Sirt6 (induced by transfection with a Sirt6 overexpression plasmid) still increased when these podocytes were co-cultured with macrophages in high-glucose medium. These protective effects were evidenced by the inhibition of apoptosis, the upregulation of the expression levels of Bcl-2 and CD206, as well as by the decreased expression levels of Bax and CD86. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that Sirt6 protects podocytes against injury in a mimicked diabetic kidney microenvironment by activating M2 macrophages, indicating that Sirt6 can act as an immune response regulatory factor in DN-associated renal inflammatory injury.",

        "abstract": "The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has become a new strategy for treating diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the role of placenta derived mesenchymal stem cells (P-MSCs) in DKD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic application and molecular mechanism of P-MSCs on DKD from the perspective of podocyte injury and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy at the animal, cellular, and molecular levels. Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of podocyte injury-related markers and mitophagy-related markers, SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and TFAM. Knockdown, overexpression, and rescue experiments were performed to verify the underlying mechanism of P-MSCs in DKD. Mitochondrial function was detected by flow cytometry. The structure of autophagosomes and mitochondria were observed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, we constructed a streptozotocin-induced DKD rat model and injected P-MSCs into DKD rats. Results showed that as compared with the control group, exposing podocytes to high-glucose conditions aggravated podocyte injury, represented by a decreased expression of Podocin along with increased expression of Desmin, and inhibited PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, manifested as a decreased expression of Beclin1, the LC3II/LC3I ratio, Parkin, and PINK1 associated with an increased expression of P62. Importantly, these indicators were reversed by P-MSCs. In addition, P-MSCs protected the structure and function of autophagosomes and mitochondria. P-MSCs increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content and decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, P-MSCs alleviated podocyte injury and mitophagy inhibition by enhancing the expression of the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1-TFAM pathway. Finally, we injected P-MSCs into streptozotocin-induced DKD rats. The results revealed that the application of P-MSCs largely reversed the markers related to podocyte injury and mitophagy and significantly increased the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and TFAM compared with the DKD group. In conclusion, P-MSCs ameliorated podocyte injury and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy inhibition in DKD by activating the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1-TFAM pathway.",

        "abstract": "Introduction With the increasing prevalence of hypertension, the incidence of kidney diseases is also increasing, resulting in a serious public burden. Jiangya Tongluo decoction (JYTL), a recognized prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is commonly used to calm an overactive liver and reduce excess yang, while also promoting blood flow to alleviate obstructions in the meridians. Previous research has indicated that JYTL may help mitigate kidney damage caused by hypertension; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly assessed. Methods First, an amalgamation of UPLC-QE/MS and network pharmacology techniques was employed to pinpoint potential active components, primary targets, and crucial action mechanisms of JYTL in treating hypertensive nephropathy (HN). Then, we used spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) to evaluate the efficacy of JYTL on HN with valsartan as a positive reference. We also conducted DCFH-DA fluorescence staining in rat renal tissues to detect the level of ROS. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate further the effect of JYTL decoction on key targets and signaling pathways. Results Through UPLC-QE/MS and network analysis, 189 active ingredients and 5 hub targets were identified from JYTL. GSEA in the MitoCarta3.0 database and PPI network analysis revealed that JYTL predominantly engages in the Sirt1-mitophagy signaling pathway. Tanshinone iia, quercetin, and adenosine in JYTL are the main active ingredients for treating HN. In vivo validation showed that JYTL decoction could improve kidney function, ameliorate tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), and improve mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS production and regulating mitochondrial dynamics in SHRs. JYTL treatment could also increase the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf1, and TFAM, and activate PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Conclusion JYTL decoction may exert renal function protective and anti-fibrosis effects in HN by ameliorating mitochondrial function and regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1-mitophagy pathway.",
