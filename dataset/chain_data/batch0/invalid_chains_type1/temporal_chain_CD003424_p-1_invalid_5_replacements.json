        "title": "Gastrointestinal outcomes and confounders in cystic fibrosis.",
        "abstract": "Until the mid 20th century, children with cystic fibrosis (CF) died at a young age from a combination of malnutrition and suppurative lung disease. In the past three to four decades, coincident with new treatments for pulmonary complications and the use of high-calorie diets without restrictions on fat intake, there has been marked and progressive improvement in lung function, nutritional status and survival. However, treatment for pancreatic insufficiency, which affects most individuals with CF, remains largely unchanged, and there have been few advances in our understanding and management of gastrointestinal problems in this population. Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT), principally using enzyme extracts of porcine origin, has been the mainstay for treating maldigestion resulting from pancreatic insufficiency (PI) for over a century. Powdered PERT was instituted before the 1931 creation of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the subsequent Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 that required proof of safety and efficacy before approval of drugs for marketing. Enteric-coated microcapsules, the most commonly used PERT, have never been FDA approved. After the epidemic of fibrosing colonopathy in the early 1990s, a condition that was clearly related to high doses of exogenous pancreatic enzymes, the FDA initiated a process of re-evaluating the safety and efficacy of PERT. In 2004, the FDA released a draft of a new Guidance Document for public comment that stated that within the next 4 years, all manufacturers of current enzyme products will need to submit a New Drug Application to the FDA with proof of safety in manufacturing, stability and efficacy. The coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) is the traditional method of testing the clinical efficacy of PERT. CF clinicians have long recognized that there is a very wide range of CFA in patients with CF. Less well known is that there is marked variability in the actual amount of enzyme in each capsule. Capsules are overfilled so that the stated dosage reflects the least amount of enzyme activity present after a six-month shelf life. There is little correlation between CFA and enzyme dose when subjects are receiving a dose of PERT considered optimal by the caregiver and/or patient. Furthermore, a recent cross-sectional study showed no correlation between enzyme dose and growth or self-reported symptoms. Consequently, the common belief that PERT dose can be titrated to correct malabsorption and/or maldigestion using patient-reported relief of abdominal symptoms or stool bulk and consistency appears to be questionable. PERT may not completely correct PI even if given in adequate doses because the release and onset of activity is not synchronous with the presence of food in the proximal intestine, the site for optimal absorption. Furthermore, as discussed below, it is becoming evident that poorly understood nonpancreatic intestinal and/or hepatobiliary factors likely contribute to incomplete and variable nutrient assimilation in patients with CF. However, we lack tools to distinguish PERT-related factors that might contribute to treatment failure from other confounding factors. Ironically, as mouse models of CF were developed in the late 20th century, these animals did not develop lung or severe pancreatic manifestations. However, the mice have characteristic CF-like bowel obstruction and are proving to be excellent models for study of nonpancreatic gastrointestinal manifestations of CF. The combination of new ways to study gastrointestinal disease in CF that further our understanding of the pathophysiology of CF and the need to evaluate novel methods to study pancreatic and nonpancreatic causes of maldigestion and malabsorption led the CF Foundation to sponsor a workshop, which was held in Baltimore in May 2005. The goals of this workshop were to evaluate what is known about gastrointestinal issues leading to malabsorption, to consider other factors that may contribute to malabsorption and to identify ways to improve care of patients with CF. We set an agenda for further clinical and laboratory-based investigations that would help to elucidate the spectrum of causes of maldigestion and malabsorption. The workshop participants included clinicians and investigators with a variety of interests, members of the US and European regulatory agencies and individuals from industry who were involved in producing traditional PERT or developing novel PERT or diagnostic tests. \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

        "title": "Is it time to reevaluate methyl balance in humans?",
        "abstract": "S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is the major biological methyl donor. AdoMet's methyl group arises both from the diet (eg, methionine, choline, and betaine) and from de novo synthesis by the process of methylneogenesis. At least 50 AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions have been identified in mammals, and genomic analyses suggest that the final number will be much higher. Such methylation reactions play major roles in biosynthesis, regulation, and detoxification. Creatine synthesis is thought to account for the use of >70% of AdoMet-derived methyl groups in humans. This is not consistent with recent studies in mice, in which the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase gene was deleted (PEMT-/-). Loss of this hepatic enzyme resulted in a 50% decrease in plasma homocysteine, which suggests that it accounts for a major component of whole-body AdoMet utilization. A reexamination of human creatine metabolism showed that dietary creatine can account for as much as 50% of daily creatine requirements in nonvegetarians and, therefore, that estimates of creatine synthesis need to be reduced. We suggest that creatine synthesis is responsible for a smaller proportion of AdoMet-derived methyl groups than has been suggested and that phosphatidylcholine synthesis via phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase is a major consumer of these methyl groups.",

        "title": "Methyl balance and transmethylation fluxes in humans.",
        "abstract": "Various questions have been raised about labile methyl balance and total transmethylation fluxes, and further discussion has been encouraged. This report reviews and discusses some of the relevant evidence now available. The fact that, if needed, labile methyl balance is maintained by methylneogenesis appears to be established, but several aspects of transmethylation remain uncertain: definitive measurements of the rate of total transmethylation in humans of both sexes on various diets and at various ages; the extent to which synthesis of phosphatidylcholine has been underestimated; and the relative contributions of the 2 pathways for the formation of sarcosine (ie, N-methylglycine). The available evidence indicates that the quantitatively most important pathways for S-adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylation in mammals are the syntheses of creatine by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, of phosphatidylcholine by phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, and of sarcosine by glycine N-methyltransferase. Data presented in this report show that S-adenosylmethionine and methionine accumulate abnormally in the plasma of humans with glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency but not of those with guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency or in the plasma or livers of mice devoid of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity. The absence of such accumulations in the latter 2 conditions may be due to removal of S-adenosylmethionine by synthesis of sarcosine. Steps that may help clarify the remaining issues include the determination of the relative rates of synthesis of sarcosine, creatine, and phosphatidylcholine by rapid measurement of the rates of radiolabel incorporation into these compounds from L-[methyl-3H]methionine administered intraportally to an experimental animal; clarification of the intracellular hepatic isotope enrichment value during stable-isotope infusion studies to enhance the certainty of methyl flux estimates during such studies; and definitive measurement of the dietary betaine intake from various diets.",

        "abstract": "In the early 1930s, Banting and Best, the discoverers of insulin, found that choline could prevent the development of fatty liver disease (steatosis) in pancreatectomized dogs treated with insulin. Later work indicated that in rats and mice, diets deficient in labile methyl groups (choline, methionine, betaine, folate) produced fatty liver and that long-term administration of diets deficient in choline and methionine also caused hepatocellular carcinoma. These experiments not only linked steatosis and diabetes but also provided evidence, for the first time, of the importance of labile methyl group balance to maintain normal liver function. This conclusion is now amply supported by the observation of mice devoid of key enzymes of methionine and folate metabolism and in patients with severe deficiencies in these enzymes. Moreover, treatments with various methionine metabolites in experimental animal models of liver disease show hepatoprotective properties.",

        "abstract": "Evaluating the safety of traditional medicinal herbs and their major active constituents is critical for their widespread usage. Geniposide, a major active constituent with a defined structure from the traditional medicinal herb Gardenia jasminoides ELLIS fruit, exhibits remarkable anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic properties and has been used in a variety of medical fields, mainly for the treatment of liver diseases. However, geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity and methods for the early detection of hepatotoxicity have yet to be reported. In this study, geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity was investigated. In addition, candidate biomarkers for the earlier detection of geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity were identified using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach on a geniposide overdose-induced liver injury in a rat model. Using an accurate intensity-based, absolute quantification (iBAQ)-based, one-step discovery and verification approach, a candidate biomarker panel was easily obtained from individual samples in response to different conditions. To determine the biomarkers' early detection abilities, five candidate biomarkers were selected and tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Two biomarkers, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) and glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL), were found to indicate hepatic injuries significantly earlier than the current gold standard liver biomarker. This study provides a first insight into geniposide-induced hepatotoxicity in a rat model and describes a method for the earlier detection of this hepatotoxicity, facilitating the efficient monitoring of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.",

Geniposide is the main active ingredient extracted from Gardenia jasminoides, which has been suggested to exert excellent efficacy on inflammatory disease. Herein, in this study, we aimed to uncover the systematic understanding of the mechanism and effects of geniposide in ameliorating inflammatory responses in colitis. In brief, the TCMSP server and GEO DataSets were used to analyze the systematic understanding of the mechanism and effects of geniposide in ameliorating inflammatory responses in colitis. Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis of mice were administered with 25-100[Formula: see text]mg/kg of geniposide for 7 days by gavage. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Bone Marrow Derived Macrophage (BMDM) cell or RAW264.7 cell models were treated with 20, 50 and 100[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M of geniposide for 4[Formula: see text]h.

Additionally, Western blot was used to determine the relevant protein expression. As a result, Geniposide could ameliorate inflammatory responses and prevent colitis in DSS-induced acute colitis of mice by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Transcription 1 (Sirt1) dependent signaling via the suppression of nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Geniposide attenuated macrophage\u00a0differentiation in DSS-induced acute colitis of mice. Geniposide suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome and induced AMPK/Sirt1 signaling in LPS-induced BMDM cell or RAW264.7 cell models. In mechanism studies, the inhibition of AMPK/Sirt1 attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of geniposide in colitis. The activation of NLRP3 attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of geniposide in colitis.

The purpose of this study is to explore the function of Schisandrin B and its underlying molecular mechanisms in colitis. In this study, mice with colitis were induced by giving 2.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, MP) in the drinking water for seven days. Furthermore, TCMSP server and GEO DataSets were used to analyze the mechanism of Schisandrin B in colitis. It was found that Schisandrin B presented colitis in mice model. At the same time, Schisandrin B not only reduced inflammation in vivo and vitro model of colitis, but also suppressed the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in vivo and vitro model of colitis. In addition, Schisandrin B induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) / Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in model of colitis, and regulated AMPK protein at 316 sites. The inhibition of AMPK reduced the anti-inflammation effects of Schisandrin B on NLRP3 inflammasome. Apart from that, Schisandrin B decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial damage and reduced epithelial cells damage of colitis through regulating pyroptosis. Collectively, our novel findings for first time showed that, Schisandrin B suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation-mediated interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) level and pyroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells of colitis model through the activation of AMPK/Nrf2 dependent signaling-ROS-induced mitochondrial damage, which may be a significant therapeutic approach in the treatment of acute colitis.",

Ferroptosis is a newly discovered pattern of programmed cell death. Its main manifestation is the excessive accumulation of intracellular iron ion-dependent lipid peroxides. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is an important driving factor in the onset and development of DN. Ferroptosis is closely associated with renal intrinsic cell (including renal tubular epithelial cells, podocytes, and mesangial cells) damage in diabetes. Chinese herbal medicine is widely used in the treatment of DN, with a long history and definite curative effect. Accumulating evidence suggests that Chinese herbal medicine can modulate ferroptosis in renal intrinsic cells and show great potential for improving DN.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThis study aimed to examine the impact of CA on DN and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms of inflammation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe fed C57BL/6 mice injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. In addition, we stimulated NRK-52E cells with 20\u2009mmol/L d-glucose to mimic the diabetic condition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur findings demonstrated that CA effectively reduced blood glucose levels, and improved DN in mice models. Additionally, CA reduced kidney injury and inflammation in both mice models and in vitro models. CA decreased high glucose-induced ferroptosis of NRK-52E cells by inducing GSH/GPX4 axis. Conversely, the ferroptosis activator or the PI3K inhibitor reversed positive effects of CA on DN in both mice and in vitro models. CA suppressed PAQR3 expression in DN models to promote PI3K/AKT activity. The PAQR3 activator reduced the positive effects of CA on DN in vitro models. Moreover, CA directly targeted the PAQR3 protein to enhance the ubiquitination of the PAQR3 protein.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall, our study has uncovered that CA promotes the ubiquitination of PAQR3, leading to the attenuation of ferroptosis in DN. This effect is achieved through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways by disrupting the interaction between PAQR3 and the P110\u03b1 pathway. These findings highlight the potential of CA as a viable therapeutic option for the prevention of DN and other forms of diabetes.",
