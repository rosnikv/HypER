        "title": "A two year randomised controlled trial of intramuscular depot steroids in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis who have shown an incomplete response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs",
        "abstract": "Background: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), intramuscular (IM) pulsed depomedrone expedites an immediate response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Although IM depomedrone is also widely used to treat disease flares in patients treated with DMARDs, its effect on radiological progression has not been assessed. Objective: To evaluate the benefits of 120 mg IM depomedrone versus placebo in patients with established RA whose disease was inadequately controlled by existing DMARDs. Methods: In a 2 year prospective randomised controlled trial patients were assessed using the ILAR/WHO core dataset, disease activity score (DAS28), x ray examination of hands and feet scored by Larsen\u2019s method, and bone densitometry. Results: 291 patients with RA were screened, 166 were eligible, and 91 consented and were randomised. Disease activity improved more rapidly in the steroid treated patients than with placebo, but after 6 months no difference remained. A small but significant reduction in erosive damage in the steroid group compared with placebo was also found. More adverse reactions occurred in the steroid treated group than in the placebo patients (55 v 42), especially those reactions traditionally related to steroids (16 v 2), including vertebral fracture, diabetes, and myocardial infarction. Hip bone density fell significantly in steroid treated but not placebo patients. Conclusions: IM depomedrone improved disease activity in the short term and produced a small reduction in bone erosion at the cost of a significant increase in adverse events. Despite the initial benefit of IM depomedrone, when patients respond suboptimally to a DMARD they should not be given long term additional steroids but should be treated with alternative or additional DMARDs.",

        "title": "A systematic review of the effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults and an economic evaluation of their cost-effectiveness.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis report reviews the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, agents that inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nElectronic databases were searched up to February 2005.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nSystematic reviews of the literature on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were undertaken and industry submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) were reviewed. Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. Etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage. Etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. Infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nCorticosteroids constitute one of the most common treatments of RA. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether long-term corticosteroid use suppresses the progression of disability in RA patients with low disease activity state.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData collected from a large observational cohort of RA patients at our institution were analysed for 214 RA patients whose disease activity score (DAS) 28 and HAQ were available consecutively from October 2000 to October 2004. All 214 patients had average DAS 28 <3.2, meaning only those who had well-controlled RA disease activity were chosen as subjects. The subjects were divided into steroid users who received continuous corticosteroids every month and non-steroid users who did not receive consecutive corticosteroids continuously every month.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-five patients (25.7%) were corticosteroid users and 159 (74.3%) were non-users. Average prednisolone for the former group was 4.2 mg/day. No significant differences were observed among baseline variables and RA disease activity variables. However, for steroid users, HAQ progressively worsened with time and for non-steroid users, HAQ progressively improved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough DAS 28 and other variables may suggest well-controlled RA disease activity, functional capacity of patients on low-dose corticosteroids deteriorated. Thus, low disease activity state with corticosteroid may not represent the 'true' low disease activity state. Along with the achievement of a low disease activity state, long-term efficacy, prognosis, and the quality of remission need to be also considered in the tight control of RA activity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine, in real life practice, the impact of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on glucocorticoid (GC) use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis systematic monocenter retrospective before-after study enrolled all RA patients who started their first anti-TNF-alpha treatment between January 2004 and December 2006 and were followed more than 3 months after anti-TNF-alpha initiation. Paired comparisons were performed to compare GC intake during the year before anti-TNF-alpha initiation and during the first year of treatment; each patient was his/her own control. Comparisons between patients who reduced their oral prednisone intake and those who did not, were also performed to identify variables associated with prednisone decrease.\n\n\nRESULTS\n110 patients were included (90 females/20 males, age: 42.1+/-14.4 years, disease duration: 10.6+/-10.2 years). Etanercept was prescribed in 70 (63.6%) patients, adalimumab in 35 (31.8%) and infliximab in 5 (4.6%). At anti-TNF-alpha initiation, 79 patients (71.8%) were taking oral prednisone (mean dose 7.3+/-2.6 mg/d). Of the 82 prednisone-users (74.5% of patients), 62 (75.6%) had lowered prednisone doses, whereas 12 (14.6%) and 10 (12.2%) patients had stable or increased doses, respectively. Twelve patients (15.2%) discontinued oral prednisone. Overall, a significant decrease of 28% of oral prednisone use was observed. The only factors associated with oral prednisone decrease were higher initial prednisone daily doses (p=0.04) and female sex (p=0.04).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study showed a significant GC sparing-effect of anti-TNF-alpha in RA patients in real life practice that was observed for oral, parenteral and intra-articular administration, as early as the first 3 months of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Several prior investigations demonstrate an improvement in bone mineral density associated with use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). We compared the risk of osteoporotic fractures among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating a disease\u2010modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). A population\u2010based cohort study was conducted using health care utilization data (1996\u20132008) from a Canadian province and a U.S. commercial insurance plan. Patients with at least two RA diagnoses were identified, and follow\u2010up began with the first prescription for a DMARD. Drug regimens were categorized into three mutually exclusive hierarchical groups: (1) TNFi with or without nonbiologic DMARDs (nbDMARD), (2) methotrexate (MTX) without a TNFi, or (3) other nbDMARD without a TNFi or MTX. Main outcomes were hospitalizations for fractures of the hip, wrist, humerus, or pelvis based on diagnoses and procedure codes. The study cohort consisted of 16,412 RA patients with 25,988 new treatment episodes: 5856 TNFi, 12,554 MTX, and 7578 other nbDMARD. The incidence rate per 1000 person\u2010years for osteoporotic fracture were 5.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.50\u20137.45] for TNFi, 5.35 (95% CI 4.08\u20137.02) for MTX, and 6.38 (95% CI 3.78\u201310.77) for other nbDMARD. After multivariable adjustment for osteoporosis and fracture\u2010related risk factors, the risk of nonvertebral osteoporotic fracture was not different in either TNFi [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.57\u20131.98] or MTX (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.60\u20132.34) compared with nbDMARD.
