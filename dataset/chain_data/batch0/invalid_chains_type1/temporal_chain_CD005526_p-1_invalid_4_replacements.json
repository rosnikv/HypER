        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUrsodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) therapy leads to major improvements in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The benefit of long-term treatment is uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 145 patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis to receive ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (72 patients) or placebo (73 patients). After two years of follow-up, because of the benefit from ursodiol, all patients completing the study received ursodiol in an open trial and were monitored for two more years. The end points in the assessment of efficacy were as follows: progression of disease, as defined by the presence of hyperbilirubinemia, variceal bleeding, ascites, or encephalopathy; liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure; and liver transplantation (or a referral) or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDisease progressed significantly less frequently in the ursodiol group than in the placebo group (P < 0.002; relative risk, 0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.63). The probability of liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure and the probability of transplantation or death were significantly lower in the group assigned to ursodiol than in the group assigned to placebo (for transplantation alone, P = 0.003; relative risk, 0.21; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.66; for transplantation or death, P = 0.005; relative risk, 0.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.74). High bilirubin levels and, to a lesser extent, signs of cirrhosis at entry into the trial were predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or a referral, and transplantation or death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term ursodiol therapy slows the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis and reduces the need for liver transplantation.",

The first objective of this study was to assess the performance of certain prognostic indicators for PBC after the introduction of treatment with UDCA. Serum bilirubin is an important prognostic indicator for PBC and an important component of the Mayo model for grading patients into risk categories. In an analysis of patients enrolled in the Canadian multicenter trial, the Mayo score was calculated before and after treatment with UDCA. After treatment, the Mayo score continued to divide patients with PBC into groups with varying risk. In addition, the serum bilirubin alone was shown to do the same even after the introduction of treatment with UDCA. A second objective was to establish whether UDCA had an effect on long\u2010term (2\u2010 to 6\u2010year) survival in patients with PBC.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM\nUrsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment is an effective medical therapy for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however, 40% of PBC patients show an incomplete response to the UDCA therapy. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) transfusion in PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a single-arm trial that included seven PBC patients with a suboptimal response to UDCA treatment. UC-MSCs were first cultured, and then 0.5 \u00d7 10(6) cells/kg body weights were infused through a peripheral vein. UC-MSCs were given three times at 4-week intervals, and patients were followed up for 48 weeks. Primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of UC-MSC treatment, and secondary outcomes were to evaluate liver functions and patient's quality of life.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo obvious side-effects were found in the patients treated with UC-MSCs. Symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus were obviously alleviated in most patients after UC-MSC treatment. There was a significant decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels at the end of the follow-up period as compared with baseline. No significant changes were observed in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time activity, international normalized ratio, or immunoglobulin M levels. The Mayo risk score, a prognostic index, was also stable during the treatment and follow-up period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUC-MSC transfusion is feasible and well tolerated in patients with PBC who respond only partially to UDCA treatment, thus representing a novel therapeutic approach for patients in this subgroup. A larger, randomized controlled cohort study is warranted to confirm the clinical efficacy of UC-MSC transfusion.",

        "abstract": "The existing mismatch between the great demand for liver transplants and the number of available donor organs highlights the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies in patients with acute or chronic liver failure. The rapidly growing knowledge on stem cell biology and the intrinsic repair processes of the liver has opened new avenues for using stem cells as a cell therapy platform in regenerative medicine for hepatic diseases. An impressive number of cell types have been investigated as sources of liver regeneration: adult and fetal liver hepatocytes, intrahepatic stem cell populations, annex stem cells, adult bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, embryonic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. All these highly different cell types, used either as cell suspensions or, in combination with biomaterials as implantable liver tissue constructs, have generated great promise for liver regeneration. However, fundamental questions still need to be addressed and critical hurdles to be overcome before liver cell therapy emerges. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art in the field of stem cell-based therapies for the liver along with existing challenges and future perspectives towards a successful liver cell therapy that will ultimately deliver its demanding goals.",

The therapeutic mechanism of MSCs in IBD mainly focuses on cell-to-cell contact and paracrine actions. One of the promising therapeutic options for IBD can focus on exosomes of MSCs. MSCs hold promise for the treatment of IBD-associated colorectal cancer because of their tumor-homing function and chronic inflammation inhibition. Encouraging results have been obtained from clinical trials in IBD and potential challenges caused by MSCs therapy are getting solved.

        "title": "Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation Into Odontoblast-Like Cells and Endothelial Cells: A Potential Cell Source for Dental Pulp Tissue Engineering",
        "abstract": "Objectives Dental pulp regeneration is considered an ideal approach for treating dental pulp disease. Because pulp is composed of various cells, determining the proper seed cells is critical. We explored the potential of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) as seed cells for dental pulp regeneration. Methods Liquid extract of human treated dentin matrix (LE-TDM) was acquired to culture hUCMSCs. Odontoblast-specific markers were detected by western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays. Endothelial differentiation of hUCMSCs was examined according to VEGF induction by western blot, qRT-PCR, and Matrigel assays. hUCMSCs and VEGF-induced hUCMSCs (V-hUCMSCs) were also cocultured in vivo for the Matrigel plug assay and in vitro for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Finally, encapsulated mono-cultured hUCMSCs or cocultured hUCMSCs and V-hUCMSCs in scaffolds were injected into the root segments and transplanted into immunodeficient mice for dental pulp regeneration. Results Under LE-TDM induction, hUCMSCs expressed specific odontoblast markers (DSPP, DMP-1, DSP). Under VEGF induction, hUCMSCs expressed functional endothelial markers (CD31, eNOs, vWF). In vivo, the Matrigel plug assay indicated that cocultured hUCMSCs and V-hUCMSCs formed extensive vessel-like structures. RNA-seq results indicated that cocultured V-hUCMSCs exhibited high Hif-1 signaling pathway activity. Both the hUCMSCs mono-culture and coculture groups showed pulp-like tissue regeneration. The cocultured group showed more extracellular matrix and vascularization than the mono-cultured group in vivo. Conclusion hUCMSCs can differentiate into odontoblast-like cells and functional endothelial cells. Cocultured hUCMSCs and V-hUCMSCs formed vessel-like structures and regenerated dental pulp-like tissue. Therefore, hUCMSCs can be used as an alternative seed cell source for angiogenesis and dental pulp regeneration.",

        "title": "Impact of Donor Age on the Osteogenic Supportive Capacity of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Matrix",
        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been proposed as an emerging cell-based therapeutic option for regenerative medicine applications as these cells can promote tissue and organ repair. In particular, MSC have been applied for the treatment of bone fractures. However, the healing capacity of these fractures is often compromised by patient\u2019s age. Therefore, considering the use of autologous MSC, we evaluated the impact of donor age on the osteogenic potential of bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC. MSC from older patients (60 and 80 years old) demonstrated impaired proliferative and osteogenic capacities compared to MSC isolated from younger patients (30 and 45 years old), suggesting that aging potentially changes the quantity and quality of MSC. Moreover, in this study, we investigated the capacity of the microenvironment [i.e., extracellular matrix (ECM)] to rescue the impaired proliferative and osteogenic potential of aged MSC. In this context, we aimed to understand if BM MSC features could be modulated by exposure to an ECM derived from cells obtained from young or old donors. When aged MSC were cultured on decellularized ECM derived from young MSC, their in vitro proliferative and osteogenic capacities were enhanced, which did not happen when cultured on old ECM. Our results suggest that the microenvironment, specifically the ECM, plays a crucial role in the quality (assessed in terms of osteogenic differentiation capacity) and quantity of MSC. Specifically, the aging of ECM is determinant of osteogenic differentiation of MSC. In fact, old MSC maintained on a young ECM produced higher amounts of extracellularly deposited calcium (9.10 \u00b1 0.22 vs. 4.69 \u00b1 1.41 \u03bcg.\u03bcl\u20131.10\u20137 cells for young ECM and old ECM, respectively) and up-regulated the expression of osteogenic gene markers such as Runx2 and OPN. Cell rejuvenation by exposure to a functional ECM might be a valuable clinical strategy to overcome the age-related decline in the osteogenic potential of MSC by recapitulating a younger microenvironment, attenuating the effects of aging on the stem cell niche. Overall, this study provides new insights on the osteogenic potential of MSC during aging and opens new possibilities for developing clinical strategies for elderly patients with limited bone formation capacity who currently lack effective treatments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Replicative senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) caused by repeated cell culture undermines their potential as a cell therapy because of the reduction in their proliferation and therapeutic potential. Glutaminase-1 (GLS1) is reported to be involved in the survival of senescent cells, and inhibition of GLS1 alleviates age-related dysfunction via senescent cell removal. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the association between MSC senescence and GLS1. We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the effect of GLS1 inhibition on senolysis and the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Inhibition of GLS1 in Wharton\u2019s jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) reduced the expression of aging-related markers, such as p16, p21, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype genes, by senolysis. Replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs, which recovered after short-term treatment with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES), showed increased proliferation and therapeutic effects compared to those observed with senescent WJ-MSCs. Moreover, compared to senescent WJ-MSCs, replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs inhibited apoptosis in serum-starved C2C12 cells, enhanced muscle formation, and hindered apoptosis and fibrosis in mdx mice. These results imply that GLS1 inhibition can ameliorate the therapeutic effects of senescent WJ-MSCs in patients with muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, GLS1 is a key factor in modulating the senescence mechanism of MSCs, and regulation of GLS1 may enhance the therapeutic effects of senescent MSCs, thereby increasing the success rate of clinical trials involving MSCs.",
