        "abstract": "Elevated postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress increase the risks of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Green tea catechin possesses antidiabetic properties and antioxidant capacity. In the present study, we examined the acute and continuous effects of ingestion of catechin-rich green tea on postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in healthy postmenopausal women. Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3\u00a0h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0\u00a0h) and at 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3\u00a0% lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P<\u00a00\u00b705), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed. Conversely, serum postprandial thioredoxin concentrations were 5\u00a0% higher in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). These findings indicate that an acute ingestion of catechin-rich green tea has beneficial effects on postprandial glucose and redox homeostasis in postmenopausal women.",

        "title": "Antioxidative and Antidiabetic Effects of Natural Polyphenols and Isoflavones",
        "abstract": "Many polyphenols that contain more than two phenolic hydroxyl groups are natural antioxidants and can provide health benefits to humans. These polyphenols include, for example, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, chlorogenic acids, hesperidin, nobiletin, and isoflavones. These have been studied widely because of their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects. These effects may contribute to the prevention of diseases, such as diabetes. Insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and homeostasis are important factors in the onset of diabetes, a disease that is associated with dysfunction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to this dysfunction and the effects of antioxidants on the pathogenesis of diabetes have, therefore, been investigated. Here, we summarize the antioxidative effects of polyphenols from the perspective of their radical-scavenging activities as well as their effects on signal transduction pathways. We also describe the preventative effects of polyphenols on diabetes by referring to recent studies including those reported by us. Appropriate analytical approaches for evaluating antioxidants in studies on the prevention of diabetes are comprehensively reviewed.",

        "title": "Environmental effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation and interactions with climate change: UNEP Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, update 2017",
        "abstract": "The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels of experts that inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The EEAP focuses on the effects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, and materials, as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa , are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas will likely experience a reduction in UV radiation as ozone- and climate-driven changes affect the amounts of UV radiation reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces detailed Quadrennial Reports every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. , 2015, 14 ,1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Update Reports of recent and relevant scientific findings. The most recent of these was for 2016 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. , 2017, 16 , 107-145). The present 2017 Update Report assesses some of the highlights and new insights about the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change. A full 2018 Quadrennial Assessment, will be made available in 2018/2019.",

        "abstract": "Devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) is an herbaceous plant, which can be found in the arid steppes of South Africa, particularly in the Kalahari Desert. As traditional medicine, devil's claw has been long used in the forms of infusions, decoctions, tinctures, powders, and extracts. The main compounds of devil's claw are iridoid glycosides, such as harpagoside, harpagide, and procumbide, which are present in the plant tubers. Additionally, chemical constituents such as sugars (mainly the tetrasaccharide stachyose), triterpenoids (oleanolic and ursolic acid), phytosterols (primarily \u03b2\u2010sitosterol), aromatic acids (caffeic, cinnamic, and chlorogenic acids), and flavonoids (luteolin and kaempferol) can be found in the plant.",

        "abstract": "Revision operations have become a new issue after successful artificial joint replacements, and periprosthetic osteolysis leading to prosthetic loosening is the main cause of why the overactivation of osteoclasts (OCs) plays an important role. The effect of biochanin A (BCA) has been examined in osteoporosis, but no study on the role of BCA in prosthetic loosening osteolysis has been conducted yet. In this study, we utilised enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, computed tomography imaging, and histological analysis. Results showed that BCA downregulated the secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, interleukin\u20101\u03b1 (IL\u20101\u03b1), and IL\u20101\u03b2 to suppress inflammatory responses. The secretion levels of receptor\u2010activated nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB ligand, CTX\u20101, and osteoclast\u2010associated receptor as well as Ti\u2010induced osteolysis were also reduced. BCA effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed hydroxyapatite resorption by downregulating OC\u2010related genes in vitro. Analysis of mechanisms indicated that BCA inhibited the signalling pathways of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (P38, extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase, and c\u2010JUN N\u2010terminal kinase) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (inhibitor \u03baB\u2010\u03b1 and P65), thereby downregulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 and c\u2010Fos. In conclusion, BCA may be an alternative choice for the prevention of prosthetic loosening caused by OCs.",

        "abstract": "Natural alkaloids are polycyclic, nitrogen-containing, and basic compounds obtained from plants. In this review, the advances in bioactive alkaloids with respect to their chemical structures, herbal sources, and effects for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are discussed. Anti-osteoporosis alkaloids are classified into six categories based on the chemical structure, namely, isoquinoline alkaloids, quinolizidine alkaloids, piperidine alkaloids, indole alkaloids, pyrrolizidine alkaloids and steroidal alkaloids. They promote mesenchymal stem cells differentiation, improve osteoblast proliferation, stimulate osteoblast autophagy and suppress osteoclast formation. These natural alkaloids can regulate multiple signaling pathways, including interrupting the tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6- receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B interaction, inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B pathway in osteoclasts, activating the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway in osteoblasts, and triggering the wingless and int-1 pathway in mesenchymal stem cells. This review provides evidence and support for novel drug and clinical treatment of osteoporosis using natural alkaloids.",

        "title": "IKK/NF\u2010\u03baB and ROS signal axes are involved in Tenacissoside H mediated inhibitory effects on LPS\u2010induced inflammatory osteolysis",
        "abstract": "Periodontal disease and arthroplasty prosthesis loosening and destabilization are both associated with osteolysis, which is predominantly caused by abnormal bone resorption triggered by pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines. Osteoclasts (OCs) are critical players in the process. Concerns regarding the long\u2010term efficacy and side effects of current frontline therapies, however, remain. Alternative therapies are still required. The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of Tenacissoside H (TDH) in RANKL\u2010mediated OC differentiation, as well as inflammatory osteolysis and associated processes. In vitro, bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (BMMs) cultured with RANKL and M\u2010CSF were used to detect TDH in the differentiation and function of OCs. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of specific genes and inflammatory factors in OCs. Western blot was used to identify NFATc1, IKK, NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPK pathway, and oxidative stress\u2010related components. Finally, an LPS\u2010mediated calvarial osteolysis mouse model was employed to explore TDH's role in inflammatory osteolysis. The results showed that in vivo TDH inhibited the differentiation and resorption functions of OCs and down\u2010regulated the transcription of osteoclast\u2010specific genes, as well as Il\u20101\u03b2, Il\u20106 and Tnf\u2010\u03b1. In addition, TDH inhibited the IKK and NF\u2010\u03baB signalling pathways and down\u2010regulated the level of ROS. In vivo studies revealed that TDH improves the bone loss caused by LPS. TDH may be a new candidate or treatment for osteoclast\u2010associated inflammatory osteolytic disease.",
