        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low dose dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in glucocorticoid treated female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Forty one women ( \u2265 5 mg prednisolone/day) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study for 6 months where DHEA was given at 30 mg/20 mg ( \u2264 45/ \u2265 46 years) daily, or placebo, followed by 6 months open DHEA treatment to all patients. HRQOL was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, using four validated questionnaires and the patients' partners completed a questionnaire assessing mood and behaviour at 6 months. DHEA treatment increased serum levels of sulphated DHEA from subnormal to normal. The DHEA group improved in SF-36 \u201crole emotional\u201d and HSCL-56 total score (both p < 0.05). During open DHEA treatment, the former placebo group improved in SF-36 \u201cmental health\u201d (p < 0.05) with a tendency for improvement in HSCL-56 total score (p = 0.10). Both groups improved in McCoy's Sex Scale during active treatment (p < 0.05). DHEA replacement decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and haematocrit. There were no effects on bone density or disease activity and no serious adverse events. Side effects were mild. We conclude that low dose DHEA treatment improves HRQOL with regard to mental well-being and sexuality and can be offered to women with SLE where mental distress and/or impaired sexuality constitutes a problem.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory, multisystem autoimmune condition. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a naturally occurring inactive steroid which may possess disease activity modifying properties as well as the ability to reduce flares and steroid requirements.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of dehydroepiandrosterone compared to placebo in the treatment of people with systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE, Pub Med, EMBASE, Science Citation Index and ISI Proceedings as well as searching web sites of Genelabs, FDA and EMEA. (Searches undertaken in June 2006 unless otherwise specified).\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials of at least three months duration comparing DHEA to a placebo in people with SLE.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors assessed quality and extracted data.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nFrom the seven RCTs identified (842 participants) to date there is 'gold' ranking evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) that DHEA: had little clinical effect on disease activity in those with mild/moderate disease (measured by SLEDAI or SLAM) but one study demonstrated evidence of stabilisation or improvement in 8.3% more patients than those treated with placebo; had a modest but clinically significant improvement in health related quality of life measured by Patient Global Assessment, estimated as 11.5% (11.5 mm on a 100 mm scale) by meta-analysis; resulted in a greater number of patients experiencing adverse events, particularly androgenic effects such as acne where patients risk was doubled when compared to placebo (RR 2.2; 95% CI 1.65 to 2.83)\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nStudying effectiveness of DHEA for SLE is difficult, reflecting the problems of studying any treatment for a disease as complex as SLE. From the seven RCTs to date, there was evidence that DHEA had a modest but clinically significant impact on health related quality of life in the short term. Impact on disease activity was inconsistent, with DHEA showing no benefit over placebo in terms of change in SLEDAI in all but one of the 6 studies reporting this outcome. Long term outcomes and safety remain unstudied.",

        "title": "Efficacy and safety implications of molecular constructs of biological agents for rheumatoid arthritis",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Targeted biologic immunomodulatory therapies have had a major impact in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibition, B-cell depletion, interference in T-cell costimulation and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibition. Along with the recognition of the importance of early, aggressive disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) grounded in the use of methotrexate, the introduction of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) has provided significantly improved outcomes in patients with RA with a goal of true remission, or at least a state of very low disease activity, now possible in many. There are a number of methods to inhibit cytokines, cellular receptors and pathways of signal transduction that have been used thus far and are in development. In some cases, the method of target inhibition and differences in molecular construct has impacted efficacy and/or safety; whereas, in other cases, similar safety and/or efficacy signals across compounds have demonstrated class- or target-related effects. As the development of targeted therapies moves forward, it is increasingly important to understand the role of the target both in RA disease pathogenesis and normal host defense and the mechanisms of target inhibition. Areas covered: This review covers the targets of therapy for biologic agents in rheumatic diseases, their molecular constructs and implications on efficacy and safety, with focus on approved treatments for RA. Expert opinion: Advances in molecular biology have provided a number of different ways to impact pathobiologically relevant pathways and targets in terms of the molecular construct of individual compounds. The use of these agents have provided important mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis, and in some cases are associated with differences in efficacy and safety among agents even with the same downstream target. As bDMARDs identify promising mechanisms, oral agents that target or specifically regulate downstream pathways are made possible.",

Methods This phase III, 52-week study randomised 1164 patients with moderate-to-severe SLE (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment\u2014SLE Disease Activity Index \u22656 at baseline). Patients received SoC plus subcutaneous injections of tabalumab or placebo, starting with a loading dose (240\u2005mg) at week 0 and followed by 120\u2005mg every two\u2005weeks (120 Q2W, n=387), 120\u2005mg every four\u2005weeks (120 Q4W, n=389) or placebo Q2W (n=388).

Results Similar proportions of patients in each group achieved SRI-5 response at week 52 (120 Q2W: 31.8%; 120 Q4W: 35.2% and placebo: 29.3%). Key secondary endpoints were not met. In a sensitivity analysis not excluding patients who decreased antimalarials or immunosuppressants, SRI-5 response was achieved with 120 Q4W (37.0% vs 29.8% placebo; p=0.021), but not 120 Q2W (34.1%; p=0.171). Significant reductions in anti-dsDNA antibodies, increases in C3 and C4, and reductions in total B cells and immunoglobulins were observed with tabalumab.

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Imaging studies suggest potential changes to the classification and assessment of inflammatory musculoskeletal lupus. This is important because of the burden of disease but the potential for new targeted therapies. Recent findings Using our current classification and treatment, musculoskeletal symptoms continue to impact significantly on quality of life and work disability. Ultrasound and MRI studies suggested that new approaches to the diagnosis, classification, and evaluation of these symptoms are needed. Many patients with pain but no synovitis have ultrasound-proven joint and tendon inflammation but would not qualify for clinical trials or score highly on disease activity instruments. MRI studies show that erosions are more common than previously thought and may have a different pathogenesis than RA. Immunology studies suggest differences from other autoimmune synovitis, with a complex role for type I interferons. A wide range of biologic therapies appear more consistently effective for arthritis than some other manifestations. Summary Changes to the selection of patients for therapy and stratification using musculoskeletal imaging may offer new approaches to clinical trials and the routine care of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms. Outcomes may thereby be improved using existing therapies. There are significant knowledge gaps that must be addressed to achieve these potential improved outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Abnormalities in B cells play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). Breach in central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms generates autoreactive B cells which contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE and LN. Dysregulation of B cell transcription factors, cytokines and B cell\u2013T cell interaction can result in aberrant B cell maturation and autoantibody production. These immunological abnormalities also lead to perturbations in circulating and infiltrating B cells in SLE and LN patients. Conventional and novel immunosuppressive medications confer differential effects on B cells which have important clinical implications. While cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) showed comparable clinical efficacy in active LN, MMF induction was associated with earlier reduction in circulating plasmablasts and plasma cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that MMF maintenance is associated with lower risk of disease relapse than azathioprine, which may be explained by its more potent and selective suppression of B cell proliferation. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting the B cell repertoire include B cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies binding to cell surface markers, inhibition of B cell cytokines, and modulation of costimulatory signals in B cell\u2013T cell interaction. These biologics, despite showing improvements in serological parameters and proteinuria, did not achieve primary endpoints when used as add-on therapy to standard treatments in active LN patients. Other emerging treatments such as calcineurin inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors also show distinct inhibitory effects on the B cell repertoire. Advancement in the knowledge on B cell biology has fueled the development of new therapeutic strategies in SLE and LN. Modification in background treatments, study endpoints and selective recruitment of subjects showing aberrant B cells or its signaling pathways when designing future clinical trials may better elucidate the roles of these novel therapies for SLE and LN patients.",

        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by B cell dysregulation and breaks in tolerance that lead to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of B cells from healthy donors and individuals with SLE which revealed upregulated CD52 expression in SLE patients. We further demonstrate that SLE patients exhibit significantly increased levels of B cell surface CD52 expression and plasma soluble CD52, and levels of soluble CD52 positively correlate with measures of lupus disease activity. Using CD52-deficient JeKo-1 cells, we show that cells lacking surface CD52 expression are hyperresponsive to B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, suggesting an inhibitory role for the surface-bound protein. In healthy donor B cells, antigen-specific BCR-activation initiated CD52 cleavage in a phospholipase C dependent manner, significantly reducing cell surface levels. Experiments with recombinant CD52-Fc showed that soluble CD52 inhibits BCR signaling in a manner partially-dependent on Siglec-10. Moreover, incubation of unstimulated B cells with CD52-Fc resulted in the reduction of surface immunoglobulin and CXCR5. Prolonged incubation of B cells with CD52 resulted in the expansion of IgD+IgMlo anergic B cells. In summary, our findings suggest that CD52 functions as a homeostatic protein on B cells, by inhibiting responses to BCR signaling. Further, our data demonstrate that CD52 is cleaved from the B cell surface upon antigen engagement, and can suppress B cell function in an autocrine and paracrine manner. We propose that increased expression of CD52 by B cells in SLE represents a homeostatic mechanism to suppress B cell hyperactivity.",
