        "abstract": "A 1-year-old girl with severe left ventricular dysfunction presented with large floating thrombi in the left ventricle. Surgical thrombectomy was urgently required. During cannulation, transesophageal echocardiogram detected that the thrombus had vanished from the left ventricle. Whole body angiogram under very low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass successfully obtained the exact site of embolization with reducing total amount of contrast media in the operating room. Consequently, under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, the obstructive thrombi at the abdominal aorta were successfully removed using Fogarty catheters from ascending aortotomy. Although delayed sternal closure was postoperatively required, no complication including thromboembolic events were observed for a 1.5-year follow-up period.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExcessive inflammation is involved in preeclampsia (PE) pathogenesis. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an eicosanoid that counter-regulates inflammation. The main objective of this study was to determine LXA4 plasma levels in PE women. The correlations among LXA4 levels, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP) levels, and clinical/laboratory parameters of the studied participants were also investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLXA4 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 23 nonpregnant, 26 normotensive pregnant, and 27 PE women (early PE (N = 10) and late PE (N = 17)), according to gestational age (GA) at clinical symptoms onset). The clinical/laboratory parameters included in Spearman's correlation analysis were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, platelet count, proteinuria, and white blood cell count (WBC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nLXA4 levels were higher in PE women than in nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women, and similar between nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women. LXA4 plasma levels were higher in early PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA < 34 weeks) and in late PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA \u2265 34 weeks). No significant differences were detected between early and late PE. LXA4 levels were positively correlated with us-CRP levels, SBP, DBP, and WBC. No significant correlation was detected between LXA4 levels and the other laboratory parameters.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChronic inflammation in PE, in spite of increased levels of LXA4, points to a possible failure in this regulatory pathway. Further studies are necessary to clarify this issue and to evaluate the role of LXA4 and other proresolving mediators of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PE.",

        "title": "Annexin A1 and specialized proresolving lipid mediators: promoting resolution as a therapeutic strategy in human inflammatory diseases",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: The timely resolution of inflammation is essential to restore tissue homeostasis and to avoid chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution of inflammation is an active process modulated by various proresolving mediators, including annexin A1 (AnxA1) and specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), which counteract excessive inflammatory responses and stimulate proresolving mechanisms. Areas covered: The protective effects of AnxA1 and SPMs have been extensively explored in pre-clinical animal models. However, studies investigating the function of these molecules in human diseases are just emerging. This review highlights recent advances on the role of proresolving mediators, and pharmacological opportunities of promoting resolution pathways in preclinical models and patients with various human diseases. Expert opinion: Dysregulation or \u2018failure\u2019 in proresolving mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Altered levels of proresolving mediators were found in a wide range of human diseases. In some cases, AnxA1 and SPMs are up-regulated in human blood and tissues but fail to engage in proresolving signaling and, hence, to regulate excessive inflammation. Thus, the new concept of \u2018resolution pharmacology\u2019 could be applied to compensate deficiency of endogenous proresolving mediators\u2019 generation and/or possible failures in the engagement of resolution pathways observed in many chronic inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background: Carotid disease is one of the many forms of cardiovascular disease, which may lead to chronic disability and death. It is a multifactorial inflammatory disease, greatly affected by an individual\u2019s habits like smoking, lack of exercise, and a diet high in fats. MicroRNAs (miRs) are known to be involved in vascular inflammation. Objectives: We aimed to analyse in a case-control study the expression profile of selected miRs from patients with symptomatic carotid disease and to examine their involvement in the disease pathogenesis. Patients and Methods: Samples from 38 symptomatic patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy were collected and adjacent healthy regions from 15 patients were used as control samples. Fold change in the expression of miR21, miR122, miR146a and miR196\u03b1 was measured using reverse transcription-real time PCR. Western blot was used to quantify the levels of MMP2 protein whose gene is a target of miR21. Results: Compared to control samples, all patients showed upregulation of miR21, miR122, miR146a and miR196a. No statistical significance was found to exist from patients with high or low miRs expression and clinical/laboratory parameters. The levels of MMP2 were found to be decreased in patients when compared to control samples. Conclusions: Our results revealed miRs which showed different expression in endarterectomy specimens from patients with symptomatic carotid disease, suggesting that these miRs correlated with vascular inflammation. Furthermore, mir21 seems an appealing pharmaceutical target since by targeting MMP2 can favour a stable plaque since low levels of the protein of its gene MMP2 target prevent the fibrous cap of the atheroma from getting thinner. Thus, miR21 seems to prevent rupture but further research is required.",

        "abstract": "Gut microbes influence tumor development and progression in the intestines and may provide a novel paradigm for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut dysbiosis may be associated with the development and progression of CRC. Identifying the interactions between the colonic tract and gut microbiota may provide novel information relevant to CRC prevention. The present study examined the effects of butyrate-producing Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (B. pullicaecorum) on mice with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced CRC and the microbial metabolite of B. pullicaecorum on CRC cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the mouse colon tissues and reverse transcription PCR of CRC cells were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) transporter solute carrier family 5 member 8 (SLC5A8) and G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43). In CRC-bearing mice fed B. pullicaecorum, DMH-induced CRC regressed, body weight increased and serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels decreased. Notably, SLC5A8 and GPR43 were diffusely and moderately to strongly expressed in the neoplastic epithelial cells and underlying muscularis propria in the colons of the mice. In conclusion, administration of B. pullicaecorum or its metabolites improved the clinical outcome of CRC by activating the SCFA transporter and/or receptor. These results indicated that B. pullicaecorum was a probiotic with anti-CRC potential.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary The involvement of microbes (virus, fungi, bacteria) and diet in different cancers is slowly being uncovered, yet the complexity of the relationship between these factors has reduced the impact of potential interventions in the clinic. In this review we have highlighted the results of the most recent studies published and have related what the evidence suggests and how we can utilize this knowledge best in directing patients\u2019 diets and future research at this time. Abstract Many studies performed to date have implicated select microbes and dietary factors in a variety of cancers, yet the complexity of both these diseases and the relationship between these factors has limited the ability to translate findings into therapies and preventative guidelines. Here we begin by discussing recently published studies relating to dietary factors, such as vitamins and chemical compounds used as ingredients, and their contribution to cancer development. We further review recent studies, which display evidence of the microbial-diet interaction in the context of cancer. The field continues to advance our understanding of the development of select cancers and how dietary factors are related to the development, prevention, and treatment of these cancers. Finally, we highlight the science available in the discussion of common misconceptions with regards to cancer and diet. We conclude this review with thoughts on where we believe future research should focus in order to provide the greatest impact towards human health and preventative medicine.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that alterations in the gut microbiome impact the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although IBD often requires the use of immunosuppressant drugs and biologic therapies to facilitate clinical remission and mucosal healing, some patients do not benefit from these drugs, and the reasons for this remain poorly understood. Despite advancements, there is still a need to develop biomarkers to help predict prognosis and guide treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate the gut microbiome of IBD patients using biologics to identify microbial signatures associated with responses, following standard accepted criteria. Microbiomes in 66 stool samples from 39 IBD patients, comprising 20 CD and 19 UC patients starting biologic therapies, and 29 samples from healthy controls (HCs) were prospectively analyzed via NGS and an ensemble of metagenomics analysis tools. At baseline, differences were observed in alpha and beta metrics among patients with CD, UC and HC, as well as between the CD and UC groups. The degree of dysbiosis was more pronounced in CD patients, and those with dysbiosis exhibited a limited response to biological drugs. Pairwise differential abundance analyses revealed an increasing trend in the abundance of an unannotated genus from the Clostridiales order, Gemmiger genus and an unannotated genus from the Rikenellaceae family, which were consistently identified in greater abundance in HC. The Clostridium genus was more abundant in CD patients. At baseline, a greater abundance of the Odoribacter and Ruminococcus genera was found in IBD patients who responded to biologics at 14 weeks, whereas a genus identified as SMB53 was more enriched at 52 weeks. The Collinsella genus showed a higher prevalence among non-responder IBD patients. Additionally, a greater abundance of an unclassified genus from the Barnesiellaceae family and one from Lachnospiraceae was observed in IBD patients responding to Vedolizumab at 14 weeks. Our analyses showed global microbial diversity, mainly in CD. This indicated the absence or depletion of key taxa responsible for producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We also identified an abundance of pathobiont microbes in IBD patients at baseline, particularly in non-responders to biologic therapies. Furthermore, specific bacteria-producing SCFAs were abundant in patients responding to biologics and in those responding to Vedolizumab.",
