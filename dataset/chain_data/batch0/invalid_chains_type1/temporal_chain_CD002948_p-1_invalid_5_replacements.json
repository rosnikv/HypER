        "title": "Comparison of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F Versus Sulfasalazine in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Context In Chinese medicine, extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF, known as lei gong teng or thunder god vine) are used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Small clinical trials suggest that TwHF may benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Contribution This trial compared TwHF extract with sulfasalazine in 121 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who could continue oral prednisone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but not disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Among patients who continued treatment for 24 weeks, achievement of 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria was greater with TwHF than with sulfasalazine. Adverse event rates were similar. Caution Only 62% and 41% of patients continued TwHF and sulfasalazine treatment, respectively, and provided 24 weeks of data. The Editors Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joint lining (synovial membrane) (1), which causes pain and swelling of diarthrodial joints. Over time, uncontrolled disease results in progressive joint damage, disability, and increased mortality (2). The evolving understanding of the immune mechanisms that perpetuate the inflammatory response has led to effective targeted therapies, including inhibitors of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6), modulators of activation of CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells, and agents that deplete B cells (3, 4). Despite the clinical efficacy of these therapies, many patients have no clinically meaningful response or discontinue treatment because of adverse events. Furthermore, the limited availability of effective biologics in developing countries, the need for parenteral administration of the biologics, and the relatively high cost all restrict access to these therapies in many patients with rheumatoid arthritis around the world (5). In traditional Chinese medicine, extracts of the roots of the medicinal vine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) (known in China as lei gong teng or thunder god vine) have shown therapeutic promise in treating autoimmune and inflammatory conditions as well as cancer (68). More recently, different extracts of TwHF have been used in Chinese allopathic medicine for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and small controlled trials reported good responses with TwHF extracts in patients with cadaveric kidney transplants (9, 10) and Crohn disease (11). Of the approximately 380 metabolites isolated from the plant, 95% are terpenoids (12, 13). Three diterpenoidstriptolide, tripdiolide, and triptonide (13)are the most abundant and account for the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects observed with the root extracts in both in vitro and in vivo studies (6). In 2 previous single-center trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the extract was standardized by the content of triptolide and tripdiolide (14). This made it possible to use optimal doses identified in an open-label trial (15) for the design of a subsequent small placebo-controlled study (16). Although the number of patients was small, the apparent clinical impact and experimental results indicating potent inhibition of the expression of proinflammatory genes both in vitro and in vivo in animal models (1721) provided the rationale for our multicenter, double-blind, active comparator trial of a standardized TwHF extract in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Design Overview This randomized, controlled, 24-week study was conducted between March 2004 and October 2005. All participants provided written informed consent to enter the trial, and the institutional review boards at the participating sites approved the protocol. All investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment of the patients. Our objective was to determine whether therapy with TwHF extract, 180 mg/d, was statistically significantly better than therapy with sulfasalazine, 2 g/d, over 24 weeks in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by using standard outcome measures. Setting and Participants Our study was conducted at 11 U.S. centers: 2 academic centers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, and University of Texas, Dallas, Texas) and 9 rheumatology subspecialty clinics (1 each in Dallas and Austin, Texas; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Arlington, Virginia; Duncanville, Pennsylvania; Wheaton and Greenbelt, Maryland; and Lansing, Michigan). Eligible patients had to be at least 18 years of age and have established rheumatoid arthritis, defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria (22) as rheumatoid arthritis lasting longer than 6 months. Eligible patients had active disease, defined as 6 or more painful and swollen joints, a visual analogue scale score for pain of at least 3 (on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mild), and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 57.14 nmol/L or greater (0.6 mg/dL) or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 25 mm/h. Patients who were taking any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug at screening underwent a 28-day washout period. The use of oral prednisone, at stable doses up to 7.5 mg/d, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were allowed as long as the dose was not changed for 28 days before randomization and the patient agreed to continue to take the medication during the study. Table 1 lists baseline patient characteristics. Table 1. Patient Characteristics at Baseline Randomization and Interventions We used a computer-generated, pseudo-random code (with random, permuted blocks) to assign patients to treatment groups across all centers. We assigned eligible patients at a 1:1 ratio to receive either TwHF extract, 180 mg/d, or sulfasalazine, 2 g/d. In the event of gastrointestinal intolerance, the protocol allowed for temporary dose reduction of 50%. As described elsewhere (15, 16), the triptolide and tripdiolide content of the ethanol and ethylacetate extract (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography [22]) was used to standardize the drug preparation for this study. On the basis of data on in vitro activity and in vivo toxicity, 30 mg of TwHF extract were formulated per capsule. Our study was conducted under the U.S Food and Drug Administrationapproved Investigational New Drug application 39191. Outcomes and Measurements Patients were evaluated clinically and by laboratory measures at baseline, 2 weeks, and every 4 weeks for a total of 24 weeks. A rheumatologist or trained staff member masked to treatment allocation assessed the patients. Serum or plasma specimens were obtained from the patients at baseline, 4 weeks, and 24 weeks and stored at 80C until analysis. Radiographs of hands and feet were obtained at baseline and 24 weeks or at study discontinuation. The primary end point was a 20% improvement at 24 weeks, as defined by ACR criteria (ACR 20) (23). To meet criteria, a patient must have 20% or greater improvement in both tender and swollen joints (68 tender and 66 swollen joints were assessed) and 20% or greater improvement in 3 or more of the following: the physician's or patient's assessment of global health status, the patient's assessment of pain on a visual analogue scale, the patient's assessment of function (using a modified version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), and the serum CRP level. Secondary end points included the efficacy of TwHF in achieving ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses at 24 weeks, the improvement in the European League Against Rheumatism Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28) measure, and a change in the Sharpvan der Heijde score of the hand and foot radiographs (24). Radiographs were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study and were scored by 2 independent readers who were blinded to the randomization schedule and the radiograph sequence. Drug adherence was assessed by using a daily diary and by pill counts. Body weight, blood pressure, and serum glucose level were measured at each visit. Laboratory assessments included ESR (Westergren method); high-sensitivity CRP with normal levels up to 38.1 nmol/L (0.4 mg/dL), which was analyzed in a central laboratory; and interleukin-6 levels, which were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 24 weeks by using high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Rheumatoid factor was measured by immunonephelometry with a BNII analyzer (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Newark, Delaware), cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels by immunochemiluminescence methods with an Immulite 2500 (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angeles, California), and plasma lipids by Synchron LX-20 automated analyzers (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California). Safety assessments consisted of all patients marking adverse events in their drug diaries, which were reviewed on each visit. Vital signs and safety laboratory measures, including a complete blood count and a chemistry profile (electrolyte and liver and kidney function tests), were recorded at each visit. Adverse events were graded by severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria guidelines. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained from all patients at baseline, 2 weeks, and the end of study. After 24 weeks, no follow-up was conducted. Statistical Analysis We designed our study to detect differences in the primary end point with greater than 90% power at a 2-sided level of significance of 0.05. To properly account for missing end point data due to dropouts, we used mixed-effects analyses to predict each patient's ACR response at the end of study visit and to properly account for uncertainty in that prediction. The response was categorized according to the ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 criteria. In a similar manner, we compared changes in DAS 28 from baseline visit between treatment groups. We modeled the treatment group, visit number (2 random-effect terms for visit number and visit nu",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe increasing popularity of the use of complementary and alternative interventions or treatments appears to be particularly evident amongst people with chronic disease. In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, one therapy that has been identified as having potential benefit, is herbal medicine (phytotherapy).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness of herbal therapies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe developed a search strategy using terms to include all forms of arthritis combined with herbal medicine. We searched the following electronic databases from 1966 to 2000: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CISCOM, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), Cochrane Musculoskeletal specialized register, Dissertation Abstracts, BIDS ISI and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Fields Specialized Register. This was supplemented by searching the reference lists from retrieved trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nAll randomized trials of herbal interventions in rheumatoid arthritis, compared to placebo. Two reviewers independently read and selected each potential study according to the criteria published in an a priori protocol. Papers of any language were included.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted independently by the same two reviewers and an assessment of methodological quality was conducted.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nEleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven of the studies compared gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) to placebo although three of these were not suitable for data pooling. The remaining studies considered four different herbal interventions and were assessed individually. All of the GLA studies found some improvement in clinical outcomes but methodology and study quality was variable, making it difficult to draw conclusive results. However, the better quality studies suggest potential relief of pain, morning stiffness and joint tenderness. With the exception of one intervention (Tripterygium wilfordii hook F), no serious side effects were reported.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nThere appears to be some potential benefit for the use of GLA in rheumatoid arthritis although further studies are required to establish optimum dosage and duration of treatment. The single studies are inconclusive.",

        "title": "Andrographolide Interferes with T Cell Activation and Reduces Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in the Mouse",
        "abstract": "Andrographolide is a bicyclic diterpenoid lactone derived from extracts of Andrographis paniculata, a plant indigenous to South Asian countries that shows anti-inflammatory properties. The molecular and cellular bases for this immunomodulatory capacity remain unknown. Here, we show that andrographolide is able to down-modulate both humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. In vitro, this molecule was able to interfere with T cell proliferation and cytokine release in response to allogenic stimulation. These results were consistent with the observation that T cell activation by dendritic cells (DCs) was completely abolished by exposing DCs to andrographolide during antigen pulse. This molecule was able to interfere with maturation of DCs and with their ability to present antigens to T cells. Furthermore, in vivo immune responses such as antibody response to a thymus-dependent antigen and delayed-type hypersensitivity were drastically diminished in mice by andrographolide treatment. Finally, the ability of andrographolide to inhibit T cell activation was applied to interfere with the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is primarily mediated by CD4+ T cells and serves as an animal model for human multiple sclerosis. Treatment with andrographolide was able to significantly reduce EAE symptoms in mice by inhibiting T cell and antibody responses directed to myelin antigens. Our data suggest that andrographolide is able to efficiently block T cell activation in vitro, as well as in vivo, a feature that could be useful for interfering with detrimental T cell responses.",

        "title": "Virulent Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Evades Adaptive Immunity by Preventing Dendritic Cells from Activating T Cells",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) constitute the link between innate and adaptive immunity by directly recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in bacteria and by presenting bacterial antigens to T cells. Recognition of PAMPs renders DCs as professional antigen-presenting cells able to prime nai\u0308ve T cells and initiate adaptive immunity against bacteria. Therefore, interfering with DC function would promote bacterial survival and dissemination. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that have evolved in virulent bacteria to evade activation of adaptive immunity requires the characterization of virulence factors that interfere with DC function. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the causative agent of typhoid-like disease in the mouse, can prevent antigen presentation to T cells by avoiding lysosomal degradation in DCs. Here, we show that this feature of virulent Salmonella applies in vivo to prevent activation of adaptive immunity. In addition, this attribute of virulent Salmonella requires functional expression of a type three secretion system (TTSS) and effector proteins encoded within the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2). In contrast to wild-type virulent Salmonella, mutant strains carrying specific deletions of SPI-2 genes encoding TTSS components or effectors proteins are targeted to lysosomes and are no longer able to prevent DCs from activating T cells in vitro or in vivo. SPI-2 mutant strains are attenuated in vivo, showing reduced tissue colonization and enhanced T-cell activation, which confers protection against a challenge with wild-type virulent Salmonella. Our data suggest that impairment of DC function by the activity of SPI-2 gene products is crucial for Salmonella pathogenesis.",

        "title": "NF-kappa B, a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.",
        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that afflicts over 2 million people worldwide. On the basis of the temporal course of disease, MS can be subdivided into three clinical groups: relapsing remitting MS (RR-MS), secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. There is a high degree of clinical diversity within these subgroups. The pathogenesis of MS in most patients is likely to result from autoreactive, activated CD4(+) T cells moving from the periphery across the blood brain barrier into the CNS. Most therapeutic agents used in MS (e.g. immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs and cell cycle interruption drugs) are only used for RR-MS. These treatments show some efficiency in lessening the relapse rate in RR-MS and time to progression, but cannot cure MS. Thus, there is a need for new efficient treatments for all types of MS. An increasing number of studies indicate that nuclear factor-kappaB plays an important role in controlling expression of genes relevant to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Genetic factors related to NF-kappaB may also be determinants of MS susceptibility, as polymorphisms in the molecules involved in regulation of the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway differ between RR-MS and progressive MS. Herein, the role of NF-kappaB in MS will be reviewed and its potential as a new therapeutic target in MS will be considered and compared with existing treatments.",

        "abstract": "Tolerance induction by dendritic cells (DCs) is, in part, mediated by the activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We have previously shown in vitro that human DCs treated with glucocorticoids (GCs), IL-10, or TGF-\u03b2 upregulate the GC-Induced Leucine Zipper protein (GILZ). GILZ overexpression promotes DC differentiation into regulatory cells that generate IL-10\u2013producing Ag-specific Tregs. To investigate whether these observations extend in vivo, we have generated CD11c-GILZhi transgenic mice. DCs from these mice constitutively overexpress GILZ to levels observed in GC-treated wild-type DCs. In this article, we establish that GILZhi DCs display an accumulation of Foxp3+ Tregs in the spleens of young CD11c-GILZhi mice. In addition, we show that GILZhi DCs strongly increase the Treg pool in central and peripheral lymphoid organs of aged animals. Upon adoptive transfer to wild-type recipient mice, OVA-loaded GILZhi bone marrow\u2013derived DCs induce a reduced activation and proliferation of OVA-specific T cells as compared with control bone marrow\u2013derived DCs, associated with an expansion of thymus-derived CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells. Transferred OVA-loaded GILZhi DCs produce significantly higher levels of IL-10 and express reduced levels of MHC class II molecules as compared with OVA-loaded control DCs, emphasizing the regulatory phenotype of GILZhi DCs in vivo. Thus, our work demonstrates in vivo that the GILZ overexpression alone is sufficient to promote a tolerogenic mode of function in DCs.",

Despite these oscillators\u2019 importance, data from an oscillatory system is problematic for existing methods of regularized supervised learning. We present ZeitZeiger, a method to predict a periodic variable (e.g. time of day) from a high-dimensional observation. ZeitZeiger learns a sparse representation of the variation associated with the periodic variable in the training observations, then uses maximum-likelihood to make a prediction for a test observation. We applied ZeitZeiger to a comprehensive dataset of genome-wide gene expression from the mammalian circadian oscillator. Using the expression of 13 genes, ZeitZeiger predicted circadian time (internal time of day) in each of 12 mouse organs to within \u223c1 h, resulting in a multi-organ predictor of circadian time. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, ZeitZeiger was faster, more accurate and used fewer genes. We then validated the multi-organ predictor on 20 additional datasets comprising nearly 800 samples. Our results suggest that ZeitZeiger not only makes accurate predictions, but also gives insight into the behavior and structure of the oscillator from which the data originated. As our ability to collect high-dimensional data from various biological oscillators increases, ZeitZeiger should enhance efforts to convert these data to knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Cell therapy using T cells has revolutionized medical care in recent years but limitations are associated with the difficulty of genome editing of the cells, the production of a sufficient number of cells and standardization of the product. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-renew and differentiate into T cells to provide a standardized homogenous product of defined origin in indefinite quantity, therefore they are of great potential to alleviate limitations of therapeutic T cell production. The differentiation of hPSCs takes place in two steps: first the induction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), then the induction of lymphopoiesis by Notch signaling. However, the differentiation of T cells from hPSCs can be difficult and lack reproducibility. One parameter that needs to be better assessed is the potential of DLL1 vs. DLL4 ligands of the Notch pathway to induce T cells. In addition, culture of hPSCs is labor-intensive and not compatible with GMP production, especially when they are cultured on feeder cells. Thus, the definition of a robust GMP-compatible differentiation protocol from hPSCs cultured in feeder-free conditions would increase the accessibility to off-the-shelf hematopoietic and T cell progenitors derived from hPSCs. In this article, we describe an efficient, rapid and reproducible protocol for the generation of hematopoietic and T cell progenitors in two steps: (1) generation of HSPCs from embryoid bodies (EB) in serum free medium and GMP-compatible feeder-free systems, (2) directed differentiation of hPSC-derived HSPCs into T-cell progenitors in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells expressing Notch-ligands OP9-DLL1 vs. OP9-DLL4.",

        "abstract": "Background: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes are well recognized immunomodulating agents for cardiac repair, while the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. The Pericardial drainage pathway provides the heart with immunosurveillance and establishes a simplified model for studying the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulating effects of therapeutic exosomes. Methods: Myocardial infarction (MI) models with and without pericardiectomy (corresponding to Tomy MI and NonTomy MI) were established to study the functions of pericardial drainage pathway in immune activation of cardiac-draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN). Using the NonTomy MI model, MSC exosomes or vehicle PBS was intrapericardially injected for MI treatment. Via cell sorting and RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) analysis, the differentially expressed genes were acquired for integrated pathway analysis to identify responsible mechanisms. Further, through functional knockdown/inhibition studies, application of cytokines and neutralizing antibodies, western blot, flow cytometry, and cytokine array, the molecular mechanisms were studied. In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of intrapericardially injected exosomes for MI treatment was evaluated through functional and histological analyses. Results: We show that the pericardial draining pathway promoted immune activation in the MLN following MI. Intrapericardially injected exosomes accumulated in the MLN and induced regulatory T cell differentiation to promote cardiac repair. Mechanistically, uptake of exosomes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induced Foxo3 activation via the protein phosphatase (PP)-2A/p-Akt/forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) pathway. Foxo3 dominated APC cytokines (IL-10, IL-33, and IL-34) expression and built up a regulatory T cell (Treg)-inducing niche in the MLN. The differentiation of Tregs as well as their cardiac deployment were elevated, which contributed to cardiac inflammation resolution and cardiac repair. Conclusions: This study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the immunomodulation effects of MSC exosomes and provides a promising candidate (PP2A/p-Akt/Foxo3 signaling pathway) with a favorable delivery route (intrapericardial injection) for cardiac repair.",

        "abstract": "In efforts to find reparative strategies for brain damage, brain-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Beyond their textbook immunoregulatory function, Tregs have emerged as key players in the response to brain trauma and the restoration of damaged brain tissue. Here, we are the first to describe a novel, non-canonical function of Tregs in maintaining the sealing capacity of both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Moreover, we identified the cytokine IL-34 as a critical determinant in this newly unveiled Treg function. Mechanistically, IL-34 exerts its influence by modulating the expression and localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in both BBB endothelial cells and choroid plexus epithelial cells, thereby reinforcing the strength of the brain barriers. Given the well-established notion of leaky brain barriers and the involvement of immunological components in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), we further demonstrate diminished IL-34 expression in Tregs derived from patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) and patients with AD and even mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Remarkably, our study reveals the potential of IL-34 treatment in reinstating the integrity of brain barriers within murine models mimicking these neurological disorders. These ground-breaking findings shed light on the intricate relationship between Tregs, IL-34, and the integrity of brain barriers. They offer novel avenues for therapeutic approaches to ameliorate brain barrier dysfunction in the context of neurological disorders.",
