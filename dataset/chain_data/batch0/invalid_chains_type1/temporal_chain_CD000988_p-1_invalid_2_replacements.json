        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nChanges in blood rheology have been described in diabetes mellitus. Buflomedil, a vasoactive substance with hemorheological properties, has been widely used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of buflomedil on clinical and hemorheological parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes and intermittent claudication.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty patients were randomly assigned to oral buflomedil or matching placebo for six months in a double-blind manner. Initial and absolute walking distances were assessed by a standard treadmill testing protocol. Erythrocyte deformability was estimated with a whole blood filtration technique. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was assessed with an aggregation profiler. beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 were measured with radioimmunoassays. All tests were performed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant increase in the mean initial (71%) and absolute (68%) walking distance was achieved only in the buflomedil group. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in the buflomedil group, while no significant changes in erythrocyte deformability, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 levels were noticed. However, beta-thromboglobulin levels increased significantly in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest the therapeutic efficacy of buflomedil in diabetic subjects with intermittent claudication. The inhibition of platelet aggregation and the influence on platelet activity exerted by the drug could play an important role in its clinical effect and may be of value in the treatment of such patients.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) encompasses the vascular diseases caused primarily by atherosclerosis and thromboembolic pathophysiological processes that alter the normal structure and function of the aorta, its visceral arterial branches and the arteries of the upper and lower extremities. PAD is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The goals for pharmacological therapy in PAD should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk, improving walking distance and preventing critical limb ischaemia. Exercise training plays a key role in the therapeutic assessment, as well stopping smoking. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) should be given to every PAD patient if there are no contraindications. Neither their combination nor anticoagulant therapy has shown additional benefit in PAD patients. Several pharmacological agents have been developed to improve the functional state of the claudicant and to relieve the symptoms. Many studied drugs have shown either no, a small or a potential benefit. With future development of new drugs for PAD, there is an absolute need for very strict well-designed protocols in order to evaluate the claudication distance, the progression of the disease and the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. New developments should focus on improvement of endothelial function, vascular repair and enhancement of collateral circulation.",

        "abstract": "risk for different vascular diseases; the risk is highest for AAAs and PAD and lowest for cerebrovascular disease and IHD. Smoking reverses the beneficial effects of primary and secondary prevention measures; in patients with IHD taking aspirin, cigarette smoking acutely increases platelet thrombus formation. Smoking also diminishes the beneficial effect of statins on the cardiovascular system, besides increasing the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Smoking cessation plays a key role in the management of patients with vascular disease, such as stroke and PAD. Smoking cessation may also inhibit AAA expansion. A recent review concluded that cigarette smoking is an independent, major vascular risk factor for the development of aortic disease, especially the formation and growth of AAAs. Even nonsmokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke (passive smokers) experience an almost 30% excess risk of IHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction. It was suggested that a higher oxidative stress (as a result of trace element imbalance) may be a contributing factor to AAA formation by promoting wall erosion. Smoking is associated with high oxidative stress; thus, it should be expected that smoking will be associated with AAA formation. Experimental studies in mice and rabbits as well as large epidemiological studies on humans have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is strongly associated with the formation and growth of AAAs. In a prospective, long-term (5-year) follow-up study, the Edinburgh Artery Study (n = 1592 patients; 55 to 74 years old), current and recent ex\u2013cigarette smokers had a 3-fold increased risk of AAA development compared with long-time ex-smokers and never Arecent study including 404 patients with an ultrasonographically detected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) demonstrated that in patients with established ischemic heart disease (IHD) smoking is not a risk factor for the development of AAA. Although smoking was a strong independent predictor of the development of AAA in noncardiac patients (P \u2264 .0001), in patients with known cardiac disease smoking was no longer a significant predictor of aneurysmal development. These findings suggest that for patients with established IHD, smoking may not be a risk factor for the development of an AAA. We discuss these interesting findings as well as the relationship between smoking and AAA risk. The association between smoking and alterations in vascular function/structure, vascular compliance, and the development of vascular disease is well documented. Smoking is an established risk factor for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, carotid artery stenosis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and erectile dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests that smoking has a variable magnitude of increased",

        "abstract": "Signorelli et al in this issue of Angiology screened almost 3500 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 61.3 + 9.7 years) using the ankle brachial index (ABI) to detect unrecognized peripheral arterial disease (PAD). An ABI 0.9 was considered diagnostic. A total of 80 (2.3%) participants had unrecognized PAD. Of interest, among those individuals with unrecognized PAD, 5% (n 1\u20444 4) also had >75% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, whereas 12.5% (n 1\u20444 8) had an ejection fraction 30% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In multivariate analysis, an ABI 50% stenosis, whereas 2.7% had an occluded internal carotid artery. An ABI 3-fold increased risk for >50% carotid stenosis compared with individuals with an ABI >0.9 (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% CI, 1.04-10.93; P 1\u20444 .033). An ABI <0.9 in patients with asymptomatic PAD is not only a marker of generalized atherosclerosis but also a predictor of perioperative myocardial damage, should these patients undergo vascular surgery for an unrelated condition. The ABI was recorded in 627 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. In multivariate analysis, an asymptomatic ABI <0.9 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of perioperative myocardial damage (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2). Besides the ABI, several other markers/tests may reflect the presence of PAD. Examples include C-reactive protein (CRP) and functional photoplethysmograph technology using a noninvasive automated device. Both have the advantage that, unlike the ABI, they are less operator-dependent. Future studies should evaluate the prognostic significance of these variables in patients with PAD as well as their ability to identify unrecognized PAD. The identification of subclinical PAD holds implications for the timely initiation of preventive measures, namely smoking cessation, weight reduction, adoption of exercise, blood pressure and diabetes mellitus control, management of dyslipidemia, and antiplatelet treatment. Patients with PAD need to be closely monitored. The early diagnosis of PAD and the initiation of conservative measures is associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but also with several additional beneficial actions. For example, PAD is associated with the metabolic syndrome which requires treatment in its own right. Besides the management of dyslipidemia, routine statin treatment in patients with PAD is associated with an improvement in claudication, increased walking distance, and",

        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of atherosclerotic vascular disease and the incidence of infrapopliteal PAD continues to rise in the population. The historical experience with surgical and endovascular interventions for infrapopliteal stenosis was disappointing as operators experienced high rates of early technical failures and procedural complications, coupled with high rates of restenosis in this vascular territory when compared with more proximal vascular beds. While patients with infrapopliteal PAD may be asymptomatic, the majority would ultimately develop intermittent claudication or may also present with critical limb ischemia. In this article, we review the current literature, and discuss some of the technical aspects of endovascular therapy in this vascular bed. We also emphasize the importance of adjunctive evidence-based therapies such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and lifestyle modification such as smoking cessation in this particularly high-risk cohort to optimize clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate a new bioresorbable vascular scaffold for the treatment of focal tibial and distal popliteal lesions. Methods: Tibial and distal popliteal angioplasty was performed in 15 limbs of 14 patients (9 men; median age 82 years) with critical limb ischemia (CLI, n=7) or severe claudication. The 18 lesions (mean length 22.2\u00b114.0 mm) were implanted with 22 everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffolds (Absorb). Clinical and ultrasound follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to detect restenosis and evaluate safety, midterm restenosis rate, and clinical improvement. Results: Immediate technical success was 100%, although a single limb suffered 2 scaffold thromboses on the first day; it was salvaged with repeat endovascular intervention. All patients were available for surveillance examinations during a follow-up of 6.1\u00b13.9 months; no patient died. Of the 15 limbs in the analysis, clinical improvement was present in 12 (4 of 7 CLI patients); there was no amputation, bypass surgery, or evidence of binary restenosis on follow-up sonographic examination.

Methods: A single-center study prospectively enrolled 48 symptomatic patients (mean age 82.1\u00b18.0 years; 27 men) between September 2013 and February 2018 to evaluate the Absorb everolimus-eluting BVS system in distal popliteal and tibial lesions. Mean lesion length was 20.1\u00b110.8 mm. Following predilation, up to 2 BVS were implanted in target lesions in 55 limbs.

Results: Seventy-one scaffolds were implanted to treat 61 lesions. Technical success was achieved in all patients, with no amputation, death, or target limb bypass surgery within 30 days of the index procedure. There was 1 early thrombotic occlusion of 2 BVS in a previously anticoagulated patient not given antiplatelet medication after the procedure.

Atherosclerotic disease of the infra-popliteal arteries is particularly challenging to treat due to the small caliber of the vessels and the heavy burden of atherosclerotic plaque. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is the conventional first-line approach and is advantageous due to its minimal invasiveness, repeatability, and cost-effectiveness but is limited by high rates of elastic recoil, dissection, and short- to mid-term re-stenosis. Methods: This review analyses the growing body of published and presented clinical data from multiple randomised controlled trials that have investigated the role of coronary drug-eluting stents in the treatment of infrapopliteal disease. Results: Coronary drug-eluting stents demonstrate superior primary patency compared with angioplasty and/or bare metal stenting alone but are limited to application in short-segment disease and have not been widely adopted due to the nature of the permanent implant.
