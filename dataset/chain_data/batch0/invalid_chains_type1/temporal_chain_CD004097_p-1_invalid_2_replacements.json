        "abstract": "Objectives.The objective of this work was to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of a brief behavioral dietary intervention and 2 supplemental components of diabetes self-management support: telephone follow-up calls and community resources enhancement. Design and Subjects.This was a 2 \u00d7 2 randomized, controlled trial investigating the incremental effects of telephone follow-up and community resources enhancement with 320 adult type 2 diabetes outpatients. Methods.Key outcomes included behavioral (dietary patterns, fat intake), physiologic (HbA1C, lipids), and quality-of-life/patient satisfaction measures and were collected at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results.Despite high reach (76% patient participation), excellent adoption (all 12 primary care practices approached participated), and good implementation, there were few outcome differences among treatment conditions. There was significant improvement across conditions in most outcomes in each category at both follow-ups. Conclusions.A brief, computer-assisted, dietary goal\u2013setting intervention basic treatment condition was moderately successful in producing dietary improvements but less so in producing biologic or quality-of-life outcomes. Additions of follow-up phone calls or a community resources enhancement component did not produce incremental improvements over this basic intervention.",

        "abstract": "Whole grains are important dietary constituents as they provide a plethora of nutrients and protective chemicals that may have synergistic actions in promoting health. Regular consumption of wholegrain foods has been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases such as CHD and certain cancers, although their exact role in disease prevention is not yet fully elucidated. Studies reporting levels of whole grain consumption reveal that those subjects who include higher levels of whole grain foods in their diets also have many other favourable dietary and lifestyle practices. While the actions of these practices and whole grains may not be mutually exclusive, these variables do not appear to explain the reduction in risk of disease observed for high-whole grain consumers. Actual whole grain consumption levels are extremely low and many practical barriers exist to consumer uptake of these foods. Effective communication of the whole grain health message is an important strategy to increase awareness of the importance of whole grains in the diet. Increasing the variety and availability of acceptable wholegrain foods is also important. Whole grain consumption at breakfast can have an important impact on total daily nutrient intakes. This simple dietary modification is potentially relatively easy to achieve and could greatly contribute to increased whole grain intake for many individuals.",

        "abstract": "The continued emphasis on the importance of dietary fibers to the Western diet and the need for products with a lower calorific content is pressuring food companies to allocate more resources to the development of fiber-enriched products. The challenge to the industry is to accomplish this goal without sacrificing the organoleptic appeal of some of their core offerings. As future research details specific nutritional benefits of individual components of dietary fiber, food companies will need flexible alternatives in order to validate new 'functional' food claims and to respond rapidly to emerging trends in fiber-enriched products. These objectives will be achieved by understanding the physicochemical basis for the biotechnical functionality of fibers and by developing, and making available fibers which provide a broad spectrum of bioactive and texture modulating properties.",

        "abstract": "Alkylresorcinols with alkyl chains C17:0-C25:0 are abundant in whole-grain wheat and rye. Concentrations in human plasma have been suggested to be biomarkers of dietary whole-grain intake. We measured human plasma, erythrocyte, and lipoprotein alkylresorcinol concentrations and alkylresorcinol homolog distribution, and evaluated the use of plasma alkylresorcinol concentration as a dietary biomarker of whole-grain intake compared with serum enterolactone. A total of 15 subjects (8 women) consumed whole-grain wheat or whole-grain rye crisp bread ( approximately 100 g/d) in a crossover design for 1 wk. The test bread periods were preceded by 1-wk periods of consuming refined wheat bread. Plasma, erythrocyte, lipoprotein alkylresorcinol, and serum enterolactone concentrations were measured before and after each period, and plasma alkylresorcinols and serum enterolactone were measured after habitual diet intake before and 1 wk after the trial. Plasma alkylresorcinols are transported in lipoproteins with VLDL and HDL being the main carriers. AR concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, and lipoproteins were increased (P < 0.05) by whole-grain wheat bread and even more so with rye crisp bread, although interindividual variation was high. The alkylresorcinol homolog C17:0 to C21:0 ratio in plasma was higher after the whole-grain rye diet period compared with the whole-grain wheat diet period (P < 0.05). Serum enterolactone concentrations were increased significantly by whole-grain rye intake only in men. This is the first report to show that alkylresorcinols in human plasma are mainly transported in lipoproteins. The plasma alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 ratio reflects intake of whole-grain wheat and rye, and the plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration appears to be a useful biomarker of whole-grain cereal intake.",

        "abstract": "Biomarkers of dietary intake are prominent tools in nutritional research. The alkylresorcinol metabolites 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (3,5-DHPPA) have been proposed as exposure biomarkers of whole-grain (WG) wheat and rye intake. However, the profile of alkylresorcinol metabolites is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of alkylresorcinols in mice and in humans, while further determining urinary pharmacokinetics of the novel alkylresorcinol metabolites to explore their potential as biomarkers of WG wheat intake. Utilization of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach resulted in 10 alkylresorcinol metabolites identified in mice and in humans, including 3 phenolic acids and 7 of their phase II conjugates. Among them, 2 novel metabolites were discovered: 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (3,5-DHPPTA) and 2-(3,5-dihydroxybenzamido)acetic acid (3,5-DHBA glycine). The structures of these 2 metabolites were confirmed by comparing with authentic standards synthesized in-house. In the pharmacokinetic study, a group of 12 volunteers consumed a polyphenolic-restricted diet for 4 d before ingesting WG wheat bread containing 61 mg of alkylresorcinols. Urine samples were collected for 32 h, and alkylresorcinol metabolites were quantified with HPLC-coulometric electrode array detection. The mean urinary excretion rates and mean apparent half-life of 3,5-DHPPTA, 3,5-DHBA glycine, 3,5-DHBA, and 3,5-DHPPA at each time point were determined. Our results suggest that 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine may be used in combination with 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHPPA as potential biomarkers to increase the accuracy of recording WG wheat and rye intake in epidemiologic studies. Further validation of 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine as potential biomarkers is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Background: In order to attenuate the measurement error inherent in dietary recall methods, alkylresorcinols (ARs) have been proposed as a biomarker of whole-grain (WG) intake (1, 2). Although ARs have shown promise in experimental (3) and observational studies (4), most of this research has been conducted in Nordic populations that consume relatively high amounts of WG (5). Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess the utility of plasma AR concentration as a WG intake biomarker and identify the primary dietary and nondietary determinants of plasma AR concentration in a population that consumes relatively few WG. Methods: This ancillary study used data from first-year college students (n=122) who completed three interviewer-administered 24-hour recalls and had two fasting venous blood draws performed on non-consecutive days. Dietary data was compiled using the Nutrition Data System for Research (6). Blood lipids and glucose were determined via enzymatic assay and plasma AR concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7). Correlation coefficients (rs) were calculated between plasma AR concentrations and dietary intake variables and cardiometabolic risk factors. One-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test were used to assess group differences across plasma AR quartiles. Determinants of plasma AR concentration were assessed using multiple regression models. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.2.3. Results: Plasma AR concentration was significantly positively correlated with WG intake (rs = 0.24, p <0.01). The correlation was stronger in males (n=36, rs = 0.33, p < 0.05) than females (n=86, rs = 0.18, p = 0.08). One-way ANOVA across plasma AR quartiles was significant for fiber intake [F(3,118) = 8.58, p < 0.001] and Tukey\u2019s HSD test showed that the mean daily fiber intake for the highest AR quartile was significantly greater than for the lowest (M = 20.2 \u00b1 1.9 g, 14.7 \u00b1 1.4 g respectively). The only cardiometabolic risk factor that was significantly associated with plasma AR concentration was triglycerides (rs = 0.27, p < 0.01). Multiple regression models including log-transformed dietary variables showed that WG bread was the only significant food-item predictor of plasma AR concentration (\u03b2 = 0.54, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Although plasma AR concentration was significantly associated with WG and fiber intake, triglycerides were the primary determinant and the relationships were not strong enough to produce accurate WG intake prediction models. More research is needed on the use of AR as a quantitative biomarker in low WGconsuming populations.",
