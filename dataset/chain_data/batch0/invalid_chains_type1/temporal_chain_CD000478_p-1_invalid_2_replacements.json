        "title": "Azathioprine versus sulfasalazine in maintenance of remission in severe ulcerative colitis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAzathioprine is useful as a steroid-sparing drug in patients with ulcerative colitis. Its role as monotherapy in the maintenance of disease remission has not been evaluated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this prospective, randomized, open-label study, 25 patients with severe ulcerative colitis received either azathioprine (2.5 mg/Kg/day; Group A, n = 12) or sulfasalazine (6 g/day; Group B, n = 13). All patients received oral corticosteroids in a tapering dosage schedule initially. Treatment failure was defined as either disease relapse or drug withdrawal because of adverse effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive of 12 patients in Group A and 8 of 13 patients in Group B had sustained remission during the stipulated study period of 18 months (p = ns). Two patients in Group A had to stop azathioprine because of adverse effects (bone marrow suppression and acute pancreatitis). In Group A, all patients who had treatment failure developed it in the first half of the study while in Group B treatment failure occurred in both halves.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe relapse rate of ulcerative colitis on maintenance therapy with azathioprine or sulfasalazine is comparable; there was a trend towards earlier treatment failure with azathioprine.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nTo evaluate the role of azathioprine (AZA) in Indian patients with ulcerative colitis over longer duration of time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred fifty six patients with ulcerative colitis who were treated with AZA from January 1995 to December 2003 were reviewed. The indications for its use were as follows: (1) steroid dependent and steroid refractory disease; (2) Azathioprine monotherapy for naive patients with severe disease; and (3) combination therapy (AZA + sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates) for naive patients with severe disease. The data included patient and disease demographics, efficacy and toxicity profile of AZA. Patients with a minimum duration of 6 mo use of AZA were included in this report.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf a total of 156 patients treated with AZA, 45 were excluded from analysis for the following reasons- (follow up less than 6 mo, n = 9; poor follow up, n = 18; adverse affects, n = 18). In steroid refractory/dependent group the mean number of relapses prior to and post initiation of AZA therapy were 3.28 (+/- 0.81) and 0.94 (+/- 0.29) respectively. Discontinuation of steroids could be accomplished in 12 of the 15 steroid dependent patients. The proportion of patients with sustained remission of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years duration were calculated. Eighteen patients experienced adverse effects necessitating withdrawal of AZA (pancreatitis, n = 7; hepatitis, n = 3; gastrointestinal intolerance, n = 2; alopecia, n = 2; and hematological, n = 4) while 13 patients needed dose reduction or temporary withdrawal of the drug.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAzathioprine is well tolerated and has therapeutic benefits lasting as long as 4 years. Adverse effects such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, cytopenias and gastrointestinal symptoms do occur but are controlled by drug withdrawal only.",

        "title": "Inflammation Driven by Overexpression of the Hypoglycosylated Abnormal Mucin 1 (MUC1) Links Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pancreatitis",
        "abstract": "Objective: Pancreatitis occurs as an extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the cause is poorly understood. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is overexpressed in an abnormal, hypoglycosylated form on the colonic epithelium in human IBD where it contributes to inflammation. MUC1 is also expressed on pancreatic ductal epithelia. We tested the possibility that in IBD, MUC1 expression on pancreatic ducts is also abnormal leading to inflammation and pancreatitis. Methods: We used MUC1+/interleukin-10\u2212/\u2212 mice that develop IBD. We imaged abnormal MUC1 expression in these mice by adoptively transferring T cells from T cell receptor transgenic mice specific for abnormal MUC1. Cells were labeled with a novel perfluorocarbon tracer reagent and quantified and visualized in vivo using high-throughput 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: MUC1-specific T cells migrated to the colon in mice with IBD and also to the pancreas. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased expression on the pancreatic ducts of the abnormal MUC1 seen in the colon and the presence of cellular infiltrate. Conclusions: Migration of MUC1-specific T cells to the colon and the pancreas in diseased mice suggests that pancreatitis is an extraintestinal site of IBD, characterized by proinflammatory abnormal expression of MUC1. Therapies directed against abnormal MUC1 have the potential of targeting the disease in both sites.",

        "title": "The membrane-bound mucin Muc1 regulates T helper 17-cell responses and colitis in mice.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nT helper (Th) 17 cells produce the effector cytokine interleukin (IL)-17, along with IL-22, which stimulates colonic epithelial cells to produce a membrane-bound mucin, Muc1. Muc1 is a component of the colonic mucus, which functions as a lubricant and a physiologic barrier between luminal contents and mucosal surface. The gene MUC1 has been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease; we investigated the role of Muc1 in development of colitis in mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMuc1 and RAG1 were disrupted in mice (Muc/RAG double knockout mice); Th1-mediated colitis was induced by intravenous injection of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells. We also studied Th2-mediated colitis using mice with disruptions in Muc1 and T-cell receptor \u03b1 chain (Muc/TCR double knockout mice).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMuc1 deficiency led to the development of more severe forms of Th1- and Th2-induced colitis than controls. Loss of Muc1 increased colonic permeability and the Th17-cell, but not Th2 or Th1 cell, response in the inflamed colon. Loss of Muc1 also promoted expansion of an innate lymphoid cell population (Lin(-) ckit(-) Thy1(+) Sca1(+)) that produces IL-17. The expansion of Th17 adaptive immune cells and innate lymphoid cells required the commensal microbiota.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMuc1, which is up-regulated by Th17 signaling, functions in a negative feedback pathway that prevents an excessive Th17 cell response in inflamed colons of mice. Disruption of this negative feedback pathway, perhaps by variants in Muc1, might contribute to inflammatory bowel disease in patients.",

        "title": "Downregulation of Hematopoietic MUC1 during Experimental Colitis Increases Tumor-Promoting Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells",
        "abstract": "Purpose: MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen that is aberrantly expressed in cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Even though immune cells express low MUC1 levels, their modulations of MUC1 are important in tumor progression. Consistent with previous clinical data that show increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in IBD, we now show that downregulation of MUC1 on hematopoietic cells increases MDSCs in IBD, similar to our data in tumor-bearing mice. We hypothesize that MDSC expansion in IBD is critical for tumor progression. Experimental Design: To mechanistically confirm the linkage between Muc1 downregulation and MDSC expansion, we generated chimeric mice that did not express Muc1 in the hematopoietic compartment (KO\u2192WT). These mice were used in two models of colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and their responses were compared with wild-type (WT) chimeras (WT\u2192WT). Results: KO\u2192WT mice show increased levels of MDSCs during colitis and increased protumorigenic signaling in the colon during CAC, resulting in larger colon tumors. RNA and protein analysis show increased upregulation of metalloproteinases, collagenases, defensins, complements, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines in KO\u2192WT mice as compared with WT\u2192WT mice. Antibody-mediated depletion of MDSCs in mice during colitis reduced colon tumor formation during CAC. Conclusion: Development of CAC is a serious complication of colitis and our data highlight MDSCs as a targetable link between inflammation and cancer. In addition, the lack of MUC1 expression on MDSCs can be a novel marker for MDSCs, given that MDSCs are still not well characterized in human cancers.

        "abstract": "Chronic inflammation contributes to cancer development via multiple mechanisms. One potential mechanism is that chronic inflammation can generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment that allows advantages for tumor formation and progression. The immunosuppressive environment in certain chronic inflammatory diseases and solid cancers is characterized by accumulation of proinflammatory mediators, infiltration of immune suppressor cells and activation of immune checkpoint pathways in effector T cells. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of how immunosuppression contributes to cancer and how proinflammatory mediators induce the immunosuppressive microenvironment via induction of immunosuppressive cells and activation of immune checkpoint pathways.",

        "abstract": "Abnormally O-glycosylated MUC1 tandem repeat glycopeptide epitopes expressed by multiple types of cancer have long been attractive targets for therapy in the race against genetic mutations of tumor cells. Glycopeptide signature-guided therapy might be a more promising avenue than mutation signature-guided therapy. Three O-glycosylated peptide motifs, PDTR, GSTA, and GVTS, exist in a tandem repeat HGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA, containing five O-glycosylation sites. The exact peptide and sugar residues involved in antibody binding are poorly defined. Co-crystal structures of glycopeptides and respective monoclonal antibodies are very few. Here we review 3 groups of monoclonal antibodies: antibodies which only bind to peptide portion, antibodies which only bind to sugar portion, and antibodies which bind to both peptide and sugar portions. The antigenicity of peptide and sugar portions of glyco-MUC1 tandem repeat were analyzed according to available biochemical and structural data, especially the GSTA and GVTS motifs independent from the most studied PDTR. Tn is focused as a peptide-modifying residue in vaccine design, to induce glycopeptide-binding antibodies with cross reactivity to Tn-related tumor glycans, but not glycans of healthy cells. The unique requirement for the designs of antibody in antibody-drug conjugate, bi-specific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "MUC1 is a membrane glycoprotein, which in adenocarninomas is overexpressed and exhibits truncated O\u2010glycosylation. Overexpression and altered glycosylation make MUC1 into a candidate for immunotherapy.

Glycosylation with tumor carbohydrate antigens such as the Tn\u2010antigen (GalNAc\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr) results in antibodies binding with higher affinity. One proposed model to explain the enhanced affinity of antibodies for the glycosylated antigen is that the addition of a carbohydrate alters the conformational properties, favoring a binding\u2010competent state. The conformational effects associated with Tn glycosylation of the MUC1 antigen was investigated using solution\u2010state NMR and molecular dynamics. NMR experiments revealed distinct substructures of the glycosylated MUC1 peptides compared with the unglycosylated peptide.
