        "abstract": "The effects of ovarian suppression by oral contraceptives as well as hormone replacement therapy were studied on hormone levels and on products of hormone action in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) from breasts of pre- and postmenopausal women. Multiple samples per subject revealed high consistency (intraclass correlation coefficients) for all products measured. Compared with premenopausal women, NAF progesterone was much lower in postmenopausal women, but NAF androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations were not different. With oral contraceptive use, estradiol, estrone sulfate, and progesterone levels were similarly lower in serum and NAF. In postmenopausal women, NAF estradiol and estrone sulfate were not significantly less than those in premenopausal women, nor were epidermal growth factor or cathepsin D levels, but IL-6 was elevated. Despite corresponding changes in hormones in serum and NAF over time, correlations based on simultaneous sampling were not significant. It is concluded that: 1) potential precursors of estradiol remain at comparable levels in the breast after menopause; 2) local synthesis is important for maintenance of estradiol levels in NAF of postmenopausal women but less important for progesterone; and 3) changes in the serum parameters are accurately reflected in NAF, but only after a matter of days. These findings provide additional validation for the physiological relevance of NAF hormone levels as potential breast cancer risk markers.",

        "title": "Diabetes and risk of breast cancer in Asian-American women.",
        "abstract": "The role of diabetes in the etiology of breast cancer in Asian-Americans is not known. We investigated the relation between diabetes and breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Los Angeles County that included 1248 Asian-American women with incident, histologically confirmed breast cancer and 1148 control women, who were frequency matched to cases on age, Asian ethnicity and neighborhood of residence. The relation between history of diabetes and serum concentrations of estrogens, androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was investigated in 212 post-menopausal control women. A history of diabetes was statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.68, 95% confidence interval = 1.15-2.47] after adjusting for reproductive and other factors. This increased risk was unchanged after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). We found a stronger diabetes-breast cancer association in women with lower BMI (< or = 22.7) (adjusted OR = 3.50, P = 0.011) than those with higher BMI (>22.7) (adjusted OR = 1.39, P = 0.23) but this difference in ORs was not statistically significant. Our results also show that the diabetes-breast cancer association was observed only in low/intermediate soy consumers (OR = 2.48, P = 0.0008) but not among high soy consumers (OR = 0.75, P = 0.41) (P interaction = 0.014). Controls who were diabetic showed significantly lower SHBG (20%) (P = 0.02) but higher free testosterone levels (26%) (P = 0.08) than women without such a history after adjusting for BMI and WHR. Our results support the hypothesis that diabetes may have a role in the development of breast cancer, influencing risk via both sex hormone and insulin pathways.",

        "title": "Dietary phytoestrogens are not associated with risk of overall breast cancer but diets rich in coumestrol are inversely associated with risk of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative breast tumors in Swedish women.",
        "abstract": "Results from epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that phytoestrogens may protect against breast cancer. Because one of the biological effects of phytoestrogens is probably estrogenic, it's possible that the preventive effect on breast cancer differs by estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor. We evaluated the associations between dietary phytoestrogen (isoflavonoids, lignans, and coumestrol) intake and risk of breast cancer and whether the ER/PR statuses of the tumor influence this relationship. In 1991-2 a prospective population-based cohort study among Swedish pre- and postmenopausal women was performed, making questionnaire data available for 45,448 women. A total of 1014 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed until December 2004. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to estimate multivariate risk ratios, 95% CI for associations with risk of breast cancer. Intakes of lignan, isoflavonoid, or coumestrol were not associated with breast cancer risk overall or before or after 50 y of age. The effects of lignans or isoflavonoids were independent of receptor status. However, intake of coumestrol was associated with decreased risk of receptor negative tumors (ER-PR-) but not positive tumors. The risk of ER-PR- tumors was significantly lower (50%) in women with intermediate coumestrol intake compared with those who did not consume any. In conclusion, we found no association between intake of isoflavonoids or lignans and breast cancer risk. Our results of a decreased risk of ER-PR- tumors in women with intermediate intake of coumestrol could be due to chance because of the low intake. The results should be confirmed in other studies.",

We calculated pooled risk estimates (REs) for total lignan exposure, dietary lignan intake, enterolignan exposure, and blood or urine concentrations of enterolactone and according to menopausal and estrogen receptor (ER) status of tumors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 21 studies (11 prospective cohort studies and 10 case-control studies) in the meta-analyses. Lignan exposure was not associated with an overall breast cancer risk (RE: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.02; P for heterogeneity = 0.004). However, in postmenopausal women, high lignan intake was associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer (13 studies; RE: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.94; P for heterogeneity = 0.32). Breast cancer risk was also inversely associated with enterolignan exposure (4 studies; RE: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) but not with blood or urine enterolactone concentrations. The associations were not significantly different between ER-status subgroups (6 studies).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh lignan exposure may be associated with a reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Additional work is warranted to clarify the association between lignan exposure and breast cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nLignans--plant-derived compounds with estrogen-dependent and -independent anticarcinogenic properties--have been associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but data are limited regarding their effect on survival. Dietary lignans are metabolized to enterolignans, which are subsequently absorbed and become bioavailable.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe assessed the prognosis of 1,140 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer age 50 to 74 years who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2005. Vital status through the end of 2009 was ascertained via local population registries, and deaths were verified by death certificates. Information on recurrences and secondary tumors was verified by clinical records and attending physicians. Associations of postdiagnostic serum enterolactone (a biomarker for dietary lignans) with overall survival and distant disease-free survival were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian enterolactone levels for deceased patients and those still alive were 17.0 and 21.4 nmol/L, respectively. During a median of 6.1 years of follow-up after diagnosis, 162 deaths were confirmed. Higher serum enterolactone levels were associated with significantly reduced hazard ratios (HRs) for death (HR per 10 nmol/L increment, 0.94; P = .04; HR for the highest quartile, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.99). For distant disease, HR was 0.94 per 10 nmol/L increment (P = .08) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.09) for the highest quartile. The highest quartile of serum enterolactone was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death only for estrogen receptor-negative tumors (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.87) but not for estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.84: P for heterogeneity = .09).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPostmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have high serum enterolactone levels may have better survival.",

        "abstract": "There were no clinically relevant changes in the AGO recommendations concerning breast cancer risk and prevention compared to 2011. On the other hand, there were some important publications stimulating further investigations. In 2010, RAD51C was identified as the 3rd high-risk gene for breast and ovarian cancer, which is, however, rarely mutated [124]. RAD51C constitutes a proof of concept for the existence of more, yet very rarely affected high-risk genes. Recently, it was further shown by Loveday et al. [117] that germline mutations in RAD51D may confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors impair base excision repair during mitosis [26, 67].

        "abstract": "Nontransformed breast epithelial cells that are adjacent to tumor cells are constantly exposed to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), two inflammatory cytokines identified as having pro-tumoral causative roles. We show that continuous stimulation of nontransformed breast epithelial cells by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 for 2 to 3 weeks induced their spreading and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanistic bases for this slow induction of EMT by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 are: 1) it took 2 to 3 weeks for the cytokines to induce the expression of the EMT activators Zeb1 and Snail; 2) although Twist has amplified the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail, its expression was reduced by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2; however, the lack of Twist was compensated by prolonged stimulation with TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 that has potentiated the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail. Stimulation by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 has induced the following dissemination-related properties in the nontransformed cells: 1) up-regulation of functional matrix metalloproteinases; 2) induction of migratory and invasive capabilities; 3) disruption of the normal phenotype of organized three-dimensional acini structures typically formed only by nontransformed breast cells and spreading of nontransformed cells out of such acini. Our findings suggest that TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 induce dissemination of nontransformed breast epithelial cells and their reseeding at the primary tumor site; if, then, such detached cells are exposed to transforming events, they may form secondary malignant focus and lead to disease recurrence. Thus, our study reveals novel pathways through which the inflammatory microenvironment may contribute to relapsed disease in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Lamellarin D (LamD) is a marine alkaloid with a pronounced cytotoxicity against a large panel of cancer cells, affecting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of this compound are poorly understood. In this study, the anticancer efficacy of LamD was investigated in human leukemia K562 cells. The results showed suppressed cell proliferation and induction of G0/G1-phase arrest,while expression of CDK1, and activity of smad3 and smad5 were reduced, but that of p27, p53 and STGC3 was increased. LamD induced cell apoptosis through activation of caspases-8/-3, inhibition of survivin and Bcl-2, suggesting that this compound may also act through a caspase-independent pathway. Moreover, LamD inhibited the secretion of TGF-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and other inflammatory cytokines and the transcriptional activity of transcription factor NF-\u03baB in human leukemia K562 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that LamD-mediated inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation may be related to the induction of apoptosis and the regulation of cell cycle, tumor- related gene expression and cytokine expression, which may provide a new way of thinking for the treatment leukemia.",

        "abstract": "Limited oxygen availability plays a critical role in the malignant progression of breast cancer by orchestrating a complex modulation of the gene transcription largely dependent on the tumor phenotype. Invasive breast tumors belonging to different molecular subtypes are characterized by over\u2010expression of PLC\u2010\u03b22, whose amount positively correlates with the malignant evolution of breast neoplasia and supports the invasive potential of breast tumor cells. Here we report that hypoxia modulates the expression of PLC\u2010\u03b22 in breast tumor cells in a phenotype\u2010related manner, since a decrease of the protein was observed in the BT\u2010474 and MCF7 cell lines while an increase was revealed in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells as a consequence of low oxygen availability. Under hypoxia, the down\u2010modulation of PLC\u2010\u03b22 was mainly correlated with the decrease of the EMT marker E\u2010cadherin in the BT\u2010474 cells and with the up\u2010regulation of the stem cell marker CD133 in MCF7 cells. The increase of PLC\u2010\u03b22 induced by low oxygen in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells supports the hypoxia\u2010related reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and sustains invasion capability. In all examined cell lines, but with an opposite role in the ER\u2010positive and ER\u2010negative cells, PLC\u2010\u03b22 was involved in the hypoxia\u2010induced increase of HIF\u20101\u03b1, known to affect both EMT and CD133 expression. Our data include PLC\u2010\u03b22 in the complex and interconnected signaling pathways induced by low oxygen availability in breast tumor cells and suggest that the forced modulation of PLC\u2010\u03b22 programmed on the basis of tumor phenotype may prevent the malignant progression of breast neoplasia as a consequence of intra\u2010tumoral hypoxia. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Specifically, ecto\u2010 and cytoplasmic domains are responsible for the interaction with extracellular matrix molecules and intracellular kinases, respectively. These interactions indicate syndecans as key molecules during cancer initiation and progression. Particularly syndecans interact with other cell surface receptors, such as growth factor receptors and integrins, which lead to activation of downstream signaling pathways, which are critical for the cellular behavior. Moreover, this review describes the key role of syndecans in intracellular calcium regulation and homeostasis. The syndecan\u2010mediated regulation of calcium metabolism is highly correlated with cells\u2019 adhesion phenotype through the actin cytoskeleton and formation of junctions, with implications during differentiation and disease progression.",

The GAG building blocks of PGs significantly influence the chemical and functional properties of PGs. The primary goal of this comprehensive review is to summarize major achievements and paradigm-shifting discoveries made on the PG/GAG chemistry-biology axis, focusing on structural variability, structure-function relationships, metabolic, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying their synthesis. Recent insights related to exosome biogenesis, degradation, and cell signaling, their status as diagnostic tools and potential pharmacological targets in diseases as well as current applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology are addressed.
