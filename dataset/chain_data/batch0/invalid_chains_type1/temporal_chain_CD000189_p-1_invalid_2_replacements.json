        "title": "Ibuprofen in rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical study of analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.",
        "abstract": "Ibuprofen (2-4'-isobutylphenylpropionic acid) is one of a series of phenylalkanoic acids which have been found to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. The first of these to be successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was Ibufenac (isobutylphenylacetic acid) (Chalmers, 1963; Thompson, Stephenson, and Percy, 1964; Hart and Boardman, 1965) and the most recent of the series is Ibuprofen. Pharmacological studies have shown that the compound is between two to eight times more potent than aspirin (Adams, Cliffe, Lessel, and Nicholson, 1967). In this paper we report a double-blind cross-over study of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis of a daily dose of 750 mg. Ibuprofen compared with aspirin 5g./day and prednisolone 15 mg./day; each drug being administered orally for a period of one week.",

        "abstract": "SummaryA double-blind single-dose comparison was performed comparing the analgesic effects of ibuprofen (\u2018Brufen\u2019) 400\u2009mg. and dextropropoxyphene 65\u2009mg. The women who were admitted to the trial were those who, following full-term vaginal delivery, required an analgesic agent for control of their pain. Pain relief was measured, half hourly for two hours, then hourly for the next ten hours, on a five point scale ranging from no relief to complete relief of pain. \u2020 \u2018Brufen\u2019 is the Boots trade name for ibuprofen.Statistical analysis of the results using the Mann-Whitney U Test showed the analgesic effect of ibuprofen to be superior to that of dextropropoxyphene at the one hour, one and a half hour, four hour and five hour recordings at the 5% level of probability, and over the total 12 hour period at the 0.1% level of probability.Side-effects were noted in only one case, this being a patient who had an allergic-like response to ibuprofen.",

        "title": "Ibuprofen versus placebo in the relief of post-episiotomy pain.",
        "abstract": "Thirty post-partum patients, aged 19 to 37 years, were treated for episiotomy pain and inflammation with either 1600 mg ibuprofen (400 mg every 6 hours) or placebo daily for 7 days in a completely randomized, double-blind study. Pain intensity, movement restriction and extent of swelling in the episiotomy were recorded prior to treatment and at intervals of 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. The difference scores of pain intensity, movement restriction and extent of swelling were calculated from the differences between pretreatment and post-treatment values. By all methods of evaluation, ibuprofen was significantly more effective than placebo at 1 and 3 days after the initiation of the treatment. Only 2 minor side-effects were recorded, both in the placebo group.",

Treatment was either 100mcg f1unisolide (two sprays in each nostril) or 60mg terfenadine (one tablet), twice daily. Treatment started before the anticipated start of the pollen season and continued for seven weeks. Assessment of symptom severity was conducted at admission and after three and seven weeks' treatment. Overall effect of treatment was evaluated and any side-effects were record-ed. Patients also kept a daily record of symptom severity.",

        "title": "The Effect of Serum Physiological and Rivanol on the Process of Recovery During Episiotomy Care",
        "abstract": "Objectives: Episiotomy is frequently performed in primigravidas in many hospitals. No standard application exists in episiotomy care. This study aimed to compare the effect of serum physiological (SP) and rivanol on the process of recovery and perineal pain during episiotomy care. Patients and Methods: The study was conducted with 60 primiparous women. During the process of data collection, rivanol was used for episiotomy care of the first 30 mothers who met the inclusion criteria (Group 1). Serum physiological was used in Group 2. The first data were collected in the first four hours of the postpartum in the hospital. Mothers were invited to the hospital for the evaluations on 7th, 14th, and 21st days. Episiotomy wound was evaluated with REEDA score and pain with Visual Analog Scale. Results: In episiotomy healing process, there was a difference between groups in favor of SP according to total scores of REEDA on the 7th, 14th and 21st days. There was a difference in SP group with respect to pain on the 21st day. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, SP was found to be more effective than rivanol in episiotomy healing. Therefore, the use of SP, which is non-chemical and has no side effects to the healing process, is suggested in episiotomy care. Amac: Epizyotomi, bircok hastanede primigravidalarda siklikla uygulanmaktadir. Epizyotomi bakiminda standart bir uygulama yoktur. Bu calisma ile serum fizyolojik (SF) ve rivanolun epizyotominin iyilesme sureci ve perine agrisi uzerindeki etkisinin karsilastirilmasi amaclandi. Hastalar ve Yontemler: Bu calisma vajinal dogum yapan 60 primipar uzerinde yapildi. Veri toplama surecinde katilim kosullarina uygun, ilk 30 annenin epizyotomi bakiminda rivanol kullanildi (Grup 1). Grup 2a#39;de ise SF kullanildi. Ilk veriler postpartum ilk dort saat icinde hastanede toplandi. 7., 14., 21. gunlerdeki degerlendirmeler icin anneler hastaneye davet edildi. Epizyotomi yarasi REEDA skoru ile, agri ise Gorsel Analog Skala ile degerlendirildi. Bulgular: Epizyotomi iyilesme surecinde Iki grup arasinda toplam REEDA skoru yonunden 7., 14. ve 21. gunlerde SF lehine fark saptandi. Agri bakimindan 21. gunde SF grubunda fark saptandi. Sonuc: Bu calismanin sonuclarina gore epizyotomi yarasinin iyilesmesinde SF rivanolden daha etkili bulunmustur. Bu sebeple epizyotomi bakiminda yara iyilesme surecine yan etkisi bulunmayan ve bir kimyasal olmayan SF kullanimi onerilir.",
