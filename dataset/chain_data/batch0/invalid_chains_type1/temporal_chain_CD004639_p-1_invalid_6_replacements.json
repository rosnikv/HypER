        "title": "Calcium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension: Assessment by office, home and ambulatory blood pressure",
        "abstract": "Objective To study the effects of a high calcium intake in hypertensive patients by blood pressure monitoring. Design In a randomized crossover study, patients were assigned to an 8-week calcium supplementation period and an 8-week control period. The subjects were given 25 mmol/day (1 g/day) of calcium as calcium carbonate during the intervention period. Setting A hypertension clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients Sixty untreated or treated hypertensive patients (35 men and 25 women, mean age 58 years) with office systolic/diastolic blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mmHg. Main outcome measures Office blood pressure, home blood pressure (last 7 days), and ambulatory 24 h blood pressure (every 30 min using TM-2421). Results The serum calcium concentration and urinary calcium excretion increased significantly with calcium supplementation. Office, home and 24 h blood pressure were lower in the calcium period than in the control period, although the differences were small (mean \u00b1 SEM office blood pressure: 1.2 \u00b1 1.2/1.1 \u00b1 0.7 mmHg; home blood pressure: 1.9 \u00b1 0.7/1.3 \u00b1 0.6 mmHg; 24 h blood pressure: 1.2 \u00b1 0.8/0.9 \u00b1 0.5 mmHg,), and significant only for home systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The difference in home systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with the level of home blood pressure in the control period and with the difference in urinary calcium. The difference in 24 h systolic blood pressure was positively correlated with the control level of urinary calcium. Age, sex, antihypertensive medication, drinking habit, sodium intake or order of treatment did not significantly influence the effects of calcium supplementation. Conclusions An increase in calcium intake tends to lower office, home and ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients. However, the antihypertensive effect is too small to support the general application of a high calcium intake in the treatment of hypertension.",

        "title": "Role of blood pressure monitoring in non-pharmacological management of hypertension",
        "abstract": "Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure (BP) measurement appear to be useful in the assessment of the effects of non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension because they can detect small changes in BP without observer bias. We studied the effects of various lifestyle modifications using ABPM and home BP measurement in Japanese patients with hypertension. Weight reduction by a hypocaloric diet (average 4\u2009kg) was associated with decreases in 24-h BP (10/4\u2009mmHg) as well as casual BP (9/6\u2009mmHg). The reductions in daytime and night-time BPs were comparable. The effects of daily walking without weight loss on office, home, and 24-h BPs were 2\u20133/1\u20132\u2009mmHg. The changes in home and 24-h BPs were more significant than those in office BP. A low-salt diet (25\u2009mmol/day versus 250\u2009mmol/day) decreased 24-h BP by 9/4\u2009mmHg. This hypotensive effect was observed throughout the day. Potassium supplementation (64\u2009mmol/day) decreased office, home and 24-h BPs by 3\u20134/1\u20132\u2009mmHg. The changes in home and 24-h BPs were highly significant compared with office BP. Supplementation of magnesium (20\u2009mmol/day) also reduced those BPs significantly. However, the effects of calcium supplementation (25\u2009mmol/day) were small (1\u20132/1\u2009mmHg) and were significant only for home BP. Alcohol restriction for 4 weeks decreased daytime BP by 3/2\u2009mmHg but increased night-time BP by 4/2\u2009mmHg. Average 24-h BP did not change. Smoking cessation lowered daytime BP without affecting night-time BP. Monitoring of 24-h BP and home BP can detect small changes in BP produced by lifestyle modifications. Ambulatory BP monitoring is particularly suitable in the assessment of changes in lifestyle affecting the circadian pattern of BP such as alcohol consumption and smoking.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDietary factors directly influence blood pressure (BP). The lactotripeptides (LTPs) IPP (isoleucine-proline-proline) and VPP (valine-proline-proline), formed by hydrolyzing dairy proteins, and potassium, a mineral mainly found in fruit, vegetables, and dairy products, are extensively studied for their BP-lowering effect. The efficacy of LTPs seems modest in whites compared with that in Asians.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective was to study the effects of enzymatically produced LTPs alone or in combination with potassium on ambulatory BP in whites.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwo multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover studies were conducted; each consisted of two 4-wk intervention periods separated by a 4-wk washout period. In study 1, 69 subjects received 200 g/d of a dairy drink with 5.8 mg IPP and 4.4 mg VPP or placebo. In study 2, 93 subjects received 100 g/d of a dairy drink with 2.7 mg IPP, 1.9 mg VPP, and 350 mg added K or placebo. The subjects were randomly assigned according to their daytime ambulatory BP.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean 24-h systolic and diastolic BP (baseline values-study 1: 137.1/81.6 mm Hg; study 2: 139.2/80.9 mm Hg) remained similar with no significant differences between treatments in either study (P > 0.10). Office BP decreased over the course of both studies (systolic BP > 5 mm Hg), but differences between interventions were not significant (P > 0.10). In both studies, nighttime BP dipped during all treatments (> or =15%) but was statistically more significant with placebo (P < 0.05). Sodium excretion increased significantly after consumption of LTPs and potassium compared with after placebo intervention (P = 0.01), but not after consumption of LTPs alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe data do not support a BP-lowering effect of LTPs in whites.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for omega-3 containing fish oils. By-products from fish fillet production can be utilized for the production of fish oils and be a valuable source of omega-3 for human consumption. The aim of this work was to evaluate industrial processes for production of quality oil for human consumption made from Norwegian spring spawning herring by-products. A mobile production plant was used to compare two industrial processes, thermal treatment (wet rendering) and enzymatic protein hydrolysis, for production of oil from herring by-products immediately after filleting. Results show that high quality herring oil can be produced from fresh by-products. The use of by-products immediately after filleting resulted in a low amount of free fatty acids for all the produced oils (below 0.4%). Thermal treatment at 70\u00b0C resulted in an oil with lower oxidation status and higher stability compared to the oils produced by enzymatic protein hydrolysis. Nevertheless, both processing methods gave a crude oil of high quality compared to crude oils on the market.",

        "abstract": "Renin catalyzes the rate-determining step in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates mammalian blood pressure by converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). Excessive plasma levels of Ang I is a causative factor in hypertension development. Therefore, inhibition of renin activity can lower blood pressure and provide relief from clinical symptoms associated with hypertension. Synthetic compounds are currently the most used group of renin inhibitors; however, only aliskiren is approved as a drug for hypertension treatment. But some negative side effects are associated with aliskiren therapy, which have necessitated the search for alternative natural compounds such as food protein-derived renin-inhibitory peptides with blood pressure-reducing effects. This paper is a concise review of the currently known sources and methods of production of renin-inhibitory peptides including their potential in vitro and in vivo extent of renin inhibition. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Hypertension is a major human chronic disease that leads to severe cardiovascular impairment and ultimately death if not managed properly. Current therapeutic approach to hypertension management involves the use of drugs that inhibit excessive activities of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), the two main enzymes that control mammalian blood pressure. Since renin catalyzes a single reaction that is the rate-determining step in the renin-angiotensin system, inhibition of this enzyme activity could be a highly effective strategy for controlling blood pressure without severe negative side effects. However, therapeutic control of renin activity remains difficult with only one approved drug. Some food protein-derived peptides have been found to inhibit renin activity inhibition, which could offer a drug-free treatment for hypertension. Therefore, this review provides a summary of recent developments in the advances and efficacy testing of renin-inhibitory peptides.",

        "title": "Antihypertensive and antioxidant activities of enzymatic wheat bran protein hydrolysates.",
        "abstract": "Bioactive peptides from plant protein sources have been continuously identified as nutrient supplements for low toxicity but multiple physiological activities such as antihypertensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10\u00a0kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) higher for the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction (84.25%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.45%, 75.19%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and\u00a0>1\u00a0kDa fractions. The\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction also showed significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) higher oxygen radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.45 (\u03bcM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the\u00a0>1\u00a0kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) of the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35\u00a0mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20\u00a0mmHg) after 6\u00a0hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction showing high oxygen radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.",

        "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most prevalent liver disease globally. Pea albumin (PA) has demonstrated positive impacts on reducing obesity and improving glucose metabolism. In this research, a mouse model of NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) was employed to examine the impact of PA on NAFLD and explore its potential mechanisms. The findings revealed that mice subjected to a HFD developed pronounced fatty liver alterations. The intervention with PA significantly lowered serum TC by 26.81%, TG by 43.55%, and LDL-C by 57.79%. It also elevated HDL-C levels by 1.2 fold and reduced serum ALT by 37.94% and AST by 31.21% in mice fed a HFD. These changes contributed to the reduction in hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation. Additionally, PA improved insulin resistance and inhibited hepatic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Mechanistic studies revealed that PA alleviated lipid accumulation in HFD-induced NAFLD by activating the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 and ACC, inhibiting the expression of SREBF1 and FASN to reduce hepatic lipogenesis, and increasing the expression of ATGL, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 to promote lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. These results indicate that PA could serve as a dietary supplement for alleviating NAFLD, offering a theoretical foundation for the rational intake of PA in NAFLD intervention.",
