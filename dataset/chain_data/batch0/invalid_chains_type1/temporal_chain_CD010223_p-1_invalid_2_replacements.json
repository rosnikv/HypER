        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nPregnant women who are positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies [TPOAb(+)] are prone to develop postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) and permanent hypothyroidism. Selenium (Se) decreases thyroid inflammatory activity in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe examined whether Se supplementation, during and after pregnancy, influences the thyroidal autoimmune pattern and function.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Department of Endocrinology.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA total of 2143 euthyroid pregnant women participated in the study; 7.9% were TPOAb(+).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nDuring pregnancy and the postpartum period, 77 TPOAb(+) women received selenomethionine 200 microg/d (group S1), 74 TPOAb(+) women received placebo (group S0), and 81 TPOAb(-) age-matched women were the control group (group C).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe measured the prevalence of PPTD and hypothyroidism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPPTD and permanent hypothyroidism were significantly lower in group S1 compared with S0 (28.6 vs. 48.6%, P<0.01; and 11.7 vs. 20.3%, P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSe supplementation during pregnancy and in the postpartum period reduced thyroid inflammatory activity and the incidence of hypothyroidism.",

        "title": "Thyroid Autoimmunity and Environment",
        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) are the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, the former account for about 70-80% of liability to develop AITDs. However, at least 20-30% is contributed by environmental factors, which include certainly smoking (at least for Graves' disease and orbitopathy), probably stress, iodine and selenium intake, several drugs, irradiation, pollutants, viral and bacterial infections, allergy, pregnancy, and post-partum. Evidence for the intervention of these factors is often limited, and the mechanisms whereby environmental factors may concur to the onset of AITDs are in many instances unclear. Nevertheless, gene-environment interaction seems a fundamental process for the occurrence of AITDs.",

        "title": "The ocular surface in thyroid diseases",
        "abstract": "Purpose of reviewThe purpose of the present review is to describe recent insights into the pathomechanism of ocular surface impairment in the course of thyroid dysfunctions. The review focuses in particular on Graves' ophthalmopathy as the majority of the literature is published on this topic. Recent findingsMechanical factors were thought, until now, to be the indirect causes of ocular surface function failure. In particular, eyeglobe bulging and upper eyelid retraction with consequent eyelid fissure width increase were mainly considered responsible for increased exposed area and ocular surface impairment. Recent evidence demonstrated that ocular surface tissues are direct targets for autoantibodies in either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid states. A set of tear protein biomarkers were identified and shown to have high diagnostic performance. SummaryNew horizons can be displayed on the basis of these new findings, in particular, as referred earlier, Graves' ophthalmopathy diagnosis. A detailed slit-lamp examination and a careful medical history by validated questionnaires in patients with ocular surface discomfort symptoms are now recommended to investigate early manifestations of an underlying thyroid dysfunction. Ocular surface signs should also be included in professional guidelines. Autoantibody assays in tears and proteomic analysis of tear protein expression could be important further steps in early diagnosis and posttherapy control of thyroid dysfunction.",

        "title": "The effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine on lymphocyte and monocyte cytokine release in women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",
        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nNo previous study determined monocyte- and lymphocyte-suppressing effects of levothyroxine and selenomethionine and assessed whether their coadministration is superior to treatment with only one of these drugs.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to compare the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION\nWe conducted a randomized clinical trial involving a group of 170 ambulatory euthyroid women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 41 matched healthy subjects. Participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 6-month treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. One hundred sixty-five patients completed the study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMonocyte and lymphocyte release of proinflammatory cytokines and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control subjects, monocytes and lymphocytes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients released greater amounts of all cytokines studied. Levothyroxine reduced monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, whereas selenomethionine inhibited lymphocyte release of IL-2, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma CRP levels. The decrease in cytokine release and in plasma CRP levels was strongest when both drugs were given together.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite affecting different types of inflammatory cells, levothyroxine and selenomethionine exhibit a similar systemic antiinflammatory effect in euthyroid females with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This action, which correlates with a reduction in thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, may be associated with clinical benefits in the prevention and management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly in subjects receiving both agents.",

        "title": "Effects of selenium supplementation on the natural course of autoimmune thyroiditis: A short review",
        "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is an important element that exerts its effects on the selenoproteins. It is an essential component of the glutathione peroxidase enzymes, which have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and a component of iodothyronine selenodeiodinases, which catalyze the extrathyroid production of T3 from T4. Se is important to several aspects of thyroid homeostasis and may influence the natural course of thyroid diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). This review analyzes the effects of Se supplementation in patients with AIT, based on the studies published on this issue to date.",

We herein report a case of AVWS associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subcutaneous mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. An IgG autoantibody against von Willebrand factor (VWF) was detected. The antibody bound to VWF but did not inhibit VWF activity. Rapid clearance of VWF seemed to be the cause of AVWS in the present case. VWF-containing concentrates stopped the bleeding. Even if such a complication is rare, for AVWS patients, prompt recognition of the underlying mechanism can save lives.",

        "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), including Graves\u2019 Disease and Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis), are the most common organ-specific autoimmune disorders, occurring mostly in middle-aged women. AITDs are often associated with other autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo or systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), but there have been only few reports of AITDs concurring with CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasias), a limited form of scleroderma. Furthermore, these disorders have been associated with lymphoid malignancies, but only rarely with other cancers such as lung or breast. We report the case of a 59 year-old female patient who presented at the Endocrinology clinic for vertigo, dysphoria and fatigue. Clinical examination and serologic determinations revealed the diagnosis of an overlap syndrome between euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis and CREST syndrome. Further investigations led to the detection of an incipient gastric adenocarcinoma which was promptly treated with total gastrectomy.",
