        "abstract": "To assess whether ultrasound\u2010guided percutaneous acetic acid injection is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 60 patients with one to four HCCs smaller than 3 cm were entered onto a randomized controlled trial. Thirty\u2010one and 29 patients, respectively, were treated by percutaneous acetic acid injection using 50% acetic acid or by percutaneous ethanol injection using absolute ethanol. There were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, Child\u2010Pugh class, size of tumors, or number of tumors between the two groups. When there was no evidence of viable HCC from biopsy, plain and helical dynamic computed tomography, or angiography, the treatment was considered successful and was discontinued. All original tumors were treated successfully by either therapy. However, 8% of 38 tumors treated with percutaneous acetic acid injection and 37% of 35 tumors treated with percutaneous ethanol injection developed a local recurrence (P < .001) during the follow\u2010up periods of 29 \u00b1 8 months and 23 \u00b1 10 months, respectively. The 1\u2010 and 2\u2010year survival rates were 100% and 92% in percutaneous acetic acid injection and 83% and 63% in percutaneous ethanol injection (P = .0017). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed that treatment was an independent predictor of survival. The risk ratio of percutaneous acetic acid injection versus percutaneous ethanol injection was 0.120 (range, 0.027\u20100.528;P = .0050). In conclusion, percutaneous acetic acid injection is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of small HCC.",

        "title": "Chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma: Concept, progress and perspectives",
        "abstract": "Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often develops in patients with chronic liver diseases associated with hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections with high incidences. Particularly, post\u2010therapeutic recurrence encountered after the curative treatment of the preceding HCC may limit the prognosis. Thus, prevention of HCC is of great significance. In the present review, immunopreventions with \u03b1\u2010interferon and glycyrrhizin, as well as chemoprevention with acyclic retinoid, are discussed. \u03b1\u2010Interferon prevents the development of HCC not only in patients with a long\u2010term elimination of HCV (sustained virological responders), but in ones with normalized serum aminotransferases (sustained biochemical responders). Glycyrrhizin also suppresses serum aminotransferases and thereby prevents the tumor development, even though the compound does not have antiviral activity for HBV or HCV by itself. Therefore, suppression of hepatic necroinflammation by these drugs may serve to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis. In contrast, acyclic retinoid suppresses the post\u2010therapeutic recurrence in cirrhotic patients who underwent curative treatment of preceding tumors. The retinoid induces the disappearance of serum lectin\u2010reactive \u03b1\u2010fetoprotein (AFP\u2010L3), a tumor marker indicating the presence of unrecognizable tumors in the remnant liver, suggesting a deletion of such minute (pre)malignant clones (clonal deletion). As a molecular mechanism of the clonal deletion, a novel mechanism of apoptosis induction by the retinoid via tissue transglutaminase is implicated. In future, a combination of immunopreventive and chemopreventive therapies may give a clue to the further advances of cancer prevention, and thereby to the improvement of the prognosis of cirrhotic patients.",

        "title": "Systematic review of randomized trials for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Chemoembolization improves survival",
        "abstract": "There is no standard treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival benefits derived from medical interventions are controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of the impact of medical treatments on survival. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published as full papers assessing survival for primary treatments of HCC were included. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CANCERLIT, and a manual search from 1978 to May 2002 were used. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end point was response to treatment. Estimates of effect were calculated according to the random effects model. Sensitivity analysis included methodological quality. We identified 61 randomized trials, but only 14 met the criteria to perform a meta\u2010analysis assessing arterial embolization (7 trials, 545 patients) or tamoxifen (7 trials, 898 patients). Arterial embolization improved 2\u2010year survival compared with control (odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32\u20100.89; P = .017). Sensitivity analysis showed a significant benefit of chemoembolization with cisplatin or doxorubicin (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20\u20100.88) but none with embolization alone (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.29\u20101.20). Overall, treatment induced objective responses in 35% of patients (range, 16%\u201061%). Tamoxifen showed no antitumoral effect and no survival benefits (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.36\u20101.13; P = .13), and only low\u2010quality scale trials suggested 1\u2010year improvement in survival. In conclusion, chemoembolization improves survival of patients with unresectable HCC and may become the standard treatment. Treatment with tamoxifen does not modify the survival of patients with advanced disease.",

        "title": "Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal venous tumor thrombosis: A comprehensive review.",
        "abstract": "The natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is dismal (approximately 2-4 mo), and PVTT is reportedly found in 10%-40% of HCC patients at diagnosis. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System (which is the most widely adopted HCC management guideline), sorafenib is the standard of care for advanced HCC (i.e., BCLC stage C) and the presence of PVTT is included in this category. However, sorafenib treatment only marginally prolongs patient survival and, notably, its therapeutic efficacy is reduced in patients with PVTT. In this context, there have been diverse efforts to develop alternatives to current standard systemic chemotherapies or combination treatment options. To date, many studies on transarterial chemoembolization, 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, hepatic arterial chemotherapy, and transarterial radioembolization report better overall survival than sorafenib therapy alone, but their outcomes need to be verified in future prospective, randomized controlled studies in order to be incorporated into current treatment guidelines. Additionally, combination strategies have been applied to treat HCC patients with PVTT, with the hope that the possible synergistic actions among different treatment modalities would provide promising results. This narrative review describes the current status of the management options for HCC with PVTT, with a focus on overall survival.",

        "abstract": "Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib (SOR) are well-established treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of SOR combined with TACE in the treatment of patients with TACE-refractory, advanced-stage HCC. Methods This retrospective study included 61 patients with TACE-refractory advanced HCC. Patients were divided into TACE + SOR (n=30) and TACE (n=31) treatment groups. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two groups. Results Compared with TACE alone, the 5-year OS and TTP were prolonged in the TACE + SOR group (median OS: 17.9 vs 7.1 months, P<0.001; median TTP: 9.3 vs 3.4 months, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that Child\u2013Pugh class A (hazard ratio [HR], 0.234; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.092\u20130.595), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 (HR, 0.355; 95% CI, 0.153\u20130.826), alpha-fetoprotein <400 ng/mL (HR, 0.349; 95% CI, 0.177\u20130.689), and TACE + SOR treatment (HR, 0.151; 95% CI, 0.071\u20130.322) were independent, positive predictive factors of OS. Conclusion The OS and TTP in the combined treatment group were significantly improved when compared with the TACE group. However, no significant difference in DCR was found between these two groups. While no AEs occurred in the TACE group, two patients in the TACE + SOR group experienced severe AEs which were effectively mitigated by lowering the dose of SOR. Thus, SOR in combination with TACE is a safe and effective treatment for advanced-stage, prior-TACE-resistant HCC.",

        "abstract": "Background Triclosan is a widely applied antimicrobial agent which affects the endocrine system and homeostasis; it may also promote the cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth in a mice model. The exact roles of triclosan in regulating human hepatocellular carcinoma development and treatment remain unknown. Methods MHCC97-H, a highly aggressive HCC cell line, was treated with indicated concentration of triclosan or sorafenib. The expression of drug-resistance genes was examined by qPCR. The clearance or metabolism of sorafenib was determined by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). MTT assay was used to examine the MHCC97-H cell proliferation. Nude mice were used to exam the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib on subcutaneous and intrahepatic growth of MHCC97-H cells. Results In the present study, triclosan could induce the expression of drug-resistance genes in MHCC97-H cells (a highly aggressive HCC cell line), accelerate the clearance of sorafenib, and attenuate the anti-proliferation effect of this molecular targeted agent in MHCC97-H cells. Triclosan decreased the antitumor effect of sorafenib on subcutaneous and intrahepatic growth of MHCC97-H in nude mice. Conclusion By discovering the fact that triclosan treatment enhances sorafenib resistance in HCC cells, this work suggests exposure of triclosan is detrimental to HCC patients during chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the heaviest malignant burdens in China. Molecular targeting agent, sorafenib, is the main therapeutic option for antitumor therapy of advanced HCC, but it is currently too expensive for the public and its therapeutic effect does not satisfy initial expectation. Therefore, it is important to develop more effective molecular targeted therapeutic strategies for advanced HCC. Materials and methods The antitumor effects of sorafenib or ARQ-197, an antagonist of c-MET (tyrosine-protein kinase Met or hepatocyte growth factor receptor), were examined by MTT or in murine tumor model. The effect of ARQ-197 on epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) or multidrug resistance (MDR) was examined by quantitative real-time PCR for the expression of related genes. The clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells was detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Results ARQ-197 treatment enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. Mechanistic studies indicated that ARQ-197 inhibited the expression of EMT- and MDR-related genes. Moreover, ARQ-197 treatment decelerated the clearance of sorafenib in cultured HCC cells and subcutaneous HCC tumors in nude mice. Conclusion In the present work, our data suggested that ARQ-197 decelerated the clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells and enhanced the antitumor effect of sorafenib.",

        "abstract": "The MDM2 binding protein (MTBP) has been considered an important regulator of human malignancies. In this study, we demonstrate that the high level of MTBP\u2019s endogenous expression is correlated with poor prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who received sorafenib. MTBP interacted with the Pregnane X receptor (PXR) and enhanced the transcription factor activity of PXR. Moreover, MTBP enhanced the accumulation of PXR in HCC cells\u2019 nuclear and the recruitment of PXR to its downstream gene\u2019s (cyp3a4\u2019s) promoter region. Mechanically, the knockdown of MTBP in MHCC97-H cells with high levels of MTBP decelerated the clearance or metabolism of sorafenib in HCC cells and led to the resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib. Whereas overexpression of MTBP in in MHCC97-L cells with low levels of MTBP showed the opposite trend. By establishing the interaction between MTBP and PXR, our results indicate that MTBP could function as a co-activator of PXR and could be a promising therapeutic target to enhance the sensitivity of HCC cells to molecular targeting agents.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Notch pathway, which is related to the drug-resistance of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, is activated by cleavage of Notch proteins mediated by ADAMs, ADAM10 or ADAM17. Methods: In the present study, our results demonstrated that of these two ADAMs, the expression of ADAM10 in clinical samples of the LUAD type of NSCLC was much higher than that of ADAM17, while miR-140-3p - an miRNA that could target ADAM10 - was identified by an online tool: miRDB (miRNA database). The detail function and mechanism of miR-140-3p in regulating the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to antitumor drugs was systematically explored in vitro and in vivo. Results: In A549, a typical NSCLC LUAD cell line, miR-140-3p decreased ADAM10 expression and repressed activation of the Notch pathway by repressing cleavage of Notch proteins. The expression of miR-140-3p was negatively related to ADAM10 in clinical specimens. Nucleocytoplasmic separation/subfraction assays showed that miR-140-3p was able to inhibit the cleavage of Notch protein, and led to the accumulation of Notch intracellular domains (NICD) in the nucleus. Overexpression of miR-140-3p enhanced the sensitivity of A549 cells to antitumor agents by targeting the 3'UTR region of ADAM10 mRNA in both cultured cells and in vivo models. Conclusion: ADAM10 plays a major role in LUAD, and miR-140-3p acts on ADAM10 and inhibits its expression and the cleavage of Notch protein, leading to the inhibition the activity of the Notch pathway, and ultimately upregulating LUAD cell sensitivity to anti- tumor drugs.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary The MDM2 binding protein MTBP is implicated in various cellular functions and cancer-related processes, which vary depending on the cellular context and its localization within the cell. Moreover, the in vivo physiological function of MTBP remains unclear. To overcome embryonic lethality due to complete deletion of the Mtbp gene in mice, we created mice with an Mtbp hypomorphic allele (MtbpH) that expresses Mtbp protein at approximately 30% of the wild-type level. In a carcinogen-induced liver cancer model, MtbpH/\u2212 mice showed worse overall survival than wild-type mice. MEFs generated from the MtbpH/\u2212 mice displayed an increased nuclear localization of p-Erk1/2 protein and enhanced migratory potential. Thus, the newly generated MtbpH/\u2212 mice and MEFs can be used to study the in vivo physiological function of Mtbp and validate its diverse functions observed in human cells. Abstract MTBP is implicated in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and cancer metastasis. However, the function of MTBP remains enigmatic and is dependent on cellular contexts and its cellular localization. To understand the in vivo physiological role of MTBP, it is important to generate Mtbp knockout mice. However, complete deletion of the Mtbp gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality, while its heterozygous deletion shows modest biological phenotypes, including enhanced cancer metastasis. To overcome this and better characterize the in vivo physiological function of MTBP, we, for the first time, generated mice that carry an Mtbp hypomorphic allele (MtbpH) in which Mtbp protein is expressed at approximately 30% of that in the wild-type allele. We treated wild-type, Mtbp+/\u2212, and MtbpH/\u2212 mice with a liver carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and found that the MtbpH/\u2212 mice showed worse overall survival when compared to the wild-type mice. Consistent with previous reports using human liver cancer cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from the MtbpH/\u2212 mice showed an increase in the nuclear localization of p-Erk1/2 and migratory potential. Thus, MtbpH/\u2212 mice and cells from MtbpH/\u2212 mice are valuable to understand the in vivo physiological role of Mtbp and validate the diverse functions of MTBP that have been observed in human cells.",
