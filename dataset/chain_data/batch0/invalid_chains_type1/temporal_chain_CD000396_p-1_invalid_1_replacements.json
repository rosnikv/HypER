        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of etoricoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor, administered continuously over 52 weeks for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis 2-part, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, 52-week study evaluated 2 doses of etoricoxib (90 and 120 mg) compared with naproxen at 1,000 mg. A 6-week, active-comparator- and placebo-controlled period (part I) was followed by a 46-week active-comparator-controlled period (part II). The primary outcome measures (on 100-mm visual analog scales) were patient's assessment of spine pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 387 patients randomized to receive treatment, 301 (77.8%) completed part I and 284 (75.9%) completed part II. Compared with placebo over 6 weeks, those receiving 90 mg etoricoxib, 120 mg etoricoxib, and naproxen demonstrated significantly (P < 0.001) greater improvement in all primary end points; treatment effects (expressed as the difference in least squares mean change versus placebo) were 21-29 mm for spine pain, 18-25 mm for disease activity, and 11-15 mm for function. Compared with patients receiving naproxen, significantly greater improvement in all primary end points was demonstrated in the combined group receiving either 90 mg etoricoxib or 120 mg etoricoxib over 6 weeks, in each individual etoricoxib treatment group over 6 weeks, and in the combined etoricoxib group over 1 year (all P < 0.05); results for secondary and exploratory end points were generally consistent with those from the primary analysis. Among all groups, there were no significant differences in the incidence of overall clinical, drug-related, or serious adverse experiences (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs. Safety observations during part II were generally consistent with those in part I.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEtoricoxib at doses of 90 mg and 120 mg demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo over 6 weeks, and compared with naproxen over 1 year. These study results demonstrate that etoricoxib is generally safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious for the treatment of AS.",

        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, have come to play an important role in the pharmacologic management of arthritis and pain. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of etoricoxib in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, low back pain, acute postoperative pain, and primary dysmenorrhea. Comparative studies indicate at least similar efficacy with etoricoxib versus traditional NSAIDs. Etoricoxib was generally well tolerated in these studies with no new safety findings during long-term administration. The gastrointestinal, renovascular, and cardiovascular tolerability profiles of etoricoxib have been evaluated in large patient datasets, and further insight into the cardiovascular tolerability of etoricoxib and diclofenac will be gained from a large ongoing cardiovascular outcomes program (MEDAL). The available data suggest that etoricoxib is an efficacious alternative in the management of arthritis and pain, with the potential advantages of convenient once-daily administration and superior gastrointestinal tolerability compared with traditional NSAIDs.",

        "abstract": "Gastrotoxicity is a major problem for long-term therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). DICCIC (1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2-one) is a new diclofenac prodrug, which has proven anti-inflammatory activity without gastroulcerogenic effect. The aim of this work was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac from DICCIC (7.6 mg/kg equivalent to 8.1 mg/kg diclofenac) and diclofenac (8.1 mg/kg) administration in Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g (n=20). The doses were calculated by interspecific allometric scaling based on the 2 mg/kg from diary human dose of diclofenac. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes via the femoral artery through the implanted catheter. The plasma was separated and quantitation was made in a HPLC system with a UV-Vis detector. The confidence limits of the bioanalytical method were appropriate for its application in a preclinical pharmacokinetic study. The AUC of diclofenac from DICCIC (53.7\u00b1 5.8 ug/mL.min) was significantly less (Mann Whitney test, p<0.05) than that of diclofenac from diclofenac administration (885.9 \u00b1 124,8 ug/mL.min). Terminal half-life of diclofenac from DICCIC (50.1 \u00b1 17.2 min) was significantly less (Mann Whitney test, p<0.05) than that of diclofenac from diclofenac administration (247.4 \u00b1 100.9 min). Still the parameters clearance and distribution volume were calculated for diclofenac from diclofenac, whose results were 9.2 \u00b11.2 mL/min.kg and 3.3 \u00b11.2 L/kg, respectively. The results of DICCIC from DICCIC administration were 108.9 \u00b1 19.6 mL/min.kg and 7.8 \u00b1 2.4 L/kg for clearance and distribution volume, respectively. The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated that there was an increase in diclofenac elimination and a lower exposure to diclofenac with administration of DICCIC compared to diclofenac.",

The activity of axSpA (BASDAI, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) was evaluated at baseline, 2 and 12 weeks; adverse events were recorded at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. The number of patients who had achieved an ASAS40 response at 2 and 12 weeks were taken into consideration. RESULTS At 12 weeks, the continuous administration group displayed decreases in BASDAI from 8 to 4, in ASDAS from 3.8 to 2.6, and in hs-CRP levels from 9.5 to 3.9 mg/l; the intermittent administration group exhibited decreases in BASDAI from 7.6 to 6.0, in ASDAS from 3.5 to 3.1, and hs-CRP from 8.8 to 4.5 mg/l (p<0.05).

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of long-term and short-term continuous NSAIDs in patients with knee osteoarthritis with insufficient efficacy \u201con demand\u201d NSAIDs and SYSADOA.Study design. 12-week, prospective, comparative, randomized, single-center study.Materials and Methods. 180 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis aged 40 to 85 years with insufficient efficacy of \u201con demand\u201d NSAIDs and SYSADOA were examined. Anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended for everyone: 56 people took Naproxen (31.11%), 63 \u2014 Etoricoxib (35%), 61 \u2014 Ketoprofen (33.89%). Patients were randomized into two groups: 1st group \u2014 with 8-week continuous intake of NSAIDs, 2nd group \u2014 with a 2-week continuous course of NSAIDs.Results. There was a positive dynamics of pain syndrome according to VAS and decrease in the level of the WOMAC index in both groups after 2 weeks of therapy. The pain level (VAS) and WOMAC indices in 1st group achieved after 8 weeks significantly differed from the ones after 2 weeks of therapy (VAS dynamics \u201410.93\u00b12.43 mm, t = 42.64; p<0.001). In both groups we noted gradual significant increase in the average pain level according to VAS and WOMAC indices after NSAIDs cancellation. However, there was better control of pain in 1st group with long-term NSAID than in 2nd one. Safety profile of drug therapy was similar in both groups.Conclusion. The long-term 8-week use of NSAIDs in patients with knee osteoarthritis with insufficient efficacy \u201con demand\u201d NSAIDs and SYSADOA provides better dynamics of the pain syndrome than with 2-week therapy. After treatment is canceled longer prior NSAID therapy contributes to better control of the pain syndrome. Continuous use of NSAIDs demonstrated good tolerance and safety, did not require dose reduction and/or discontinuation of therapy. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy of osteoarthritis in this group of patients may be prescribed for a longer period with continuous use of NSAIDs.",

Osteoarthritis (OA) in the Russian Federation is still not included in the list of socially significant diseases, despite the fact that this pathology limits the level of physical activity of the population more than diseases of the cardiovascular system, visual impairment and diabetes. European experts emphasize the relevance of research to develop methods to improve the effectiveness of viscosupplementary therapy in OA. The purpose of the study. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and long-term results of treatment of gonarthrosis with sodium hyaluronate.Materials and methods. The study included 180 patients with gonarthrosis with insufficient efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on demand and oral symptomatic slow-acting drugs against osteoarthritis (SYSADOA). The patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1: 50 patients who received sodium hyaluronate (Ripart\u00ae; Ingal, Russia) intra-articularly. Group 2: 30 patients received intra-articular SYSADOA (bioactive concentrate of small marine fish). The control group consisted of 100 patients who received drugs of the SYSADOA group intramuscularly.Results. An effective reduction in pain both at rest and during movement was achieved in most patients of all groups, but the treatment groups differed statistically significantly in the speed of achieving the clinical effect and its duration. In the 1st group, a significant decrease in the VAS pain index was observed already at the 1st week and by the 3rd month it was \u201349.1 % (p < 0.001). In the comparison and control groups, the indicators of speed, the degree of pain reduction, and the duration of the effect of therapy were also significant (p \u2264 0.050). But the effectiveness of therapy in these groups was statistically significantly lower than in patients of group 1 (p \u2265 0.050). It should be emphasized that the intra-articular administration of sodium hyaluronate provided a significant reduction in the need for patients to additionally take NSAIDs. After 3 months of therapy, only 5 patients (10 %) of this group continued to take NSAIDs (p < 0.001); 20 \u2013 completely stopped taking NSAIDs (40 %) and 25 (50 %) reduced the dose of NSAIDs taken, the duration of the effect lasted up to 12 months.Conclusions. In our study, sodium hyaluronate demonstrated high efficiency in reducing pain in patients with gonarthrosis and contributed to a significant decrease in the need for patients to take NSAIDs for 12 months.",
