        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. Its goals of therapy are to eliminate the symptoms of hyperglycaemia, reduce the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications and allow the patients to achieve a normal life-style. Basal insulin replacement for insulin dependent patients can be achieved with either intermediate or long acting insulin preparations.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of intermediate acting versus long acting insulin preparations for basal insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, as well as reference lists, databases of ongoing trials, and requests from authors of included trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials, assessing long acting insulin preparations compared to intermediate acting insulin preparations, in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo reviewers independently scanned the titles. Data were extracted and analysed accordingly.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nTwenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified. A total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively, were analysed. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the level of glycosylated haemoglobin was -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.04) in favour of the long acting insulin arm. The WMD between the groups in fasting plasma and blood glucose levels was -0.63 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.40) and -0.86 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.72) in favour of the long acting insulins. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulin to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. The OR for severe hypoglycaemic episodes was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), and 0.70 (95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79) for nocturnal episodes. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups for hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow up days was -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.65), -0.0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and -0.40 (95% CI -0.45 to -0.34) for overall, severe, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Weight gain was more prominent in the control group. No difference was noted in the quantity or quality of severe adverse events or deaths.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLong acting insulin preparations seem to exert a beneficial effect on nocturnal glucose levels. Their effect on the overall diabetes control is clinically unremarkable. Their use as a basal insulin regimen for type 1 diabetes mellitus warrants further substantiation.",

        "title": "Are bedtime nutritional strategies effective in preventing nocturnal hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes?",
        "abstract": "Hypoglycaemia remains the major limiting factor for adequate diabetes control for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), especially during the night\u2010time. Although nutritional strategies for nocturnal hypoglycaemia (NH) prevention are regularly suggested in clinical practice, there is no evidence\u2010based recommendation for the usefulness and optimal composition of a bedtime snack. The aim of this narrative review was to analyse the current state of knowledge on nutritional strategies to prevent NH in individuals with T1D. A literature search was conducted, using PubMed and Medline (1946 to 2013); 16 studies were retrieved. Overall, the level of evidence was low. Results indicated that a calibrated bedtime snack based on bedtime blood glucose (BG) level could be effective to reduce NH occurrence for patients treated with human or animal insulin (short\u2010acting combined with lente, ultralente and/or intermediate\u2010acting insulin), but there is no evidence for patients treated with insulin analogues as part of multiple daily injections or insulin pump regimen. Some evidence suggests that including uncooked cornstarch or alanine in the bedtime snack composition could provide some benefits for the prevention of NH. Individualized recommendations of a bedtime snack intake for patients or situations at high risk for NH (long standing diabetes, hypoglycaemia unawareness, prior physical activity, alcohol consumption, bedtime BG close to hypoglycaemia threshold) appear as a prudent recommendation. On the basis of the available evidence, a bedtime snack cannot be recommended systematically but it might be useful if prescribed in an individualized fashion; further research is needed to evaluate these strategies.",

        "title": "Insulin therapy and dietary adjustments to normalize glycemia and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Introduction Evening-time exercise is a frequent cause of severe hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes, fear of which deters participation in regular exercise. Recommendations for normalizing glycemia around exercise consist of prandial adjustments to bolus insulin therapy and food composition, but this carries only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of a combined basal-bolus insulin dose reduction and carbohydrate feeding strategy on glycemia and metabolic parameters following evening exercise in type 1 diabetes. Methods Ten male participants (glycated hemoglobin: 52.4\u00b12.2\u2005mmol/mol), treated with multiple daily injections, completed two randomized study-days, whereby administration of total daily basal insulin dose was unchanged (100%), or reduced by 20% (80%). Participants attended the laboratory at \u223c08:00\u2005h for a fasted blood sample, before returning in the evening. On arrival (\u223c17:00\u2005h), participants consumed a carbohydrate meal and administered a 75% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose and 60\u2005min later performed 45\u2005min of treadmill running. At 60\u2005min postexercise, participants consumed a low glycemic index (LGI) meal and administered a 50% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose, before returning home. At \u223c23:00\u2005h, participants consumed a LGI bedtime snack and returned to the laboratory the following morning (\u223c08:00\u2005h) for a fasted blood sample. Venous blood samples were analyzed for glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, non-esterified fatty acids, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. Interstitial glucose was monitored for 24\u2005h pre-exercise and postexercise. Results Glycemia was similar until 6\u2005h postexercise, with no hypoglycemic episodes. Beyond 6\u2005h glucose levels fell during 100%, and nine participants experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia. Conversely, all participants during 80% were protected from nocturnal hypoglycemia, and remained protected for 24\u2005h postexercise. All metabolic parameters were similar. Conclusions Reducing basal insulin dose with reduced prandial bolus insulin and LGI carbohydrate feeding provides protection from hypoglycemia during and for 24\u2005h following evening exercise. This strategy is not associated with hyperglycemia, or adverse metabolic disturbances. Clinical trials number NCT02204839, ClinicalTrials.gov.",

        "abstract": "Optimal blood glucose management still remains the biggest challenge in active individuals with diabetes, particularly in insulin users, but some newer strategies have been introduced to maintain blood glucose control. Recent studies emphasize the importance of exercise intensity on glycemic balance. In individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, both resistance and high-intensity intermittent exercise have been shown to confer beneficial physiological adaptations in training studies, while also showing acute glycemic benefits from single sessions. At the same time, anyone training at higher intensities also should take into consideration potential impairments in thermoregulation in individuals with diabetes, which can increase the risk of heat stress during exercise in hot and/or humid conditions. Recent studies of medication effects on electrolyte balance and hydration give a more complete picture of potential exercise risks for athletes with diabetes. Use of the latest diabetes-related technologies also may benefit the athlete with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE We evaluated the safety and feasibility of open-source automated insulin delivery AndroidAPS, in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and compared its efficacy in three different scenarios: Hybrid Closed Loop with premeal boluses (HCL), Meal Announcement only (MA) and Full Closed Loop (FCL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In an open-label, prospective, randomized crossover trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04835350), 16 adolescents with T1D (10 females) with mean age 17 years (range 15-20), HbA1c 56 mmol/mol (range 43-75) and mean duration of diabetes 5.9 years (9-15), underwent three distinct 3-day periods of camp living, comparing the above-mentioned scenarios of AndroidAPS. We used modified and locked version of AndroidAPS 3.1.03 which was called Pancreas4ALL for study purpose. The order of MA and FCL periods was assigned randomly. The primary endpoints were feasibility and safety of the system represented by percentage of time of glucose control by the system and time in hypoglycemia below 3 mmol/L. RESULTS The glycemia was controlled by the system 95% time of the study and the proportion of time below 3 mmol/L did not exceed 1% over the whole study period (0.72%). The HCL scenario reached significantly higher percentage of time below 3 mmol/L (HCL 1.05% vs MA 0.0% vs FCL 0.0%; p=0.05) compared to other scenarios. No differences were observed among the scenarios in the percentage of time between 3.9-10 mmol/L (HCL 83.3% vs MA 79.85% vs FCL 81.03%, p=0.58) corresponding to mean glycemia (HCL 6.65mmol/L vs MA 7.34mmol/L vs FCL-7.05mmol/L, p=0.28). No differences were observed in the mean daily dose of insulin nor in the daily carbohydrate intake. No serious adverse events occurred during the study period. CONCLUSIONS Our pilot study showed that Fully Closed Loop might be a realistic mode of treatment for people with type 1 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems enhance glucose management by lowering mean glucose level, reducing hyperglycemia, and minimizing hypoglycemia. One feature of most AID systems is that they allow the user to view \"insulin on board\" (IOB) to help confirm a recent bolus and limit insulin stacking. This metric, along with viewing glucose concentrations from a continuous glucose monitoring system, helps the user understand bolus insulin action and the future \"threat\" of hypoglycemia. However, the current presentation of IOB in AID systems can be misleading, as it does not reflect true insulin action or automatic, dynamic insulin adjustments. This commentary examines the evolution of IOB from a bolus-specific metric to its contemporary use in AID systems, highlighting its limitations in capturing real-time insulin modulation during varying physiological states.",
