        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNo therapy has been shown to reliably prevent the evolution of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

        "title": "Recent advances of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel diseases.",
        "abstract": "Endoscopy plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most valuable tool for distinguishing different types of IBD is a complete ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsy. Endoscopic localization of the disease not only aids in determining prognosis and appropriateness of medical therapies but also aids decision-making in those undergoing surgical therapy. With regard to therapeutic applications, obstructive symptoms caused by benign fibrotic strictures can be treated adequately by endoscopic balloon dilation. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with both ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease (CD). Colonoscopy is currently considered to be the gold standard for cancer surveillance. Published guidelines recommend that two to four biopsy samples should be obtained every 10 cm in the colorectum, necessitating 20-50 samplings per examination. This may result in standard colonoscopy - which is also very time-consuming and laborious - missing significant numbers of small lesions. Various novel techniques have been applied to reduce the required number of biopsy samples and the duration of examinations, including chromoendoscopy with or without magnification, fluorescence endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, optical coherence tomography, and confocal laser endomicroscopy. Until recently the only way to evaluate the small-bowel mucosa in a patient with CD was by barium small-bowel radiographs and intubation of the distal terminal ileum. Both wireless-capsule endoscopy (WCE) and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) allow light to be used in the inspection of the small bowel and may replace radiological methods. WCE is more convenient than DBE for probing small-bowel mucosal changes, but only DBE allows a biopsy sample to be obtained from the deep small bowel, and these two examinations can be considered complementary. The wider application of new techniques in the near future might increase the role played by endoscopy in the management of IBD.",

        "title": "Severity of postoperative recurrence in crohn's disease: Correlation between endoscopic and sonographic findings",
        "abstract": "Background: Crohn's disease (CD) recurrence is currently assessed by ileocolonoscopy. Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) visualizes the small bowel lesions in CD, although its role after curative resection is undefined. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of SICUS in assessing CD recurrence after ileocolonic resection when using ileocolonoscopy as a gold standard. The correlation between the bowel wall thickness (BWT) measured by SICUS and the endoscopic score of recurrence was also assessed. Methods: The analysis included 72 CD patients with ileocolonic resection requiring ileocolonoscopy, undergoing SICUS within 6 months. Recurrence was assessed by ileocolonoscopy using the Rutgeerts' score. SICUS was performed after PEG ingestion and findings compatible with recurrence included: increased BWT (>3 mm), bowel dilation (>25 mm) or stricture (<10 mm). Results: Ileocolonoscopy detected recurrence in 67/72 (93%) patients. SICUS detected findings compatible with recurrence in 62/72 (86%) patients (5 false negative (FN), 4 false positive (FP), 1 true negative (TN), 62 true positive (TP)), showing a 92.5% sensitivity, 20% specificity, and 87.5% accuracy for detecting CD recurrence. The BWT detected by SICUS was correlated with the Rutgeerts' score (P = 0.0001; r = 0.67). The median BWT, the extent of the ileal lesions, and the prestenotic dilation were higher in patients with an endoscopic degree of recurrence \u22653 versus \u22642 (P < 0.001) and the lumen diameter was lower in patients with a Rutgeerts' score \u22653 versus \u22642 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Although SICUS and ileocolonoscopy provide different views of the small bowel, SICUS shows a significant correlation with the endoscopic findings. SICUS may represent an alternative noninvasive technique for assessing CD recurrence after ileocolonic resection. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2009)",

        "abstract": "Diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging data. Imaging of the morphological characteristics of IBD includes the assessment of mucosal alterations, transmural involvement and extraintestinal manifestations. No single imaging technique serves as a diagnostic gold standard to encompass all disease manifestations. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow cross-sectional imaging of the transmural alterations and extraintestinal manifestations. While in the USA the technique of choice is CT, in Europe the focus is more on MRI and ultrasound (US). Most patients with chronic IBD are diagnosed at a young age. After baseline diagnosis many of these young patients have to undergo repetitive imaging procedures during the variable clinical course of the disease, characterized by alternate periods of remission and active disease, and in monitoring the response to treatment. US has the advantage of being noninvasive, less costly, and easily repeatable, and thus can be very useful in following up patients with IBD. In addition, rising concern about radiation exposure in young adults indicates the demand for radiation-sparing techniques like US and MRI. This article focuses on the current clinical practice of US in IBD, describing the current technologies used in transabdominal intestinal US and the characteristic sonographic findings in Crohn\u00b4s disease and ulcerative colitis.",

Imaging can help direct therapy and can predict important patient outcomes. In a rapidly changing, technology-driven field, new imaging applications add novel insights that we are only beginning to appreciate. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in imaging as they are applied to the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. Recent findings In the past year, key literature describing cross-sectional imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) based imaging, specifically CT enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), transcutaneous ultrasound, and PET-based imaging, has emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease. MRI sequences that have been recently applied to Crohn's disease assessment, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), add important new insights. These new data highlight the current status of available imaging modalities and provide a glimpse into the future of our practice. Summary CTE and MRE are our new standard imaging modalities for small bowel Crohn's disease. PET scanning is promising but currently only used routinely in centers with a strong research presence in this area. Ultrasound is emerging as a useful, potentially less costly, radiation-free technique. New MRI sequences offer future promise for effectively monitoring the natural history of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by a relapsing-remitting clinical behavior and dominated by intestinal inflammation. Being a chronic disorder that with time develops into a disabling disease, it is important to monitor the severity of inflammation to assess the efficacy of medication, rule out complications, and prevent progression. This is particularly true now that the goals of treatment are mucosal healing and deep remission. Endoscopy has always been the gold standard for assessing mucosal activity in CD, but its use is limited by its invasiveness and its inability to examine the small intestine, proximal to the terminal ileum. Enteroscopy and the less invasive small bowel capsule endoscopy enable the small bowel to be thoroughly explored and scores are emerging for classifying small bowel disease activity. Cross-sectional imaging techniques (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography) are emerging as valid tools for monitoring CD patients, assessing inflammatory activity in the mucosa and the transmucosal extent of the disease, and for excluding extra-intestinal complications. Neither endoscopy nor imaging are suitable for assessing patients frequently, however. Noninvasive markers such as C-reactive protein, and fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin, are therefore useful to confirm the inflammatory burden of the disease and to identify patients requiring further investigations.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims\nIncreased small intestinal wall thickness correlates with both inflammatory activity and fibrosis in Crohn's disease [CD]. Assessment of perfusion holds promise as an objective marker distinguishing between the two conditions. Our primary aim was to determine if relative bowel wall perfusion measurements correlate with histopathological scores for inflammation or fibrosis in CD.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 25 patients were investigated before elective surgery for small intestinal CD. Unenhanced ultrasonography [US] and magnetic resonance enterography [MRE] were applied to describe bowel wall thickness. Perfusion was assessed with contrast-enhanced US [CEUS] and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRE [DCE-MRE]. Histopathology was used as gold standard.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with histopathology, the mean wall thickness was 0.4 mm greater on US [range -0.3 to 1.0, p = 0.24] and 1.4 mm greater on MR [0.4 to 2.3, p = 0.006]. No correlation was found between the severity of inflammation or fibrosis on histopathology, and either DCE-MRE [r = -0.13, p = 0.54 for inflammation and r = 0.41, p = 0.05 for fibrosis] or CEUS [r = 0.16, p = 0.45 for inflammation and r = -0.28, p = 0.19 for fibrosis].

        "abstract": "Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease commonly develop ileal and less commonly colonic strictures, containing various degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. While predominantly inflammatory strictures may benefit from a medical anti-inflammatory treatment, predominantly fibrotic strictures currently require endoscopic balloon dilation or surgery. Therefore, differentiation of the main components of a stricturing lesion is key for defining the therapeutic management. The role of endoscopy to diagnose the nature of strictures is limited by the superficial inspection of the intestinal mucosa, the lack of depth of mucosal biopsies and by the risk of sampling error due to a heterogeneous distribution of inflammation and fibrosis within a stricturing lesion. These limitations may be in part overcome by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT and MRI, allowing for a full thickness evaluation of the bowel wall and associated abnormalities. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive summary of currently used radiologic definitions of strictures. It discusses, by assessing only manuscripts with histopathology as a gold standard, the accuracy for diagnosis of the respective modalities as well as their capability to characterise strictures in terms of inflammation and fibrosis. Definitions for strictures on cross-sectional imaging are heterogeneous; however, accuracy for stricture diagnosis is very high. Although conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques have been reported to distinguish inflammation from fibrosis and grade their severity, they are not sufficiently accurate for use in routine clinical practice. Finally, we present recent consensus recommendations and highlight experimental techniques that may overcome the limitations of current technologies.",
