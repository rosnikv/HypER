        "abstract": "The efficacy, toxicity and possible steroid-sparing properties of auranofin in the treatment of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) were studied in a 2 yr prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty-five patients with onset of arthritis after the age of 60 yr were randomized to either auranofin 3 mg b.i.d. [n = 31, age 70 (61-84) yr, median (range)] or placebo tablets [n = 34, age 72 (60-81) yr]. Oral prednisolone, starting dose 7.5 or 20 mg daily, was used as a rescue drug in patients with intolerable joint pain and stiffness and with C-reactive protein (CRP) > or = 20 mg/l, and was tapered down according to protocol guidelines. Patients receiving auranofin continued therapy for a longer period of time (55% completers) than those on placebo medication (18% completers). The auranofin group consumed significantly less prednisolone, 2.64 (0-11.85) mg/day [median (range)], compared to 5.0 (0-18.33) mg/day in the placebo group (P = 0.006). No group differences at 2 yr follow-up were found for changes in joint pain (P = 0.49), number of swollen joints (P = 0.61), Health Assessment Questionnaire score (P = 0.18) and radiographic damage score (Larsen-Dale index) of the hands (P = 0.84). Within-group changes in radiographic scores were also insignificant. The drop-out rate due to adverse events was surprisingly higher in the placebo group (41%) than in the auranofin group (10%) and, as expected, higher due to lack of effect (29 and 16%). The results indicate that auranofin is safe, superior to placebo and has steroid-sparing capacity in the treatment of EORA. The favourable radiographic outcome in both groups needs confirmation in future studies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To compare three therapeutic strategies using slow acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for their disease modifying properties, toxicity, and lag time until treatment effect. METHODS Patients with recent onset RA from six hospitals were randomly assigned to immediate initiation of one of three treatment strategies: (I) a \u201cmild SAARD with a long lag time\u201d (hydroxychloroquine, if necessary replaced by auranofin); (II) a \u201cpotent SAARD with a long lag time\u201d (intramuscular gold, if necessary replaced byd-penicillamine); (III) a \u201cpotent SAARD with a short lag time\u201d (methotrexate, if necessary replaced by sulfasalazine). Comparisons included two years of follow up. RESULTS All SAARD strategies reduced mean disease activity. A greater percentage of patients improved clinically with strategies II and III than with strategy I: percentages of patients improved on joint score with strategies II and III (79% and 82%, respectively), which was statistically different from strategy I (66%). The same was true for remission percentages: 31% and 24% v 16%, respectively). Longitudinal analysis showed significantly less disability with strategy III, and a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate with strategy II than with strategy I. In addition, radiological damage after one and two years, was significantly lower in strategies II and III (at two years median scores were 11 and 10v 14 in strategy I, p<0.05). Toxicity was increased in strategy II compared with the other strategies. CONCLUSION Strategy III, comprising methotrexate or sulfasalazine, produced the best results weighing effectiveness and toxicity. Strategy I (hydroxychloroquine or auranofin) was slightly less effective, and strategy II (intramuscular gold or d-penicillamine) was associated with increased toxicity.",

        "abstract": "We read with interest the report of the WOSERACT trial1 that compared the addition of 7 mg daily prednisolone or placebo to sulfasalazine in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A number of important aspects of the trial have been dealt with well: the sample size is adequate; appropriate attention has been paid to confounders; two separate and independent readers scored the radiographs; the 2 year trial was of adequate length; and the completeness of the data is satisfactory. Given these strengths, it is all the more disappointing that the results of the main outcome, radiographic damage, cannot be adequately interpreted as they are reported. Indeed, the validity of these results is open to serious doubt. We feel there is a real possibility of a type II statistical error (missing a true difference between treatment arms). There are two (possibly three) reasons for this.\n\nFirstly, there is an absolute difference between the x ray scores of the two readers of about 40 Sharp points. This raises strong doubts over the proficiency of either or both readers. In early RA Sharp scores are typically very low, with most patients scoring 0 and only a few with higher scores. Scores of 80, let alone 159, after one year of RA are without precedent in the literature, and even the baseline medians of 6 and 8 recorded for the conservative reader are quite high. In contrast with the authors, we cannot be \u201creassured\u201d by their assertion that \u201cthe change in x ray score was consistent between the two readers\u201d: these data are simply not provided in the report.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMore timely and effective therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has contributed to increasing rates of clinical remission. However, progression of structural damage may still occur in patients who have satisfied remission criteria, which suggests that there is ongoing disease activity. This questions the validity of current methods of assessing remission in RA. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that modern joint imaging improves the accuracy of remission measurement in RA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 107 RA patients receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy who were judged by their consultant rheumatologist to be in remission and 17 normal control subjects. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, functional, and quality of life assessments. The Disease Activity Score 28-joint assessment and the American College of Rheumatology remission criteria, together with strict clinical definitions of remission, were applied. Imaging of the hands and wrists using standardized acquisition and scoring techniques with conventional 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US) were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIrrespective of which clinical criteria were applied to determine remission, the majority of patients continued to have evidence of active inflammation, as shown by findings on the imaging assessments. Even in asymptomatic patients with clinically normal joints, MRI showed that 96% had synovitis and 46% had bone marrow edema, and US showed that 73% had gray-scale synovial hypertrophy and 43% had increased power Doppler signal. Only mild synovial thickening was seen in 3 of the control subjects (18%), but no bone marrow edema.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost RA patients who satisfied the remission criteria with normal findings on clinical and laboratory studies had imaging-detected synovitis. This subclinical inflammation may explain the observed discrepancy between disease activity and outcome in RA. Imaging assessment may be necessary for the accurate evaluation of disease status and, in particular, for the definition of true remission.",

Standard evaluation included clinical, laboratory, functional and systematic (44 joints) US assessment. US indexes of grey scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) synovitis were correlated with clinical evaluation, laboratory indexes and clinical outcome. Clinical remission was defined when DAS was <1.6 at two consecutive visits 3 months apart.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUS examination was significantly more sensitive than clinical examination, both in active disease and in remission. In patients with an active disease, both clinical and US indexes correlated with CRP, whereas in remission only PD still remained significantly correlated. In clinical remission, 95% of the patients showed residual GS synovitis, and 41% of them showed a positive PD signal. Positive PD signal, even in a single joint, resulted the main predictor of relapse within 6 months, both in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a cohort of early RA patients treated with conventional DMARDs, US-GS can detect residual disease activity more sensitively than clinical examination both in active disease and in remission.

        "abstract": "T he European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) plan to initiate a task force to alter the political perception of rheumatology and encourage increased recognition of the specialty. There are several myths regarding arthritis that need to be clarified. These include the notions that it is a disease of the elderly, that there is no effective treatment, and that it undoubtedly lead to severe deformities and loss of function but does not increase mortality. As a result, rheumatology does not carry the same importance and immediacy as other medical specialties such as oncology or cardiovascular medicine. Although these myths may have been partly true a few decades ago, they are not anymore. In fact, it has been shown that rheumatology patients gain great benefit from being managed by rheumatologists instead of general practitioners (GPs). It has also now been shown that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) increases morbidity and mortality predominantly because of accelerated cardiovascular disease. Over the last decade, significant advances have been made, and the natural history of arthritis is changing. Effective treatment is now available for many conditions that were previously regarded as untreatable. Evidence also suggests that early treatment provides greater benefits and should be instigated as soon as an accurate diagnosis is made. This applies not only to conditions with serious consequences occurring as a result of unaltered progression, e.g., lupus flares or erosive arthropathy, but also to simple complaints such as back pain, where data suggest that outcome strongly correlates with the timing of treatment. Interestingly, a 3-month cutoff period seems to apply to various diseases from RA to mechanical problems such as frozen shoulders. Outcome significantly deteriorates when patients are left untreated for more than 3 months. Changes in gene expression from synovial biopsies provide a potential explanation for inflammatory conditions. In painful conditions, the reason is less clear, but could be partly explained by a loss of neuronal plasticity.",

Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty-eight patients with long standing RA (LSRA), 75% non or poorly responsive to one or more TNF\u03b1 blockers, all seropositive for at least one autoantibody (AAB) (RF-IgM, RF-IgA, RF-IgG, anti-MCV, ACPA-IgG, ACPA-IgA, ACPA-IgM) received one full course of BCDT. The major outcomes (moderate or good-EULAR response) were assessed after 6 months of therapy. The IL6 and BAFF levels were also determined. Results At a 6-month follow-up, 33 (23.9%) of the RA patients achieved a good EULAR response. Having up to 5-AABs positivity increased the chances for treatment response. After a logistic regression analysis, however, only 4 baseline factors arose as associated with a good-EULAR response: no steroid therapy (OR\u200a=\u200a6.25), a lymphocyte count <1875/uL (OR\u200a=\u200a10.74), a RF-IgG level >52.1 IU/ml (OR\u200a=\u200a8.37) and BAFF levels <1011 pg/ml (OR\u200a=\u200a7.38). When all the AABs, except for RF-IgM and ACPA-IgG, were left in the analysis, the two final predictors were no-steroid therapy and low lymphocyte count. Discussion The number of AABs increased the chances of being a \u201cgood-EULAR\u201d responder. The only predictors, however, at the baseline of a good response in this seropositive cohort of RA patients were 2 simple variables \u2013 no steroids and lymphocyte count \u2013 and two laboratory assays \u2013 IgG-RF and BAFF.",

Fifteen years later, the dramatic expansion of new data on MSUS in the literature coupled with technological developments in US imaging has necessitated an update of these guidelines. Objectives To update the existing MSUS guidelines in rheumatology as well as to extend their scope to other anatomic structures relevant for rheumatology. Methods The project consisted of the following steps: (1) a systematic literature review of MSUS evaluable structures; (2) a Delphi survey among rheumatologist and radiologist experts in MSUS to select MS and non-MS anatomic structures evaluable by US that are relevant to rheumatology, to select abnormalities evaluable by US and to prioritise these pathologies for rheumatology and (3) a nominal group technique to achieve consensus on the US scanning procedures and to produce an electronic illustrated manual (ie, App of these procedures). Results Structures from nine MS and non-MS areas (ie, shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand, hip, knee, ankle and foot, peripheral nerves, salivary glands and vessels) were selected for MSUS in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and their detailed scanning procedures (ie, patient position, probe placement, scanning method and bony/other landmarks) were used to produce the App. In addition, US evaluable abnormalities present in RMD for each anatomic structure and their relevance for rheumatology were agreed on by the MSUS experts.

Methods A web-based exercise and subsequent patient-based exercise were carried out. A panel of 30 OMERACT members, participated at the web-based exercise by evaluating twice a set of US images for the presence/absence of CPPD. Afterwards, 19 members of the panel met in Siena, Italy, for the patient-based exercise. During the exercise, all sonographers examined twice eight patients for the presence/absence of CPPD at the same joints. Intraoberserver and interobserver kappa values were calculated for both exercises. Results The web-based exercise yielded high kappa values both in intraobserver and interobserver evaluation for all sites, while in the patient-based exercise, inter-reader agreement was acceptable for the TFC and the AC. TFC reached high interobserver and intraobserver k values in both exercises, ranging from 0.75 to 0.87 (good to excellent agreement). AC reached moderate kappa values, from 0.51 to 0.85 (moderate to excellent agreement) and can readily be used for US CPPD identification. Conclusions Based on the results of our exercise, the OMERACT US definitions for the identification of CPPD demonstrated to be reliable when applied to the TFC and AC.

The best sensitivity and specificity were obtained by assessing in combination by ultrasound the medial meniscus and the medial condyle HC (88% and 76%, respectively). No differences were found between patients with and without CPPD regarding ultrasound signs of inflammation. Conclusion Ultrasound demonstrated to be an accurate tool for discriminating CPPD. No differences were found between patents with OA alone and CPPD plus OA regarding inflammation.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the identification of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals compared to microscopic analysis of joint tissues as the reference standard. This is an ancillary study of an international, multicentre cross-sectional study performed by the calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) subgroup of the OMERACT Ultrasound working group. Consecutive patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) waiting for total knee replacement surgery were enrolled in the study from 2 participating centres in Mexico and Romania. During the surgical procedures, synovial fluid, menisci and hyaline cartilage were collected and analysed within 48 hours from surgery under transmitted light microscopy and compensated polarised light microscopy for the presence/absence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. All slides were analysed by expert examiners on site, blinded to other findings. A dichotomic score (absence/ presence) was used for scoring both synovial fluid and tissues. Microscopic analysis of knee tissues was considered the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of synovial fluid analysis in the identification of calcium pyrophosphate crystals were calculated. 15 patients (53% female, mean age 68 yo \u00b1 8.4) with OA of grade 3 or 4 according to Kellgren-Lawrence scoring were enrolled. 12 patients (80%) were positive for calcium pyrophosphate crystals at the synovial fluid analysis and 14 (93%) at the tissue microscopic analysis. The overall diagnostic accuracy of synovial fluid analysis compared with histology for CPPD was 87%, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100%, the positive predictive value was 100% and the negative predictive value was 33%. In conclusion synovial fluid analysis proved to be an accurate test for the identification of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in patients with advanced OA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective To develop the optimal US scanning protocol for the diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease. Methods In this cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with a crystal-proven diagnosis of CPPD disease, and age-, sex-matched disease controls with a negative synovial fluid analysis were prospectively enrolled in two Italian Institutions. Four rheumatologists, blinded to patients\u2019 clinical details, performed US examinations using a standardized scanning protocol including 20 joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints from second to fifth fingers, hips, knees, ankles). CPPD was identified as presence/absence, according to the OMERACT definitions. Reduced US scanning protocols were developed by selecting the most informative joints to be imaged by US using the LASSO technique. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation sets. Their diagnostic accuracy was tested comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The number of participants enrolled was 204: 102 with CPPD disease and 102 disease controls [age, mean (s.d.): 71.3\u2009(12.0) vs 71.1\u2009(13.5)\u2009years; female: 62.8% vs 57.8%]. The median number of joints with US evidence of CPPD was 5 [interquartile range (IQR): 4\u20137] and 0 (IQR: 0\u20131) in patients with CPPD disease and controls, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The detection of CPPD in \u22652 joints using a reduced scanning protocol (bilateral assessment of knees, wrists and hips) showed a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI: 82.8, 99.9) and a specificity of 100 (95% CI: 88.8, 100.0) for the diagnosis of CPPD disease and had good feasibility [mean (s.d.): 12.5\u2009(5.3)\u2009min]. Conclusion Bilateral US assessment of knees, wrists and hips had excellent accuracy and good feasibility for the diagnosis of CPPD disease.",
