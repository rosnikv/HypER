        "abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the effect of periodized exercise training with and without Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in early postmenopausal women. Methods:A total of 128 women were randomly assigned to three subgroups: exercise (EG, n = 43), exercise and CR supplementation (EGCR, n = 43), and wellness control (control group [CG], n = 42). Both exercise groups performed a periodized exercise program with high-intensity-resistance/high-impact exercise dedicated to bone parameters interspersed by blocks of 10 weeks of training focusing on CHD parameters. In addition to the exercise program, the EGCR was supplemented with 40 mg/day of CR according to the specification of the manufacturer. A low-intensity exercise program of 60 minutes per week for a period of 10 weeks interspersed with 10-week blocks without exercise was performed in the CG. Primary endpoints were BMD and 10-year CHD risk proposed by Wilson. Secondary endpoints were body composition and menopausal symptoms. Results:BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained in both exercise groups (EG, \u22120.1% \u00b1 2.2%, P = 0.74; EGCR, \u22120.4% \u00b1 2.4%, P = 0.40) and significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the CG (2.0% \u00b1 2.0%). Both exercise groups significantly differed from the CG (P = 0.001 and 0.005 for the EG and EGCR, respectively); however, no differences between the exercise groups with and without CR was determined. Although slight increases in femoral neck BMD were determined in both exercise groups (EG, 0.5% \u00b1 3.0%, P = 0.36; EGCR, 0.4% \u00b1 3.1%, P = 0.52), a reduction was assessed in the CG (\u22120.6% \u00b1 2.7%, P = 0.29). No significant differences were determined between the groups. The 10-year CHD risk significantly increased in the EGCR (12.9% \u00b1 25.1%, P = 0.018) and in the CG (16.5% \u00b1 27.8%, P = 0.007). The EG did not show corresponding changes (\u22122.7% \u00b1 21.9%, P = 0.60). However, no significant between-group differences were observed. Conclusions:In conclusion our exercise program favorably affected bone, menopausal symptoms, lean body mass, and, to a smaller extent, 10-year CHD risk in early postmenopausal women. Adjuvant supplementation of CR did not enhance these positive effects.",

        "title": "Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOsteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue. Prevention of osteoporotic-related fractures is dependent on the ability to detect individuals with low bone mass, including those women who are asymptomatic. Treatment of osteoporosis involves the use of either anti-resorptive (e.g. estrogen and bisphosphonate) or bone formation agents (e.g. fluoride and PTH). The value of exercise as an intervention for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss is a controversial subject.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo examine the effectiveness of exercise therapy at preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry up to January 2000 according to the methods suggested by Dickersin et al and Haynes et al and the Cochrane Handbook. We hand searched reference lists and consulted content experts.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nThis review was proceeded by a peer reviewed protocol published in the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which met our predetermined inclusion criteria.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nThe same two reviewers abstracted the data using predetermined forms and assessed trial quality using a validated assessment tool. For dichotomous outcomes (fractures), relative risks were calculated using fixed effects models. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the percentage change from baseline were calculated. Where heterogeneity existed (determined by a chi square test), a random effects model was used.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nEighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. The trials had a mean methodological quality score of 2.53. Aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises were all effective on the BMD of the spine. The WMD for the combined aerobics and weight bearing program on the spine was 1.79 [95%CI (0.58, 3.01)]. The analyzed results showed walking to be effective on both BMD of the spine 1.31[95%CI (-0.03, 2.65) and the hip 0.92[95%CI (0.21, 1.64). Aerobic exercise was effective in increasing BMD of the wrist 1.22[95%CI (0.71, 1.74)].\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nAerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises are all effective in increasing the BMD of the spine in postmenopausal women. Walking is also effective on the hip. The quality of the reporting of the trials in the meta-analysis was low, in particular, in the areas of allocation concealement and blinding.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the long\u2010term dose\u2013response relationship of exercise frequency on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in early post\u2010menopausal women with osteopenia. Based on the 12\u2010year results of the consequently supervised exercise group (EG) of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study, we retrospectively structured two exercise groups according to the overall exercise frequency. Changes in aBMD at lumbar spine and proximal femur as assessed by dual\u2010energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry technique were compared between a low\u2010frequency exercise group (LEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200916) with 1.5\u2013<2 sessions/week and a high\u2010frequency exercise group (HEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200925) with \u22652\u20133.5 sessions/week. Changes in aBMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur were significantly more favorable in the HEF\u2010EG compared with the LEF\u2010EG; lumbar spine: (mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7% vs \u22124.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.001, ES: d'\u2009=\u20091.26; total hip: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs \u22126.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.045, ES: d'\u2009=\u20090.70). BMD results of the LEF\u2010EG did not significantly differ from the data of the non\u2010training control group (lumbar spine: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2%, total hip: \u22126.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0%). Although this result might not be generalizable across all exercise types and cohorts, it indicates that to impact bone, an overall exercise frequency of at least 2 sessions/week may be crucial, even if exercise is applied with high intensity/impact.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Multimorbidity related to menopause and/or increased age will put healthcare systems in western nations under ever-greater strain. Effective strategies to prevent diseases are thus of high priority and should be started earlier in life. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the long-term effect of exercise on different important health parameters in initially early postmenopausal women over a 16-year period. Methods: In 1998, 137 early postmenopausal women with osteopenia living in Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg were included in the study. Eighty-six women joined the exercise group (EG) and conducted two supervised group and two home training sessions per week, whereas the control group (CG: n\u200a=\u200a51) maintained their physical activity level. Primary outcome parameters were clinical overall fractures incidence; secondary study endpoint was Framingham study-based 10-year risk of coronary death/myocardial infarction and low back pain. Results: In 2014, 59 women of the EG and 46 women of the CG were included in the 16-year follow-up analysis. Framingham study-based 10-year risk of myocardial infarction/coronary death increased significantly (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) in both groups; however, changes were significantly more favorable in the EG (5.00%\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.94% vs CG: 6.90%\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.98%; P\u200a=\u200a0.02). The ratio for clinical \u201coverall\u201d fractures was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.24-0.92; P\u200a=\u200a0.03), and thus significantly lower in the EG. Although we focused on a high-intensity exercise strategy, low back pain was favorably affected in the EG. Conclusions: Multipurpose exercise programs demonstrated beneficial effects on various relevant risk factors and diseases of menopause or/and increased age, and should thus be preferentially applied for primary or secondary prevention in postmenopausal women.",

Materials and methods: The participants comprised 40 women aged 50\u201365 years who were divided into two randomly selected groups in training sessions (exercising group, n = 21 and control group, n = 19). A physical (grip, muscle and endurance) test and mental health test (simple mental health test II) were conducted using questionnaires with the aim of examining subjects\u2019 physical and mental health before and after exercise. Results: After the intervention, the participants experienced positive changes in the physical dimension, with significant enhancements particularly in mental well-being and menopause-related health and subdomains. Controlled and regular exercise for 12 weeks was significantly correlated with a positive change in vitality and mental health. Conclusions: We found that the SaBang-DolGi walking exercise program helps to promote the physical and mental health of menopausal women who are exposed to the various stresses and depressions that accompany physical deterioration; the program was found to encourage active and healthy aging.",
