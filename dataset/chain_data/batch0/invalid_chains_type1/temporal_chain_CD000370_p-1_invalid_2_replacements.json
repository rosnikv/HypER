        "title": "Safety of interferon \u03b2 treatment for chronic HCV hepatitis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In fact, chronic hepatitis C is considered as one of the primary causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the most common reason for liver transplantation. The primary objectives for the treatment of HCV-related chronic hepatitis is to eradicate infection and prevent progression of the disease. The treatment has evolved from the use of alpha-interferon (IFNalpha) alone to the combination of IFNalpha plus ribavirin, with a significant improvement in the overall efficacy, and to the newer PEG-IFNs which have further increased the virological response, used either alone or in combination with ribavirin. Despite these positive results, in terms of efficacy, concerns are related to the safety and adverse events. Many patients must reduce the dose of PEG-IFN or ribavirin, others must stop the treatment and a variable percentage of subjects are not suitable owing to intolerance toward drugs. IFNbeta represents a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and in some countries it plays an important role in therapeutic protocols. Aim of the present paper was to review available data on the safety of IFNbeta treatment in HCV-related chronic hepatitis. The rates of treatment discontinuation and/or dose modification due to the appearance of severe side effects during IFNbeta are generally low and in several clinical studies no requirements for treatment discontinuation and/or dose modifications have been reported. The most frequent side effects experienced during IFNbeta treatment are flu-like syndromes, fever, fatigue and injection-site reactions. No differences in terms of side-effect frequency and severity between responders and non-responders have been reported. A more recent study, performed to compare IFNbeta alone or in combination with ribavirin, confirmed the good safety profile of both treatments. Similar trends of adverse event frequency have been observed in subpopulations such as patients with genotype-1b HCV hepatitis unresponsive to IFNalpha treatment or with HCV-related cirrhosis and patients with acute viral hepatitis. If further studies will confirm the efficacy of combined IFNbeta and ribavirin treatment, this regimen could represent a safe and alternative therapeutic option in selected patients.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of recombinant human IFN \u03b2-1a alone or in combination with ribavirin in treatment-naive subjects with chronic hepatitis C. \n \nMETHODS: Open, randomized trial was performed in 6 Italian tertiary centers: 102 of the 108 patients screened were randomized to receive 6 MIU of recombinant human IFN \u03b2-1a subcutaneously daily for 24 wk, alone (Group 1, n = 51) or in combination with ribavirin 1 000 to 1 200 mg/d (Group 2, n = 51). \n \nRESULTS: The end-of-treatment virologic response rate was 29.4% in Group 1 and 41.2% in Group 2 (non-significant). Twenty-four weeks after stopping therapy, sustained virologic response rate was 21.6% in Group 1 and 27.4% in Group 2 (non-significant). All subjects in Group 1 completed treatment, while two subjects in Group 2 stopped therapy due to treatment-related adverse events. \n \nCONCLUSION: Recombinant human IFN \u03b2-1a, alone or in combination with ribavirin, has an excellent safety profile and, may represent an alternative for chronic hepatitis C patients who are unable to tolerate pegylated \u03b1-interferon.",

IFN beta is a potential alternative to IFN alpha. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and durability of IFN beta and its combination with ribavirin in the na\u00efve setting of chronic hepatitis C in Asian patients. In the initial randomized, double\u2010blind phase, patients with chronic hepatitis C (n = 257) received 12 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a, 44 \u03bcg subcutaneously 3 times weekly, or a placebo. In the subsequent open\u2010label phase, placebo nonresponders received 24 weeks of treatment with IFN beta\u20101a plus ribavirin, whereas patients receiving IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy received an additional 12 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome variable was SVR, which was defined as negative HCV RNA after weeks 24 and 48. A total of 34 of 128 patients (26.6%) receiving IFN beta\u20101a achieved an SVR versus 0 of 129 patients (0%) receiving the placebo (P < 0.001). In the IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin group, 73 of 127 patients (57.5%) achieved an SVR [P < 0.001 versus IFN beta\u20101a; the adjusted odds ratio was 4.54 (95% confidence interval: 2.53, 8.13)]. In HCV genotype 1 patients, 37 of 80 patients (46.3%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a/ribavirin achieved an SVR versus 19 of 85 patients (22.4%) treated with IFN beta\u20101a (P = 0.001). Conclusion: IFN beta\u20101a produced a clear antiviral effect in Asian patients with chronic HCV infection. The addition of ribavirin to IFN beta\u20101a significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved an SVR versus IFN beta\u20101a monotherapy. (HEPATOLOGY 2007.)",

        "abstract": "Background: With 170 million people infected worldwide and an inadequate current standard of care, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a major unmet medical need. Multiple companies are working on the discovery and development of specific HCV antiviral drugs, including inhibitors of HCV polymerase, protease and NS5A. Because of the error-prone nature of viral RNA replication, resistance mutants will develop that could present a potentially significant challenge to developing antiviral treatment regimens. Objective: Here, we review the major drug classes currently in preclinical and clinical development and the resistance mutations specific for each class that have been identified from cell culture and/or in vivo studies. Methods: We have analyzed currently available scientific literature to create a comprehensive review of the current state of the art in the field of HCV resistance to specific antiviral agents, in vitro and in vivo. Results/conclusion: Most specific HCV inhibitors described in the literature can select resistant viral variants in cell culture and in the clinic. Interplay of a mutant's fitness and its level of resistance will determine its clinical importance. Combinations of non-cross-resistant classes of dugs will be key to successful antiviral therapy. The number of drugs in a combination as well as the optimal duration of antiviral treatment, are important issues that need to be addressed in future studies.",

Inclusion criteria were type C hepatitis patients with HCV genotype 2a or 2b, > or = 70 years, and IFN-beta monotherapy of within 24 weeks. Thirty-one consecutive patients who satisfied the above criteria were enrolled in the present study. Independent factors that might have influenced the sustained virological response (SVR) were studied using logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBackground of clinical profiles was as follows: median (range) age = 71 (70-76) years, male/female = 13/18, and median (range) HCV-RNA = 260 (< 5-3,800) KIU/mL. Out of 31, 16 patients (51.6%) had SVR by the intention-to-treat analysis. The SVR was significantly associated with the serum HCV RNA level. Logistic analysis showed that SVR occurred when HCV RNA level was < 100 KIU/mL (p=0.020).

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is often present in postmenopausal women. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the cumulative incidence and predictive factors for bone fracture after cessation of interferon (IFN) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). A total of 420 postmenopausal women treated with IFN monotherapy were enrolled. The mean observation period was 7.2 years. The primary goal was the development of bone fracture. Evaluation was carried out by using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards analysis. Thirty\u2010one out of 420 patients sustained bone fracture. The cumulative development rate of bone fracture was 3.6% at 5th year, 9.2% at 10th year, and 17.4% at 15th year. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that bone fracture after cessation of IFN therapy occurred when histological staging of the liver was advanced (hazard ratio (HR): 2.54; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.21\u20135.31; P\u2009=\u20090.013), serum albumin level was\u2009<\u20093.5g/dl (HR: 2.25; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.10\u20134.59; P\u2009=\u20090.026), and virus clearance was not achieved (HR: 3.65; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.11\u201312.05; P\u2009=\u20090.033).
