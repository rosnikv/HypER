        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the effectiveness of high-intensity aerobic training compared with low-intensity training in terms of energy cost of locomotion, peak oxygen uptake, peak power, and self-reported physical function in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty children with JIA, ages 8-16 years, were enrolled in a randomized, single-blind controlled trial. Both groups participated in a 12-week, 3-times-weekly training program consisting of high-intensity aerobics in the experimental group and qigong in the control group. Subjects underwent exercise testing measuring submaximal oxygen uptake at 3 km/hour (VO(2submax)) as the primary outcome, maximal oxygen uptake, and peak power at the beginning and end of the program. Physical function was measured using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe exercise program was well tolerated in both groups. There was no difference in VO(2submax) or any other exercise testing measures between the groups through the study period and no indication of improvement. Both groups showed significant improvements in C-HAQ with no difference between the groups. Adherence was higher in the control group than the experimental group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings suggest that activity programs with or without an aerobic training component are safe and may result in an important improvement in physical function. The intensity of aerobic training did not seem to provide any additional benefits, but higher adherence in the qigong program may suggest that less intensive regimens are easier for children with JIA to comply with, and provide a degree of benefit equivalent to more intensive programs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExercise therapy is considered an important component of the treatment of arthritis. The efficacy of exercise therapy has been reviewed in adults with rheumatoid arthritis but not in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of exercise therapy on functional ability, quality of life and aerobic capacity in children with JIA.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2007), EMBASE (January 1966 to October 2007), PEDro (January 1966 to October 2007), SportDiscus (January 1966 to October 2007), Google Scholar (to October 2007), AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine) (January 1985 to October 2007), Health Technologies Assessment database (January 1988 to October 2007), ISI Web Science Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (January 1966 to October 2007) and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website (http://www.cps.uk.org) were searched and references tracked.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise treatment in JIA.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nPotentially relevant references were evaluated and all data were extracted by two review authors working independently.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThree out of 16 identified studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 212 participants. All the included studies fulfilled at least seven of 10 methodological criteria. The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08), quality of life (CHQ-PhS: n = 115; WMD -3.96, 95% CI -8.91 to 1.00) and aerobic capacity (n = 124; WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.19). The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant. None of the studies reported negative effects of the exercise therapy.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nOverall, based on 'silver-level' evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy can improve functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity or pain. The low number of available RCTs limits the generalisability. The included and excluded studies were all consistent about the adverse effects of exercise therapy; no short-term detrimental effects of exercise therapy were found in any study. Both included and excluded studies showed that exercise does not exacerbate arthritis. The large heterogeneity in outcome measures, as seen in this review, emphasises the need for a standardised assessment or a core set of functional and physical outcome measurements suited for health research to generate evidence about the possible benefits of exercise therapy for patients with JIA. Although the short-term effects look promising, the long-term effect of exercise therapy remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "AIM\nSince 2007 we have been focusing our attention to EJPRM as the best available clinical evidence as offered by the Cochrane Collaboration. Due to the absence of a specific Rehabilitation Group (only a Field does exist), some reviews in the field of PRM are not easy to find. Consequently, the EJPRM lists and presents all these reviews systematically. The aim of the present paper is to systematically review all the new papers in the field of rehabilitation published in the 3rd Issue of 2009 from the Cochrane Library in order to provide physicians a summary of the best updated evidence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors systematically searched all the new papers of on rehabilitation from the 3rd Issue 2009 of the Cochrane Library. The retrieved papers have been divided in subgroups on the base of theirs topic and the Cochrane Groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of included papers was 18, 14 of them being new reviews, 7 new reviews dealing with neurological rehabilitation, 4 dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, 3 dealing with pain management. In addition, 4 reviews have been updated, 1 in the field of musculoskeletal disorders, 2 on neuromuscular disorders, and 1 on elderly rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Library are two important instruments to improve evidence-based medicine (EBM) in medical practice and in the field of rehabilitation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present paper can help rehabilitation specialists to retrieve the findings of the most relevant and updated reviews in order to better their clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "It is not known to what extent exercise programs increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in patients with coronary heart diseases (CHD). The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of exercise interventions on VO2max in subjects with CHD. Database search of randomized controlled trials was conducted from PubMed. Studies were included that reported the characteristics and effects of exercise interventions in subjects with CHD, included a non\u2010exercise control group and measured VO2max using direct measurement method. Eighteen studies were eligible. Exercise interventions increased VO2max by 2.6 \u00b1 1.6 and 0.3 \u00b1 1.4\u2003mL/kg/min in the training and control groups, respectively. The net difference in the change of VO2max between the groups was 2.3\u2003mL/kg/min with a standardized mean difference of 0.60 [95% CI 0.47, 0.74] (P<0.001). Aerobic training led to a larger difference in VO2max between the groups than other training modes. Over 6 months of training period and training started within 3 months after a cardiac event also had a significant effect on VO2max. This analysis showed that a long exercise training period starting soon after a cardiac event improved VO2max in patients with CHD most effectively. In future studies, the training programs should be designed carefully as even larger improvements in VO2max may be possible.",

        "abstract": "Introduction The prescription of physical activity for hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) can be complicated by the presence of comorbidities. The current research aimed to synthesize the relevant literature on the benefits of exercise for people with multimorbidities who experience an AECOPD, and ask: What are the parameters and outcomes of exercise in AECOPD and in conditions that are common comorbidities as reported by systematic reviews (SRs)? Methods An SR was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration protocol. Nine electronic databases were searched up to July 2011. Articles were included if they (1) described participants with AECOPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or one of eleven common comorbidities, (2) were an SR, (3) examined aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), balance training (BT), or a combination thereof, (4) included at least one outcome of fitness, and (5) compared exercise training versus control/sham. Results This synthesis examined 58 SRs of exercise training in people with AECOPD, COPD, or eleven chronic conditions commonly associated with COPD. Meta-analyses of endurance (aerobic or exercise capacity, 6-minute walk distance \u2013 6MWD) were shown to significantly improve in most conditions (except osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and depression), whereas strength was shown to improve in five of the 13 conditions searched: COPD, older adults, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes. Several studies of different conditions also reported improvements in quality of life, function, and control or prevention outcomes. Meta-analyses also demonstrate that exercise training decreases the risk of mortality in older adults, and those with COPD or ischemic heart disease. The most common types of training were AT and RT. BT and functional training were commonly applied in older adults. The quality of the SRs for most conditions was moderate to excellent (>65%) as evaluated by AMSTAR scores. Conclusion In summary, this synthesis showed evidence of significant benefits from exercise training in AECOPD, COPD, and conditions that are common comorbidities. A broader approach to exercise and activity prescription in pulmonary rehabilitation may induce therapeutic benefits to ameliorate clinical sequelae associated with AECOPD and comorbidities such as the inclusion of BT and functional training.",

        "abstract": "In heart transplant (HTx) recipients, there has been reluctance to recommend high\u2010intensity interval training (HIIT) due to denervation and chronotropic impairment of the heart. We compared the effects of 12 weeks' HIIT versus continued moderate exercise (CON) on exercise capacity and chronotropic response in stable HTx recipients >12 months after transplantation in a randomized crossover trial. The study was completed by 16 HTx recipients (mean age 52 years, 75% males). Baseline peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was 22.9\u2009mL/kg/min. HIIT increased VO2peak by 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7\u2009mL/min/kg (17%) and CON by 2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009mL/kg/min (10%) (significantly higher in HIIT; p\u2009<\u20090.001). During HIIT, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.037) with no significant change in CON (p\u2009=\u20090.241; between group difference p\u2009=\u20090.027). Peak heart rate (HRpeak) increased significantly by 4.3\u2009beats per minute (p\u2009=\u20090.014) after HIIT with no significant change in CON (p\u2009=\u20090.34; between group difference p\u2009=\u20090.027). Heart rate recovery (HRrecovery) improved in both groups with a trend toward greater improvement after HIIT. The 5\u2010month washout showed a significant loss of improvement. HIIT was well tolerated, had a superior effect on oxygen uptake, and led to an unexpected increase in HRpeak accompanied by a faster HRrecovery. This indicates that the benefits of HIIT are partly a result of improved chronotropic response.",

        "abstract": "AIM To identify the outcome measures that have been used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise training in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and to link these outcomes to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. METHODS Electronic literature searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science were performed. We sought RCTs that investigated the effect of exercise training in SOT recipients. Reference lists of all eligible publications were searched for other appropriate studies not identified by the electronic search. A complete list of outcome measures used in the RCTs was generated and each of these was linked to an ICF category. RESULTS Four hundred and thirteen articles were retrieved, of which 35 met our inclusion criteria. The studies included were designed to compare the effects of exercise training programs to usual care or to another exercise training program and reported on recipients of heart (n = 21), kidney (n = 9), lung (n = 3) or liver (n = 2) transplant. Of the 126 outcome measures identified, 62 were used as primary outcome measures. The most commonly occurring primary outcomes were aerobic capacity using the peak VO2 (n = 13), quality of life using the short-form-36 (n = 8), and muscle strength (n = 7). These outcome measures were linked to 113 ICF categories and the majority of outcomes fall into the body function domain (n = 93). CONCLUSION There is little standardization in outcome measures used in RCTs of exercise interventions in SOT recipients. The ICF framework can be used to select a core set of outcomes that cross all domains of ICF and that would be appropriate to all SOT recipients.",

        "title": "Importance of physical capacity and the effects of exercise in heart transplant recipients",
        "abstract": "One of the most important prognostic factors in heart failure patients is physical capacity. Patients with very poor physical performance and otherwise eligible, may be listed as candidates for heart transplantation (HTx). After such surgery, life-long immunosuppression therapy is needed to prevent rejection of the new heart. The dark side of immunosuppression is the increased risk of infections, kidney failure, cancer and advanced atherosclerosis (cardiac allograft vasculopathy), with the two latter conditions as the main causes of later mortality. In a worldwide perspective, 50% of the HTx patients survive past 10 years. Poor aerobic capacity prior to graft deterioration is not only limited to the failing heart, but also caused by peripheral factors, such as limited function in the skeletal muscles and in the blood vessels walls. Exercise rehabilitation after HTx is of major importance in order to improve physical capacity and prognosis. Effects of high-intensity interval training (HIT) in HTx recipients is a growing field of research attracting worldwide focus and interest. Accumulating evidence has shown that HIT is safe and efficient in maintenance HTx recipients; with superior effects on physical capacity compared to conventional moderate exercise. This article generates further evidence to the field by summarizing results from a decade of research performed at our center supported by a broad, but not strict formal, literature review. In short, this article demonstrates a strong association between physical capacity measured after HTx and long-term survival. It describes the possible \u201cHIT-effect\u201d with increased levels of inflammatory mediators of angiogenesis. It also describes long-term effects of HIT; showing a positive effect in development of anxiety symptoms despite that the improved physical capacity was not sustained, due to downregulation of exercise and intensity. Finally, our results are linked to the ongoing HITTS study, which investigates safety and efficiency of HIT in de novo HTx recipients. Together with previous results, this study may have the potential to change existing guidelines and contribute to a better prognosis for the HTx population as a whole.",

While LVADs implantation does effectively improve hemodynamic performance many patients still possess peripheral pathological adaptations often present in end-stage HF. Therefore, increased attention has been placed on investigating the effects of exercise training for patients with LVADs to improve clinical outcomes. However, the available evidence on exercise training for patients with LVADs is limited. Areas covered: The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize: 1) The evolution of LVAD technology and usage; 2) The physiological responses to exercise in patients with LVADs; 3) The available evidence regarding exercise training; 4) Potential strategies to implement exercise training programs for this patient population. Expert opinion: The available evidence for exercise training to improve physical function and clinical outcomes for patients with LVADs is promising but limited. Future research is needed to further elucidate the ideal exercise training parameters, method of delivery for exercise training, and unique barriers and facilitators to exercise training for patients receiving LVAD implantation.",
