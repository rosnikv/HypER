        "title": "Recombinant factor VIIa for variceal bleeding in patients with advanced cirrhosis: A randomized, controlled trial",
        "abstract": "A beneficial effect of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in Child\u2010Pugh class B and C patients with cirrhosis who have variceal bleeding has been suggested. This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in patients with advanced cirrhosis and active variceal bleeding. At 31 hospitals in an emergency setting, 256 patients (Child\u2010Pugh > 8; Child\u2010Pugh B = 26%, C = 74%) were randomized equally to: placebo; 600 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa (200 + 4\u00d7 100 \u03bcg/kg); or 300 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa (200 + 100 \u03bcg/kg). Dosing was intravenous at 0, 2, 8, 14, and 20 hours after endoscopy, in addition to standard vasoactive, prophylactic antibiotic, and endoscopic treatment. The primary composite endpoint consisted of failure to control 24\u2010hour bleeding, or failure to prevent rebleeding or death at day 5. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and 42\u2010day mortality. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Administration of rFVIIa had no significant effect on the composite endpoint compared with placebo (P = 0.37). There was no significant difference in 5\u2010day mortality between groups; however, 42\u2010day mortality was significantly lower with 600 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa compared with placebo (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.13\u20130.74), and bleeding\u2010related deaths were reduced from 12% (placebo) to 2% (600 \u03bcg/kg). A marked heterogeneity in the failure rate in all treatment groups was observed across participating centers. Adverse events, including overall thromboembolic events, were comparable between groups. Conclusion: Treatment with rFVIIa had no significant effect on the primary composite endpoint compared with placebo. Therefore, decision on the use of this hemostatic agent in acute variceal bleeding should be carefully considered, because results of this study do not support the routine use of rFVIIa in this setting. Adverse events were comparable across groups. (HEPATOLOGY 2008.)",

        "title": "The use of recombinant activated factor VIIa in coagulopathic traumatic brain injuries requiring emergent craniotomy: is it beneficial?",
        "abstract": "Object. The role of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been well established. This study evaluates the outcomes of using rFVIIa as first-line therapy in patients with a severe TBI requiring emergent craniotomy that are coagulopathic. Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed patients admitted between 2003 and 2006 to a Level I trauma center with a severe TBI requiring an emergency craniotomy. Eighteen patients with coagulopathy that was corrected using rFVIIa were identified. Variables evaluated included age, injury severity score, head abbreviated injury score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, international normalized ratio, time to operation, operative procedure, thromboembolic events, and death. Results. The cohort consisted of 18 patients, predominantly male (55.6%) with a mean age of 80.5 years. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall. Coagulopathy was due to premorbid anticoagulants in 50% of the cohort. Time from admission to operation was 130 minutes. Coagulopathy reversal was complete in all 18 cases (100%). A high mortality rate (55.6%) was attributed to a high incidence of withdrawal of care (50%). The incidence of thromboembolic events was low (5.6%). Survivors, when compared with nonsurvivors, had a > 3-fold increase in postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale score for similar preoperative scores. A good functional outcome was achieved in 75% of survivors with a mean follow-up period of 4.2 months. Conclusions. The use of rFVIIa in the correction of coagulopathy in patients having sustained severe TBI requiring emergency craniotomy appears to be safe and effective even among the elderly. This allows a shorter transit time to craniotomy. Its effects on mortality and long-term neurological outcome requires further investigation prospectively.

        "title": "Insertion of Intracranial Pressure Monitors in Fulminant Hepatic Failure Patients: Early Experience Using Recombinant Factor VII",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCerebral edema contributes to the high morbidity and mortality of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). OBJECTIVEWe report the results of our early experience with insertion of intraparenchymal intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors in these highly coagulopathic patients. METHODSEleven consecutive patients with FHF met the criteria for invasive ICP monitoring. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) was administered at an average dose of 3 mg intravenous bolus (average, 36.7 \u03bcg/kg). We inserted the intraparenchymal ICP monitor within 15 minutes to 2 hours after rFVIIa administration, without waiting for the repeat coagulation results. Postprocedure computed tomographic scans of the brain were obtained in all patients. RESULTSNo hemorrhagic complications were detected on the immediate postprocedure computed tomographic scans. There were no thrombotic complications in this group of patients. CONCLUSIONIn this group of patients with FHF, placement of an ICP monitor without hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications was feasible after administration of rFVIIa. This is a report of our early experience, and caution is advised. Further collaborative randomized studies are needed to prove the efficacy, optimal dosing, and cost effectiveness of rFVIIa for the placement of ICP monitors in this group of patients.",
