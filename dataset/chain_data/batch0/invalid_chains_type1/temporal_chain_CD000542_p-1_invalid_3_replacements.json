        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory disorders and commonly presents during childhood or adolescence. Occurring during a critical period of growth and development, pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis require special consideration. Children often experience growth failure, malnutrition, pubertal delay and bone demineralization. Medical treatment must be optimized to promote clinical improvement and reverse growth failure with minimal toxicity. In addition to pharmacologic and surgical interventions, nutritional therapies play a vital role in the management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This review will outline the epidemiology and clinical complications that are unique to pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, current trends, and recent advances in nutritional and pharmacologic treatment, and projected future therapeutic direction.",

        "title": "Gene Expression Profiling and Network Analysis Reveals Lipid and Steroid Metabolism to Be the Most Favored by TNF\u03b1 in HepG2 Cells",
        "abstract": "Background The proinflammatory cytokine, TNF\u03b1, is a crucial mediator of the pathogenesis of several diseases, more so in cases involving the liver wherein it is critical in maintaining liver homeostasis since it is a major determiner of hepatocyte life and death. Gene expression profiling serves as an appropriate strategy to unravel the underlying signatures to envisage such varied responses and considering this, gene transcription profiling was examined in control and TNF\u03b1 treated HepG2 cells. Methods and Findings Microarray experiments between control and TNF\u03b1 treated HepG2 cells indicated that TNF\u03b1 could significantly alter the expression profiling of 140 genes; among those up-regulated, several GO (Gene Ontology) terms related to lipid and fat metabolism were significantly (p<0.01) overrepresented indicating a global preference of fat metabolism within the hepatocyte and those within the down-regulated dataset included genes involved in several aspects of the immune response like immunoglobulin receptor activity and IgE binding thereby indicating a compromise in the immune defense mechanism(s). Conserved transcription factor binding sites were identified in identically clustered genes within a common GO term and SREBP-1 and FOXJ2 depicted increased occupation of their respective binding elements in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The interacting network of \u201clipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry\u201d was derived to be significantly overrepresented that correlated well with the top canonical pathway of \u201cbiosynthesis of steroids\u201d. Conclusions TNF\u03b1 alters the transcriptome profiling within HepG2 cells with an interesting catalog of genes being affected and those involved in lipid and steroid metabolism to be the most favored. This study represents a composite analysis of the effects of TNF\u03b1 in HepG2 cells that encompasses the altered transcriptome profiling, the functional analysis of the up- and down- regulated genes and the identification of conserved transcription factor binding sites. These could possibly determine TNF\u03b1 mediated alterations mainly the phenotypes of hepatic steatosis and fatty liver associated with several hepatic pathological states.",

        "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections are a major threat for patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency caused by a defect in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase. Interestingly, Aspergillus (Emericella) nidulans is the second most encountered mold in CGD patients, causing almost exclusively invasive infections in this specific host, and is characterized by its aggressive behavior. A proper diagnosis is complicated by the often mild clinical presentation, the low sensitivity of the currently used diagnostic tools, and the difficulties in accurate identification of the Emericella species. According to the hitherto accepted view on the role of the NADPH-oxidase in the innate host-defense pathway, the pathogenesis of A. nidulans in CGD cannot be explained. This synopsis covers the current understanding of invasive infections caused by A. nidulans in the CGD patient and is intended to direct further research by indicating gaps in our knowledge and to guide optimal management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Invasive aspergillosis is a major threat to patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Fungal pathogenesis is the result of a diminished antifungal capacity and dysregulated inflammation. A deficient NADPH-oxidase complex results in defective phagolysosomal alkalization. To investigate the contribution of defective pH regulation in phagocytes among patients with CGD during fungal pathogenesis, we evaluated the effect of the acidotropic, antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) on the antifungal capacity of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and on the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Chloroquine exerted a direct pH-dependent antifungal effect on Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans; it increased the antifungal activity of PMNs from patients with CGD at a significantly lower concentration, compared with the concentration for PMNs from healthy individuals; and decreased the hyperinflammatory state of PBMCs from patients with CGD, as observed by decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 1\u03b2 release. Chloroquine targets both limbs of fungal pathogenesis and might be of great value in the clearance of invasive aspergillosis in patients with CGD.",

        "title": "NOX2-dependent regulation of inflammation.",
        "abstract": "NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms together have multiple functions that are important for normal physiology and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2) is critical for antimicrobial host defence. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder of NOX2 characterized by severe life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and by excessive inflammation, including Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NOX2 defends against microbes through the direct antimicrobial activity of reactive oxidants and through activation of granular proteases and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETosis involves the breakdown of cell membranes and extracellular release of chromatin and neutrophil granular constituents that target extracellular pathogens. Although the immediate effects of oxidant generation and NETosis are predicted to be injurious, NOX2, in several contexts, limits inflammation and injury by modulation of key signalling pathways that affect neutrophil accumulation and clearance. NOX2 also plays a role in antigen presentation and regulation of adaptive immunity. Specific NOX2-activated pathways such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional factor that induces antioxidative and cytoprotective responses, may be important therapeutic targets for CGD and, more broadly, diseases associated with excessive inflammation and injury.",

        "title": "Inhibition of SREBP With Fatostatin Does Not Attenuate Early Diabetic Nephropathy in Male Mice",
        "abstract": "Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is an important potential mediator of kidney fibrosis and is known to be upregulated in diabetic nephropathy. We evaluated the effectiveness of SREBP inhibition as treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Type 1 diabetes was induced in uninephrectomized male CD1 mice with streptozotocin. The mice were treated with the SREBP inhibitor fatostatin for 12 weeks. At the endpoint, kidney function and pathologic findings were assessed. Fatostatin inhibited the increase of both isoforms of SREBP (types 1 and 2) in diabetic kidneys. Treatment attenuated basement membrane thickening but did not improve hyperfiltration, albuminuria, or kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice. The treatment of nondiabetic mice with fatostatin led to hyperfiltration and increased the glomerular volume to levels seen in diabetic mice. This was associated with increased renal inflammation and a trend toward increased renal fibrosis. Both in vivo and in cultured renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, fatostatin increased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Thus, SREBP inhibition with fatostatin not only is ineffective in preventing diabetic nephropathy but also leads to kidney injury in nondiabetic mice. Further research on the efficacy of other SREBP inhibitors and the specific roles of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in the treatment and pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is needed.",

        "title": "A Biomimetic Polymer Magnetic Nanocarrier Polarizing Tumor-Associated Macrophages for Potentiating Immunotherapy.",
        "abstract": "The progress of antitumor immunotherapy is usually limited by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that account for the highest proportion of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, and the TAMs can also be reversed by modulating the M2-like phenotype. Herein, a biomimetic polymer magnetic nanocarrier is developed with selectively targeting and polarizing TAMs for potentiating immunotherapy of breast cancer. This nanocarrier PLGA-ION-R837\u200a@\u200aM (PIR\u200a@\u200aM) is achieved, first, by the fabrication of magnetic polymer nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating Fe3 O4 NPs and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist imiquimod (R837) and, second, by the coating of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-\u200atreated macrophage membranes on the surface of the NPs for targeting TAMs. The intracellular uptake of the PIR\u200a@\u200aM can greatly polarize TAMs from M2 to antitumor M1 phenotype with the synergy of Fe3 O4 NPs and R837. The relevant mechanism of the polarization is deeply studied through analyzing the mRNA expression of the signaling pathways. Different from previous reports, the polarization is ascribed to the fact that Fe3 O4 NPs mainly activate the IRF5 signaling pathway via iron ions instead of the reactive oxygen species-induced NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. The anticancer effect can be effectively enhanced through potentiating immunotherapy by the polarization of the TAMs in the combination of Fe3 O4 NPs and R837.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Cancer vaccine therapy is promising, though its efficacy is compromised in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have the potential to be repolarized to an antitumor subtype, and their antigen-presenting ability might enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccination. Here, we aimed to develop a nanoparticle with adjuvant effect that could be a carrier for neoantigen-based vaccine to target and repolarize TAMs in situ. Therefore, we prepared a hyaluronic acid and mannose dual-modified iron oxide nanoparticle, and the enhanced efficiency of nanoparticle intake of macrophages was confirmed. It could repolarize macrophages and outperformed a commercialized iron oxide nanoparticle, ferumoxytol. Combined with peptides, this nanoparticle strongly inhibited TC1 tumor growth, and 40% of mice reached complete regression. This is the first report using mannose, hyaluronic acid, and iron oxide to target TAMs and achieve ideal outcomes in vivo. This study provides a facile nanoplatform for neoantigen-based vaccine therapy and a reference for repolarizing TAMs to promote immunotherapy. Abstract Neoantigen-based cancer vaccine therapy is a breakthrough in the field of immunotherapy. However, it is difficult for vaccines against neoantigens to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, where tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a significant role. Herein, we report an iron oxide nanoparticle modified with hyaluronic acid and mannose to reshape the tumor microenvironment by targeting and repolarizing TAMs from protumor M2 to antitumor M1 phenotype. Mannose decoration could confer the nanoparticle-enhanced TAM targeting ability, while hyaluronic acid and iron oxide could repolarize M2-like macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combined with antigenic peptides, this nanovaccine could significantly increase the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor tissue and strongly activate dendritic cells in sentinel lymph nodes. Finally, we used the dual-modified nanoparticles to first convert the tumor microenvironment and then the nanovaccine administration in a TC1 tumor model to further enhance efficacy. This strategy inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 40% cure rate in mice (two of five). In summary, this study provides a potent and rationally designed nanoadjuvant to enhance antitumor efficiency and facilitate delivery of neoantigen vaccines by repolarizing TAMs and harmonizing immune cells.",

        "abstract": "Adoptive cell immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cells therapy, has made great progress in the clinical treatment of hematological malignancies. However, restricted by the complex tumor microenvironment, the potential efficiency of T-cell infiltration and activated immune cells are limited, thus failure prevented the progression of the solid tumor. Alternatively, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), one sustentacular and heterogeneous cellular population within the tumor microenvironment, are regarded as potential therapeutic targets. Recently, CARs have shown tremendous promise in treating malignancies by equipping macrophages. This novel therapeutic strategy circumvents the tumor microenvironment\u2019s limitations and provides a safer therapeutic approach. Meanwhile, nanobiomaterials as gene delivery carriers not only substantially reduce the treatment cost of this novel therapeutic strategy, but also set the foundation for in vivo CAR-M therapy. Here, we highlight the major strategies prepared for CAR-M, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities of these approaches. First, the common therapeutic strategies for macrophages are summarized in clinical and preclinical trials. Namely, TAM-targeted therapeutic strategies: 1) Inhibit monocyte or macrophage recruitment into tumors, 2) deplete TAMs, and 3) reprogramme TAMs to antitumor M1 phenotype. Second, the current development and progress of CAR-M therapy are reviewed, including the researchers\u2019 attempts in CAR structure design, cell origin, and gene delivery vectors, especially nanobiomaterials as an alternative to viral vectors, as well as some challenges faced by current CAR-M therapy are also summarized and discussed. Finally, the field of genetically engineered macrophages integration with nanotechnology for the future in oncology has been prospected.",

However, CAR-T cells have the limited efficacy of against solid tumors. To address these limitations, CAR-macrophages (CAR-Ms) leverage the innate properties of macrophages with the specificity and potency of CAR technology, offering a novel and promising approach to cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical studies have shown that CAR-Ms can effectively target and destroy tumor cells, even within challenging microenvironments, by exhibiting direct cytotoxicity and enhancing the recruitment and activation of other immune cells. Additionally, the favorable safety profile of macrophages and their persistence within solid tumors position CAR-Ms as potentially safer and more durable therapeutic options compared to CAR-T cells. This review explores recent advancements in CAR-Ms technology, including engineering strategies to optimize their anti-tumor efficacy and preclinical evidence supporting their use. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in developing CAR-Ms therapies, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize cellular immunotherapy.
