        "title": "Mulberry leaf extract reduces postprandial hyperglycemia with few side effects by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase in normal rats.",
        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf extract (MLE) was investigated as a potent plant-derived \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor with low \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. MLE was prepared by heating in an autoclave at 121 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, and its in vitro and in vivo antihyperglycemic activities were investigated. The adverse side effects of MLE were analyzed by measuring the weight and volume of the cecum, stool color, starch content in the cecum, and the integrity of intestinal transporting capacity. The in vitro inhibitory activity of MLE on intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase was potent and that on intestinal \u03b1-amylase was very weak compared with acarbose. Sugar loading tests with starch, maltose, and sucrose showed that MLE may reduce postprandial increases in blood glucose by acting as an intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Feeding tests suggested that MLE may exhibit fewer adverse side effects than other \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, such as abdominal flatulence and meteorism, which are attributed to the impaired digestion of starch by strong inhibition of intestinal \u03b1-amylase. These results suggest that MLE could be used in the development of pharmaceutical foods to control the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients by inhibiting intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase with reduced side effects.",

        "title": "Comparison of inhibitory activities and mechanisms of five mulberry plant bioactive components against \u03b1-glucosidase.",
        "abstract": "The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of five bioactive components, namely 1-deoxynojirimycin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol contained in mulberry (Morus, Moraceae) plants have been compared. Spectroscopy methods were employed to compare their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory mechanisms. The results revealed that 1-deoxynojirimycin (competitive), resveratrol and oxyresveratrol (noncompetitive) were stronger inhibitors than acarbose, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (mix competitive and noncompetitive) showed modest activities. 1-Deoxynojirimycin, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol could quench the fluorescence spectra statically by forming stable complexes, while the quenching of cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside belonged to dynamic quenching by the collision of molecules. The interactions between ligands and \u03b1-glucosidase were mainly driven by hydrophobic force, or hydrogen bonding consequently induced conformational changes and reduced surface hydrophobicity. Docking results suggested that they could bind to \u03b1-glucosidase at different sites. This work provides useful information for the understanding of the ligands-\u03b1-glucosidase interactions and identifies oxyresveratrol as a potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor.",

        "title": "Naturally occurring Batatasins and their derivatives as \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors",
        "abstract": "Batatasins are endogenous plant hormones found in yams and other related plant species. These plants are widely consumed as botanical dietary supplements in many parts of the world. This study investigated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of Batatasin I, III, IV, V against \u03b1-glucosidase regarding their antidiabetic activities. The results revealed that Batatasin I, III, IV inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase in a reversible and noncompetitive manner, with IC50 values of 2.55, 1.89 and 2.52 mM respectively, while Batatasin V completely abolished its inhibitory activity even at the highest concentrations tested. Furthermore, a class of Batatasin-derived compounds with different substitution patterns was synthesized and subjected to the assay to clarify the structure\u2013activity relationships, which suggested that the hydroxyl at the C-2\u2032 position may play a significant role in improving the inhibitory activities. Their probable binding modes and the specificity of the binding sites were studied using molecule docking simulation. It was concluded that Batatasins, especially Batatasin III and IV, are promising \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, which therefore could be used as functional food to alleviate postprandial hyperglycemia and as potential candidates for the development of antidiabetic agents.",

        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) fruit has a high yield in one fruiting season in many countries, especially in Asia, and a long history of use as an edible fruit and traditional medicine. A great diversity of nutritive compounds such as fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds, including anthocyanins, rutin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and polysaccharides have been found in mulberry fruit depending on the cultivars and maturity stages. Furthermore, the extracts and active components of mulberry fruit have demonstrated numerous biological activities, including antioxidant, neuroprotective, antiatherosclerosis, immunomodulative, antitumor, antihyperglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities in in vitro and in vivo studies, and they have received increasing interest from researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Although some mechanistic studies further substantiate these potential health benefits of mulberry fruit, a need exists to make a better understanding of the roles of these compounds in traditional medicine and the diet. This review provides recent findings regarding the chemical constituents and biological activities of mulberry fruit, which may be useful for stimulating deep research of mulberry fruit and for predicting their uses as important and safe contributors to benefit human health.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the Chemical Composition and Antioxidant Activity of Mulberry (Morus alba L.) Fruits from Different Varieties in China",
        "abstract": "Mulberry (Morus alba L.) fruit is a fruit with nutritional and medicinal value. It is widely cultivated in different regions of China, which may result in differences in its chemical composition. In this research, 25 mulberry fruit samples from six provinces in China were investigated. The contents of anthocyanins were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of two main anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (C3R), ranged from 0.656 \u00b1 0.006 mg/g to 4.367 \u00b1 0.243 mg/g and from 0.226 \u00b1 0.007 mg/g to 1.649 \u00b1 0.013 mg/g, respectively. Additionally, the contents of total phenolic, total flavonoid, vitamin C, titratable acids, reducing sugars and antioxidant capacity (FRAP, DPPH, scavenging and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity) were also assessed. The results and principal component analysis showed that the Zhongsang 5801 variety from Sichuan, Dechang had the greatest health value with the highest active compound contents. Based on our analysis, the variety from Sichuan, Dechang is a high-quality plant source for mulberry fruit cultivation. This research provides a basis for the rational development and utilization of mulberry fruit resources in China.",

        "title": "Effect of vacuum freeze drying and hot air drying on dried mulberry fruit quality",
        "abstract": "Two different drying methods (vacuum freeze-drying and hot-air drying) were used to dry mulberry of three varieties \u2019Baiyuwang\u2019(D1), \u2019Longsang\u2019(D2) and \u2019Zhongshen.1\u2019(D3), and the fresh fruit of each variety was used as the control. The effects of different processing conditions on the physical characteristics, nutrients, functional components and antioxidant activity of mulberry fruit were analyzed. The results show that after different drying methods, after vacuum freeze-drying, the physical properties of dried mulberry fruit such as wettability, hygroscopic property and water retention, soluble protein, ascorbic acid and other nutrients, functional components such as polyphenols, resveratrol, chlorogenic acid and anthocyanin, and antioxidant activities such as DPPH free radical scavenging ability and ABTS free radical scavenging ability were superior to hot air drying (P < 0.01). It was concluded that vacuum freeze drying was more beneficial for retaining the original quality of mulberry than hot air drying. This study can provide a retaining theoretical basis for mulberry deep processing and comprehensive development and utilization.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on mitigating the decrease in the quality of mulberry after harvest and increasing the value of mulberry products through microwave vacuum drying. The effects of mulberry moisture content on texture properties were investigated, and the test method was optimized through the membership function model and the central composite technique. The influences of the material surface temperature, vacuum degree, and microwave power on the quality of instant mulberry were analyzed comprehensively. A regression model was established to analyze the relationship between each test factor and quality index. The results show that, with increases in the moisture content, both the hardness and chewiness of mulberry present a decreasing trend; when elasticity increases gradually, adhesivity is presented in an inverted V-shaped variation trend, and the cohesiveness remains basically constant. Moreover, the moisture content of mulberry had significant correlations with elasticity, glueyness, chewiness, and hardness (R2 > 0.9). When the moisture content of the samples reached \u226444.07%, the total plate count reached a minimum and changed gradually; thus, the moisture content (44.07%) of mulberry was determined for the technological optimization test. The combination of optimal technological parameters was as follows: material surface temperature = 51.0 \u00b0C, vacuum degree = 0.07 MPa, and microwave power = 370 W. Under these optimal technological parameters, the soluble solid content was 42.37%, chewiness was 9.08, and the Vc content was 0.725 mg\u00b7(100 g)\u22121. The average error between the test results and software optimization parameters was 5.88%. The optimized microwave vacuum drying technological parameters improved the drying quality of mulberry significantly. The results can provide theoretical support for the microwave vacuum drying of berries.",
