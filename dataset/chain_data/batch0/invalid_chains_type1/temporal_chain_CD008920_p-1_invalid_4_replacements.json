        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) in the treatment of depression in 191 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study. A placebo washout period of 3-7 days was followed by an 8 week active treatment phase during which patients received either paroxetine (20-40 mg daily) or amitriptyline (75-150 mg daily). The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at endpoint.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParoxetine was as effective as amitriptyline for the treatment of depression, with similar improvements in RA associated pain and disability also seen in both groups. However, paroxetine was better tolerated than amitriptyline, with an overall frequency of adverse experiences of 56.4% and 67.7% in the 2 groups, respectively. The frequency of anticholinergic adverse experiences was much lower in the paroxetine treatment group (18.1% vs 43.8% taking amitriptyline) and paroxetine treated patients also experienced fewer severe (16.0% vs 21.9%), serious nonfatal (0% vs 4.2%), and drug related adverse experiences (12.8% vs 29.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTolerability is an important consideration in this patient population, which is largely composed of elderly patients who are taking additional medications for RA. Paroxetine shows a number of advantages in the management of depression comorbid with RA.",

        "title": "Depressive Symptoms and Mortality Risk in a National Sample: Confounding Effects of Health Status",
        "abstract": "Objective: We examined the association between depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality in a population sample. Published findings on the relation between depressive symptoms and mortality risk point to an inconsistent association and one that is likely influenced by health status. Few studies have assessed this relation in randomly selected population samples. Methods: Participants were 3617 noninstitutionalized adults, age 25 years or older, from the Americans\u2019 Changing Lives Study, an ongoing longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 11-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the relative risk of mortality as a function of the CES-D scores at baseline. Results: In 7.5 years of follow-up, 542 deaths occurred. Each 1-standard unit increase on the CES-D predicted a 21% increased risk of all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, gender, and race (hazard ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval = 1.08 to 1.36, p = .001). This association was weakened somewhat following adjustment for education, income, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption (hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval = 0.99 to 1.28, p = .06). However, control for self-reported functional limitations or chronic health conditions at baseline effectively eliminated the relationship. Analyses limited to participants with good to excellent health or no functional impairments at baseline showed no association between depressive symptoms and subsequent mortality risk. Secondary analyses showed no association between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: These findings from a randomly selected, nationally representative sample do not support the hypothesis that depressive symptoms are independently related to mortality in the general population, after adequate adjustment for the confounding effects of physical health status.

        "abstract": "Objective. To examine the relative and combined impact of depressive and chronic physical conditions on functional status and health-care use in the general population. Method. Canadian, representative, population-based cross-sectional survey (n=130880). Major depressive disorder (MDD) in the past 12 months was assessed by structured interview, and physical disorders, activity reduction, role impairment and work absence by self-report. The relative impact of MDD and six common chronic physical illnesses (asthma, arthritis, back problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes) was estimated using multivariate regression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and overall chronic physical illness burden. Results. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol dependence and chronic physical illness burden, the presence of co-morbid MDD was associated with significantly greater (approximately double the) likelihood of health-care utilization and increased functional disability and work absence compared to the presence of a chronic physical illness without co-morbid MDD. This impact of MDD was seen across each of the six chronic physical illnesses examined in this study, with the strongest associations seen for work absence. Conclusions. These observations confirm prior findings of a strong association at the population level between major depression and health-care use and role impairment among persons with chronic physical disorders. They also point to the significant impact of co-morbid major depression on health-care seeking, disability and work absence in persons with chronic physical illness, underscoring the need for greater efforts to design and test the impact of detection and treatment programs for such individuals.",

The main outcome measures were depressive symptoms as assessed by the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale short form (CES-D-10) questionnaire, presence or absence of metabolic syndrome, and CRF as measured by a maximal exercise treadmill test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen and men who exhibited depressive symptoms had a statistically higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared to those who did not (for women, 15.4% versus 7.2%, P < 0.0001; for men, 31.6% versus 22.8%, P < 0.0001). Individuals with depressive symptoms had an increased frequency of higher waist circumference, higher triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein. Women with depressive symptoms also had marginally higher fasting blood glucose levels. After adjusting for age and smoking status, the odds of metabolic syndrome in women with depressive symptoms was 2.81 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.01-3.93] times the odds of metabolic syndrome in those without depressive symptoms, and in men with depressive symptoms, the odds were 1.69 (95% CI, 1.42-2.00) times the odds of metabolic syndrome in men without.

        "abstract": "Study Design. Population-based, case-control and case-crossover study. Objective. To investigate associations between chiro- practic visits and vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke and to contrast this with primary care physician (PCP) visits and VBA stroke. Summary of Background Data. Chiropractic care is popular for neck pain and headache, but may increase the risk for VBA dissection and stroke. Neck pain and headache are common symptoms of VBA dissection, which commonly precedes VBA stroke. Methods. Cases included eligible incident VBA strokes admitted to Ontario hospitals from April 1, 1993 to March 31, 2002. Four controls were age and gender matched to each case. Case and control exposures to chiropractors and PCPs were determined from health billing records in the year before the stroke date. In the case-crossover analysis, cases acted as their own controls. Results. There were 818 VBA strokes hospitalized in a population of more than 100 million person-years. In those aged (cid:1) 45 years, cases were about three times more likely to see a chiropractor or a PCP before their stroke than controls. Results were similar in the case control and case crossover analyses. There was no increased association between chiropractic visits and VBA stroke in those older than 45 years. Positive associations were found between PCP visits and VBA stroke in all age groups. Practitioner visits billed for headache and neck complaints were highly associated with subsequent VBA stroke. Conclusion. VBA stroke is a very rare event in the population. The risks of VBA stroke associated with chiropractic and PCP visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection seeking care before their stroke. We found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care. was excluded from the PCP analysis, since patients might consult these physicians after experiencing a stroke. We tested different hazard periods, including 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month before the index date. Exposure occurred if any chiropractic or PCP visits were recorded during the des-ignated hazard periods. We also measured the effect of cumulative numbers of chiropractic and PCP visits in the month before the index date by computing the odds ratio for each incremental visit. These estimates were similarly strati\ufb01ed by age and by diagnostic codes related to headache and/or neck pain. Finally, we conducted analyses to determine if our results were sensitive to chiropractic and PCP visits related to neck complaints and headaches. We report our results as odds ratios (OR) and 95% con\ufb01dence intervals.

        "abstract": "Background This study assessed the risk of developing acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization in association with the use of certain antipsychotic medications in schizophrenia patients. Methods A nationwide cohort of 31,177 inpatients with schizophrenia between the ages of 18 and 65 years whose records were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan from 2000 to 2008 and were studied after encrypting the identifications. Cases (n = 147) were patients with subsequent acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization after their first psychiatric admission. Based on a nested case-control design, each case was matched with 20 controls for age, sex and the year of first psychiatric admission using risk-set sampling. The effects of antipsychotic agents on the development of acute coronary syndrome were assessed using multiple conditional logistic regression and sensitivity analyses to confirm any association. Results We found that current use of aripiprazole (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.27\u201310.64, p<0.05) and chlorpromazine (adjusted RR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.40\u20136.24, p<0.001) were associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of developing acute coronary syndrome. Although haloperidol was associated with an increased risk (adjusted RR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.20\u20133.44, p<0.01), there was no clear dose-dependent relationship. These three antipsychotic agents were also associated with an increased risk in the first 30 days of use, and the risk decreased as the duration of therapy increased. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score-adjusted modeling showed that the results were similar to those of multiple regression analysis. Conclusions Patients with schizophrenia who received aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol could have a potentially elevated risk of developing acute coronary syndrome, particularly at the start of therapy.",

        "abstract": "Depression is a very common and ancient mental disorder prevalent all over the world since centuries affecting all age groups of both male and female genders. It is the 4th most serious public health problem worldwide with about 350 million people being affected and expected to be the most common mental disorder by year 2020 [1]. Depression has a wide range of symptoms that include low mood, negative thoughts, pessimism, guilt, and ugliness, indecisiveness, lack of interest and motivation, decreased sexual desire, appetite and sleep [2]. Depressive patients end their lives through suicide as a Complication of the disease. Suicide rates vary from country to country with Hungary on top where the rate is 58/100, 000 followed by, USA 20/100000 and Spain9/100000 every year. Prevalence of depression has long been studied in different populations that were found as ranging from 5% in general population and 10%-20% in chronic sick patients [3]. It is 3%8.7% prevalent in children and 25% in pregnant women [4]. Students show a prevalence of 53.43% in Pakistan while 26.2% in Turkey [5]. Depression is also a risk factor for atherosclerosis in addition to smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and dyslipidemia [6]. The ideal treatment plan for depression consists of pharmacotherapy, psychological and educational interventions [7]. There are many pharmacological treatment options for depression like Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), Selective serotonin norepinephrine inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antidepressants [8]. SSRIs are most popular as they are safe, more tolerable, cheaper and due to their spectrum of indication other than depression [9]. It is also used to treat the premature ejaculation [10]. Escitalopram is derived from Citalopram with a bioavailability of 80% and halflife of 27-32 hours makes it once daily dosage of 10-20mg/day [9]. It is recommended to check total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides in patients which are at risk of atherosclerosis",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, studies have shown the prevalence of depression among people with diabetes. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the possible beneficial effects of escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on metabolic changes and cardiac complications in type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by feeding the rats high fat-high fructose diet (HFFD) for 8 weeks followed by a subdiabetogenic dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg, i. p.). Treatment with escitalopram (10 mg/kg/day; p. o.) was then initiated for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, electrocardiography was performed and blood samples were collected for determination of glycemic and lipid profiles. Animals were then euthanized and heart samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological examinations. Escitalopram alleviated the HFFD/STZ-induced metabolic and cardiac derangements as evident by improvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory, fibrogenic and apoptotic markers in addition to hypertrophy and impaired conduction. These results could be secondary to its beneficial effects on the glycemic control and hence the reduction of receptor for advanced glycation end products content as revealed in the present study. In conclusion, escitalopram could be considered a favorable antidepressant medication in diabetic patients as it seems to positively impact the glycemic control in diabetes in addition to prevention of its associated cardiovascular complications.",

In this study, T2DM mice were treated with different concentrations of TFs by gavage for 10 weeks to investigate the effect of TFs on diabetic nephropathy and their potential molecular mechanism of action. Biochemical and pathological analysis showed that the TFs effectively improved blood glucose, insulin resistance, kidney function, and other symptoms in diabetic mice. The mechanism studies indicated that TFs inhibited the formation of AGEs, thereby inhibiting the activation of the MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

However, its effect on diabetic liver and kidney injury and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, our findings indicated that TFDG administration effectively lowers the fasting blood glucose and serum lipid concentrations and enhances the functionality and cellular architecture of the liver and kidney in rats with diabetes. The data also showed that TFDG mitigates oxidative harm in the liver and kidney of rats afflicted with diabetes. Additionally, metformin combined with TFDG was significantly more effective in reducing blood glucose and oxidative stress. Further studies suggested that TFDG upregulates the Nrf2 signal pathway and circ-ITCH (hsa_circ_0001141) expression. Silencing of circ-ITCH by transfection of the interfering plasmid apparently reduces the effects of TFDG on the Nrf2 signal pathway and oxidative stress in high-glucose-treated hepatic and renal cells.
