        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) in the treatment of depression in 191 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study. A placebo washout period of 3-7 days was followed by an 8 week active treatment phase during which patients received either paroxetine (20-40 mg daily) or amitriptyline (75-150 mg daily). The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at endpoint.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParoxetine was as effective as amitriptyline for the treatment of depression, with similar improvements in RA associated pain and disability also seen in both groups. However, paroxetine was better tolerated than amitriptyline, with an overall frequency of adverse experiences of 56.4% and 67.7% in the 2 groups, respectively. The frequency of anticholinergic adverse experiences was much lower in the paroxetine treatment group (18.1% vs 43.8% taking amitriptyline) and paroxetine treated patients also experienced fewer severe (16.0% vs 21.9%), serious nonfatal (0% vs 4.2%), and drug related adverse experiences (12.8% vs 29.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTolerability is an important consideration in this patient population, which is largely composed of elderly patients who are taking additional medications for RA. Paroxetine shows a number of advantages in the management of depression comorbid with RA.",

        "abstract": "Objective. To examine the relative and combined impact of depressive and chronic physical conditions on functional status and health-care use in the general population. Method. Canadian, representative, population-based cross-sectional survey (n=130880). Major depressive disorder (MDD) in the past 12 months was assessed by structured interview, and physical disorders, activity reduction, role impairment and work absence by self-report. The relative impact of MDD and six common chronic physical illnesses (asthma, arthritis, back problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes) was estimated using multivariate regression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and overall chronic physical illness burden. Results. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol dependence and chronic physical illness burden, the presence of co-morbid MDD was associated with significantly greater (approximately double the) likelihood of health-care utilization and increased functional disability and work absence compared to the presence of a chronic physical illness without co-morbid MDD. This impact of MDD was seen across each of the six chronic physical illnesses examined in this study, with the strongest associations seen for work absence. Conclusions. These observations confirm prior findings of a strong association at the population level between major depression and health-care use and role impairment among persons with chronic physical disorders. They also point to the significant impact of co-morbid major depression on health-care seeking, disability and work absence in persons with chronic physical illness, underscoring the need for greater efforts to design and test the impact of detection and treatment programs for such individuals.",

The association among these factors in a generally healthy, active population with access to health care is not well defined.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected on 5,125 women and men during preventive care examinations at the Cooper Clinic from 2000 to 2008. The main outcome measures were depressive symptoms as assessed by the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale short form (CES-D-10) questionnaire, presence or absence of metabolic syndrome, and CRF as measured by a maximal exercise treadmill test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen and men who exhibited depressive symptoms had a statistically higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared to those who did not (for women, 15.4% versus 7.2%, P < 0.0001; for men, 31.6% versus 22.8%, P < 0.0001). Individuals with depressive symptoms had an increased frequency of higher waist circumference, higher triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein. Women with depressive symptoms also had marginally higher fasting blood glucose levels. After adjusting for age and smoking status, the odds of metabolic syndrome in women with depressive symptoms was 2.81 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.01-3.93] times the odds of metabolic syndrome in those without depressive symptoms, and in men with depressive symptoms, the odds were 1.69 (95% CI, 1.42-2.00) times the odds of metabolic syndrome in men without. When controlled for CRF level, the presence or absence of depressive symptoms on the presence of metabolic syndrome is attenuated but remains statistically significant in women.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEven in a generally healthy population with access to health care, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with increased metabolic syndrome.",

The authors compared the rates of antidepressant use during case and control time windows of 7, 14, and 28 days. Adjustments were made for time-dependent variables, such as health system utilization and proposed confounding medications. Stratified analyses were performed for valuing the interaction between the stroke risk of antidepressant use and age, sex, presence of mood disorder, stroke type, severity of chronic illness, and duration of antidepressant treatment. A conditional logistic regression model was used to determine the odds of antidepressant use during case time windows.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe adjusted odds ratio of stroke risk with antidepressant exposure was 1.48 (95% confidence interval=1.37-1.59) using 14-day time windows. Stroke risk was negatively associated with the number of antidepressant prescriptions reported. Use of antidepressants with high inhibition of the serotonin transporter was associated with a greater risk of stroke than use of other types of antidepressants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that antidepressant use may be associated with an increased risk of stroke.

        "abstract": "Background This study assessed the risk of developing acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization in association with the use of certain antipsychotic medications in schizophrenia patients. Methods A nationwide cohort of 31,177 inpatients with schizophrenia between the ages of 18 and 65 years whose records were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan from 2000 to 2008 and were studied after encrypting the identifications. Cases (n = 147) were patients with subsequent acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization after their first psychiatric admission. Based on a nested case-control design, each case was matched with 20 controls for age, sex and the year of first psychiatric admission using risk-set sampling. The effects of antipsychotic agents on the development of acute coronary syndrome were assessed using multiple conditional logistic regression and sensitivity analyses to confirm any association. Results We found that current use of aripiprazole (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.27\u201310.64, p<0.05) and chlorpromazine (adjusted RR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.40\u20136.24, p<0.001) were associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of developing acute coronary syndrome. Although haloperidol was associated with an increased risk (adjusted RR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.20\u20133.44, p<0.01), there was no clear dose-dependent relationship. These three antipsychotic agents were also associated with an increased risk in the first 30 days of use, and the risk decreased as the duration of therapy increased. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score-adjusted modeling showed that the results were similar to those of multiple regression analysis. Conclusions Patients with schizophrenia who received aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol could have a potentially elevated risk of developing acute coronary syndrome, particularly at the start of therapy.",

        "abstract": "Depression is a very common and ancient mental disorder prevalent all over the world since centuries affecting all age groups of both male and female genders. It is the 4th most serious public health problem worldwide with about 350 million people being affected and expected to be the most common mental disorder by year 2020 [1]. Depression has a wide range of symptoms that include low mood, negative thoughts, pessimism, guilt, and ugliness, indecisiveness, lack of interest and motivation, decreased sexual desire, appetite and sleep [2]. Depressive patients end their lives through suicide as a Complication of the disease. Suicide rates vary from country to country with Hungary on top where the rate is 58/100, 000 followed by, USA 20/100000 and Spain9/100000 every year. Prevalence of depression has long been studied in different populations that were found as ranging from 5% in general population and 10%-20% in chronic sick patients [3]. It is 3%8.7% prevalent in children and 25% in pregnant women [4]. Students show a prevalence of 53.43% in Pakistan while 26.2% in Turkey [5]. Depression is also a risk factor for atherosclerosis in addition to smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and dyslipidemia [6]. The ideal treatment plan for depression consists of pharmacotherapy, psychological and educational interventions [7]. There are many pharmacological treatment options for depression like Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), Selective serotonin norepinephrine inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antidepressants [8]. SSRIs are most popular as they are safe, more tolerable, cheaper and due to their spectrum of indication other than depression [9]. It is also used to treat the premature ejaculation [10]. Escitalopram is derived from Citalopram with a bioavailability of 80% and halflife of 27-32 hours makes it once daily dosage of 10-20mg/day [9]. It is recommended to check total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides in patients which are at risk of atherosclerosis",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, studies have shown the prevalence of depression among people with diabetes. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the possible beneficial effects of escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on metabolic changes and cardiac complications in type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by feeding the rats high fat-high fructose diet (HFFD) for 8 weeks followed by a subdiabetogenic dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg, i. p.). Treatment with escitalopram (10 mg/kg/day; p. o.) was then initiated for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, electrocardiography was performed and blood samples were collected for determination of glycemic and lipid profiles. Animals were then euthanized and heart samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological examinations. Escitalopram alleviated the HFFD/STZ-induced metabolic and cardiac derangements as evident by improvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory, fibrogenic and apoptotic markers in addition to hypertrophy and impaired conduction. These results could be secondary to its beneficial effects on the glycemic control and hence the reduction of receptor for advanced glycation end products content as revealed in the present study. In conclusion, escitalopram could be considered a favorable antidepressant medication in diabetic patients as it seems to positively impact the glycemic control in diabetes in addition to prevention of its associated cardiovascular complications.",

        "abstract": "Most peripheral serotonin (5-HT) is synthesized in enterochromaffin cells, and most circulating 5-HT is stored in platelets. As a monoamine, 5-HT has several functions in various non-neuronal and neuronal systems. In the central nervous system, it functions as a neurotransmitter to modulate feeding behavior and mood. Numerous clinical trials have focused on increasing 5-HT activation in the central nervous system, including those involving anti-obesity drugs currently in the market, although severe side effects on peripheral system can lead to the withdrawal of certain drugs. Recent studies have revealed that both the peripheral and central serotonergic systems play a vital role in diabetes and its complications. This review summarizes the roles of the serotonergic system in blood glucose regulation, diabetic macroangiopathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and diabetic encephalopathy, indicating its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and its complications.",

        "abstract": "Theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TFDG) in black tea has a strong antioxidant capacity. However, its effect on diabetic liver and kidney injury and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, our findings indicated that TFDG administration effectively lowers the fasting blood glucose and serum lipid concentrations and enhances the functionality and cellular architecture of the liver and kidney in rats with diabetes. The data also showed that TFDG mitigates oxidative harm in the liver and kidney of rats afflicted with diabetes. Additionally, metformin combined with TFDG was significantly more effective in reducing blood glucose and oxidative stress. Further studies suggested that TFDG upregulates the Nrf2 signal pathway and circ-ITCH (hsa_circ_0001141) expression. Silencing of circ-ITCH by transfection of the interfering plasmid apparently reduces the effects of TFDG on the Nrf2 signal pathway and oxidative stress in high-glucose-treated hepatic and renal cells. In conclusion, the present study highlights the great potential of TFDG in ameliorating diabetic liver and kidney injury by up-regulating circ-ITCH to promote the Nrf2 signal pathway and provides a potential option for the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.",
