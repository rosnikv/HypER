        "abstract": "To test whether azathioprine in effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses smaller than those normally used the drug was tested at 2 dosage levels, 2.5 and 1.25 mg/kg/day (2.5 AZ and 1.25 AZ), against placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. Dropouts were 7 out of 15 in the 2.5 AZ group, 4 out of 14 in the 1.25 AZ group, and 2 out of 13 in the placebo group. Some significant improvement occurred in all 3 groups, including those on placebo. However, the 2.5 AZ group fared significantly better than the placebo group, while the 1.25 AZ group results tended to fall between the other 2 groups. We conclude that, in order to obtain the reported effectiveness of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis, it is necessary to start treatment with 2.5 mg/kg/day. Halving this dosage reduces the effectiveness of the drug.",

A reduction in the dose was permitted for adverse side effects. After 6 months of therapy, patients who showed clinically relevant improvement, defined as a 40% or greater reduction in their total joint activity score, were given the option to continue receiving the therapy for an additional 6 months.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAt 6 months, clinically relevant improvement occurred in 10 of 15 patients (95% CI, 38 to 88) receiving high-dose therapy and in 4 of 16 patients (CI, 7 to 52) receiving low-dose therapy (P = 0.02). Statistically significant improvements in individual measures were shown only in the high-dose group. Improvements were noted in the number of tender joints (-18.8; CI, -24.5 to -13.1) and swollen joints (-12.1; CI, -15.4 to -8.6), as well as in physician's global scores (-1.5; CI, -2.1 to -0.9) and patient's global scores (-1.1; CI, -1.9 to -0.5). Improvement in disease activity was maintained through 12 months in the high-dose group. The clinical responses to cyclosporin A were most evident in patients with depressed in-vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes to soluble recall antigens. Toxicities, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal and neurologic complaints, and hypertrichosis were frequent but often reversible with a reduction in the dose. Nephrotoxicity, with a 20% increase in the serum creatinine level, was seen in 27 of 31 patients (CI, 71 to 97).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCyclosporin A is an effective therapy for severe, treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients whose pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were hypoproliferative in vitro to soluble recall antigens responded better clinically to CsA treatment than did the other patients. During therapy, proliferative responses became normal and remained so until 1-2 months after CsA was discontinued. At that time, the lymphocyte proliferation defect reappeared. In addition, patients who responded clinically to CsA had a higher percentage of Leu-7+ natural killer cells in their peripheral blood prior to therapy. All patients exhibited greater frequencies of cells that expressed interleukin-2 receptors, which decreased with CsA treatment. The clinical response to CsA appears to be associated with distinct immunologic parameters in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Although autoreactive T cells are thought to play a prominent role in autoimmune disease in MRL-lpr/lpr mice, it has been difficult to directly determine if autoreactive T cells escape from the thymus and react with self-antigens in the periphery. Defective expression of the Fas apoptosis antigen in MRL-lpr/lpr mice results from the insertion of the ETn retrotransposon. The fas defect can be partially corrected in CD2-fas transgenic mice in which the expression of fas is corrected in T cells. To identify a possible defect in clonal deletion or clonal anergy induction of auto-specific T cells, we have studied C57BL/6-lpr/lpr transgenic mice that express TcR genes that recognize a known self-antigen, the male H-Y antigen. In addition, we have analyzed clonal deletion and tolerance induction after neonatal tolerance induction and superantigen-induced arthritis with the class II MHC reactive superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in V beta 8 TcR transgenic and non-transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Neonatal tolerance induction to SEB was normal in lpr/lpr mice. However, over time a loss of tolerance (thymic or peripheral) was observed in lpr/lpr mice but not in +/+ TcR transgenic mice. This defect in lpr/lpr mice was thymic-dependent and was due to increased CD28/CTLA4 signaling. These results suggest that an apoptosis defect involving both thymocytes and peripheral lymphoid cells leads to autoimmune disease in lpr/lpr mice. The challenge in the future will be to determine the role of defective apoptosis in other autoimmune diseases.",

        "title": "Superantigens in Autoimmune Diseases: Still More Shades of Gray",
        "abstract": "Superantigens (SAgs) have the capacity of stimulating T cells polyclonally. The only requirement for T cells to respond is the expression of particular T-cell receptor (TCR) VP elements (Fleischer & Schrezemeier 1988, MacDonald et al. 1988, White et al. 1989). Any SAg can, therefore, stimulate between 1% and 40% ofthe total T-cell repertoire, with a wide range of peptide specificities. SAgs have the capacity of binding tightly to MHC class II molecules and are, because of the restricted distribution of these molecules, presented mostly by classical antigenpresenting cells (Held et al. 1994, MacDonald et al. 1993). They are produced by bacteria {Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia and Mycoplasma) as exotoxins, by viruses (rabies and cytomegalovirus) as components of the viral particle and by retroviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV) where they are produced after integration of the reverse transcribed genome into the host DNA (AchaOrbea & MacDonald, 1995). Autoreactivity in the absence of autoimmunity is more the rule than the exception. Autoreactive T and B cells can be easily isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals (He et al. 1993, Hohlfeld et al. 1984, Wucherpfennig et al. 1991). In experimental animals, autoimmunity can be induced by injection of autoantigens or can occur spontaneously in certain strains (see below). The discovery of SAgs immediately raised attractive models for the induction of autoimmunity, since the polyclonal activation of T and B cells by SAgs does not distinguish between autoimmune and normal lymphocytes. This activation might break the delicate balance of tolerance. After SAg encounter, a polyclonal activation of T cells occurs, which is usually",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on human cells. Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

        "title": "Class II Transactivator: Mastering the Art of Major Histocompatibility Complex Expression",
        "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are the predominant presenters of exogenous antigens to T helper cells (reviewed in references 21, 77, and 99). These key molecules are critical for numerous aspects of immune function, including T-cell selection, tolerance induction, antibody production, T-cell-mediated immunity, and the inflammatory response. As principal mediators of transplant rejection, these molecules are often common targets for immune therapies to prevent the rejection of grafted tissues. Class II MHC is implicated as a contributing factor in a host of diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes to Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. \n \nConstitutive expression of class II MHC is restricted to \u201cprofessional\u201d antigen-presenting cells but can be induced on various tissues by gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3). In humans, a congenital lack of both constitutive and inducible class II results in a profound and generally fatal immunodeficiency (type II bare lymphocyte syndrome [BLS]) (7, 29, 45, 61, 67, 75, 112) marked by a significant reduction of CD4+ T cells. Early molecular forays addressing BLS revealed that the genes encoding class II MHC were not defective. Instead, the defect lay in transcription factors controlling class II MHC gene expression. BLS thus became the first disease known to be caused by defective or absent transcription factors. The availability of patient-derived cell lines with class II MHC transcription defects provided a unique tool of nature to identify the requisite transcription factors. \n \nTranscriptional regulation of class II MHC expression is complex. Class II MHC and related promoters are characterized by the presence of conserved W (or S), X, and Y boxes (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1)1) (reviewed in references 10, 67, and 75). The X element is bipartite. The upstream X1 region is recognized by RFX, a trimeric complex of RFX family members including RFX5, RFXANK (RFX-B), and RFXAP (32, 74, 87, 117). The downstream X2 box is bound by X2BP (NF-X2), a complex comprising CREB, and an unidentified 120-kDa protein (83, 84). Another trimeric complex, NF-Y (CBF), which is highly conserved in eukaryotes, binds the Y box (69, 71, 146; reviewed in reference 70). A number of factors interacting with the W box have been described, including the RFX complex (26, 48, 120). The factors involved in X and Y box binding are ubiquitous and expressed constitutively yet fail to account for either constitutive or IFN-\u03b3-inducible class II MHC expression. Somatic cell fusions using BLS patient-derived cells allowed the definition of complementation groups, with each group containing a defect in a single genetic locus. This type of analysis revealed a crucial locus, aIr-1, which in all likelihood encodes the class II transactivator (CIITA), which explained the lack of class II transcription in BLS complementation group A (1, 118). Group A cells express the requisite X and Y binding proteins but fail to transcribe class II. CIITA expression appears to be a nearly absolute requisite for expression of class II MHC, whether constitutive or inducible (17, 19, 23, 47, 85, 103, 114, 118, 119). A number of class II MHC-related genes including genes encoding HLA-DM (H-2M in mice) and invariant chain (Ii), with promoters similar to those for classical class II genes, are also regulated by CIITA (17, 18, 22, 23, 50, 137). CIITA can also upregulate expression of class I MHC genes and beta-2-microglobulin (\u03b22m) through effects at site \u03b1 in addition to X- and Y-like sequences in the promoters for these genes (40, 72, 104). These initial observations have led to the view that CIITA is a master, or global, regulator for expression of class II MHC and related genes. \n \n \n \nFIG. 1 \n \nOrganization of W, X, Y, and other motifs in the promoters of class II MHC and related genes. Genes coding for class II MHC and related proteins contain well conserved W, X, and Y boxes, the presence of which correlates with transcriptional regulation ... \n \n \n \nSince the discovery of CIITA, numerous primary articles and several reviews on its role in regulating the class II MHC have been published. In this review, we will discuss the molecular structure of this novel protein, its mechanism of function, and its biologic and clinical relevance, which is broad.",

        "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

Pretreatment with specific inhibitors showed that induction of KAI1 by PMA uses classic isoforms of protein kinase C (cPKC), is independent of Ras and Raf, and requires activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but does not involve p38MAPK. Induction of KAI1 transcription by PMA was associated with enhanced overall acetylation of histones H3 and H4, but only acetylation of H3 was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that PMA induces recruitment of Tip60/Pontin activator complexes to NFkappaB-p50 motifs in the proximal promoter, and this was blocked by a PKC inhibitor. These changes were not associated with differences in overall levels of Tip60, Pontin, beta-catenin, or Reptin protein expression but with PMA-induced nuclear translocation of Tip60.",

        "abstract": "In recognition of World TB day (March 24), tuberculosis (TB) experts from New York State and vicinity met to discuss scientific progress and how it can impact control of TB. The meeting was held in Saranac Lake where Dr. E. L. Trudeau first cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) following the guidelines of Dr. Koch and also where Trudeau set up his successful TB sanitarium (Fig. 1). Many attendees were excited to visit this historical center of TB research and treatment however, they left with a profound sense of how much there remains to be done in order to bring TB under control. The majority of the meeting was in a workshop format with speakers providing a 15-min presentation of their recent work in three scientific sessions. The first session was entitled \u2018\u2018Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a potent pathogen\u2019\u2019, the second was \u2018\u2018Tuberculosis: the nature of the human disease\u2019\u2019 and the third was \u2018\u2018Cellular Immunity to tuberculosis: from animal models to human disease\u2019\u2019. At the end of these scientific sessions, a final open discussion session was held entitled \u2018\u2018Vaccination, Drugs and Public Health: the trifecta of tuberculosis control worldwide\u2019\u2019. This consisted of a focused discussion of what is required to improve vaccination, drug development and public health. The meeting was opened with a poem written by a student in 1908 in honor of Dr. E. L. Trudeau\u2019s 60th birthday. Dr. Trudeau started the Trudeau sanitarium and research facilities in Saranac Lake 125 years ago and his legacy lives on in the Trudeau Institute where the meeting was held. Mtb: a potent pathogen In the first session, the speakers stressed the importance of understanding the basic biology of mycobacteria in order to identify new drug targets and facilitate rational drug design. Using a variety of genetic tools, the speakers highlighted how mycobacteria communicate with Figure 1. The images show: Dr. E. L.

        "abstract": "Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node and requires transport of M. tuberculosis by migratory dendritic cells (DCs) to the local lymph node. The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Effector T cells control intracellular infection by secreting cytokines and through contact-dependent cytolysis. Because cytokines can diffuse and act at a distance, we determined whether cytokine diffusion is sufficient to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis or whether direct recognition of infected cells by CD4 T cells is required. Using MHC class II (MHC II) mixed bone marrow chimeras, we compared the bacterial burdens in lung myeloid cells that were capable (MHC II+/+) or not (MHC II\u2212/\u2212) of being recognized by CD4 T cells. MHC II+/+ cells had lower bacterial burdens than did MHC II\u2212/\u2212 cells. CD4 T cell depletion increased the number of bacteria associated with MHC II+/+cells but not MHC II\u2212/\u2212 cells, indicating that direct recognition of infected cells by CD4 T cells is required for control of intracellular M. tuberculosis. These results show that the effector mechanisms required for CD4 T cell control of distinct intracellular pathogens differ and that long-range cytokine diffusion does not contribute to control of M. tuberculosis.",

        "title": "Rapid Sequestration of Leishmania mexicana by Neutrophils Contributes to the Development of Chronic Lesion",
        "abstract": "The protozoan Leishmania mexicana parasite causes chronic non-healing cutaneous lesions in humans and mice with poor parasite control. The mechanisms preventing the development of a protective immune response against this parasite are unclear. Here we provide data demonstrating that parasite sequestration by neutrophils is responsible for disease progression in mice. Within hours of infection L. mexicana induced the local recruitment of neutrophils, which ingested parasites and formed extracellular traps without markedly impairing parasite survival. We further showed that the L. mexicana-induced recruitment of neutrophils impaired the early recruitment of dendritic cells at the site of infection as observed by intravital 2-photon microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Indeed, infection of neutropenic Genista mice and of mice depleted of neutrophils at the onset of infection demonstrated a prominent role for neutrophils in this process. Furthermore, an increase in monocyte-derived dendritic cells was also observed in draining lymph nodes of neutropenic mice, correlating with subsequent increased frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting T helper cells, and better parasite control leading ultimately to complete healing of the lesion. Altogether, these findings show that L. mexicana exploits neutrophils to block the induction of a protective immune response and impairs the control of lesion development. Our data thus demonstrate an unanticipated negative role for these innate immune cells in host defense, suggesting that in certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis, regulating neutrophil recruitment could be a strategy to promote lesion healing.",

        "abstract": "Infection of C57BL/6 mice with most Leishmania major strains results in a healing lesion and clearance of parasites from the skin. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain (LmSd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, LmSd elicited early upregulation of IL\u20101\u03b2 mRNA and IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin. Mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, or caspase\u20101/11, or lacking IL\u20101\u03b2 or IL\u20101 receptor signaling, developed healing lesions and cleared LmSd from the infection site. Mice resistant to LmSd had a stronger antigen\u2010specific Th1 response. The possibility that IL\u20101\u03b2 might act through neutrophil recruitment to locally suppress immunity was supported by the healing observed in neutropenic Genista mice. Secretion of mature IL\u20101\u03b2 by LmSd\u2010infected macrophages in vitro was dependent on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome and caspase\u20101. These data reveal that Nlrp3 inflammasome\u2010dependent IL\u20101\u03b2, associated with localized neutrophil recruitment, plays a crucial role in the development of a nonhealing form of cutaneous leishmaniasis in conventionally resistant mice.",

        "abstract": "IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interaction with eosinophils maintains dermis-resident macrophages as replicative niches for Leishmania major. Tight tissue associations The intracellular pathogen Leishmania major has been found to replicate in dermal tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) that have an M2-like phenotype, but L. major also promotes a strong TH1 immune environment. Here, Lee et al. show that dermal TRMs can maintain an M2 phenotype in this TH1 environment through IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interactions with eosinophils. Eosinophils were identified as the main source of IL-4 that drove local proliferation of dermal TRMs with M2 properties. IL-4 and IL-10 stimulation of dermal TRMs triggered production of CCL24, which promoted further eosinophil recruitment and close interactions with TRMs. These observations provide insight into this intercellular interaction that may have relevance to other inflammatory conditions. Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) maintain tissue homeostasis, but they can also provide a replicative niche for intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. How dermal TRMs proliferate and maintain their M2 properties even in the strong TH1 environment of the L. major infected dermis is not clear. Here, we show that, in infected mice lacking IL-4/13 from eosinophils, dermal TRMs shifted to a proinflammatory state, their numbers declined, and disease was attenuated. Intravital microscopy revealed a rapid infiltration of eosinophils followed by their tight interaction with dermal TRMs. IL-4\u2013stimulated dermal TRMs, in concert with IL-10, produced a large amount of CCL24, which functioned to amplify eosinophil influx and their interaction with dermal TRMs. An intraperitoneal helminth infection model also demonstrated a requirement for eosinophil-derived IL-4 to maintain tissue macrophages through a CCL24-mediated amplification loop. CCL24 secretion was confined to resident macrophages in other tissues, implicating eosinophil-TRM cooperative interactions in diverse inflammatory settings.",

However, macrophages demonstrate a remarkable degree of tissue\u2010specific functionality and have diverse origins that vary by tissue site and inflammation status. With our understanding of this diversity has come an appreciation of the longevity and replicative capacity of tissue\u2010resident macrophages and thus the realisation that macrophages may persist through tissue perturbations and inflammatory events with important consequences for cell function. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the parameters that regulate macrophage survival and function, focusing on the relative importance of the tissue environment versus cell\u2010intrinsic factors, such as origin, how long a cell has been resident within a tissue and prior history of activation. Thus, we reconsider the view of macrophages as wholly plastic cells and raise many unanswered questions about the relative importance of cell life\u2010history versus environment in macrophage programming and function.",

        "abstract": "Rationale The role of circulating fetal monocytes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not known. We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia. Methods Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen\u2009\u00d7\u200914 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n\u2009=\u20092 term, n\u2009=\u20093 moderate/late preterm, and n\u2009=\u20095 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n\u2009=\u20094 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay. Results Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 vs. 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vessels per lung field; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14. Conclusions Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.",
