        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNo therapy has been shown to reliably prevent the evolution of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review This review will highlight the knowledge gained from studies published in the year 2005 on maintenance treatment after surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases. Recent findings In Crohn's disease the role of smoking in increasing the risk of relapse and recurrence after surgery is confirmed. Ornidazole seems effective in reducing endoscopic recurrence and clinical relapse after surgery. Probiotics do not appear to be effective in preventing endoscopic recurrence and clinical relapse: a controlled placebo trial showed that Lactobacillus johnsonii is not effective in preventing endoscopic recurrence. A retrospective study suggested that enteral nutrition after surgery may reduce the clinical relapse. Pathophysiological studies underlined the value of probiotics in pouchitis. Summary In Crohn's disease postoperative maintenance treatment is disappointing. Giving up smoking is still the only effective measure. Mesalamine remains the drug that has been widely studied with large trials and meta-analysis. Encouraging results come from small trials on antibiotics. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine must be evaluated in better designed controlled trials. There is no evidence in favour of probiotics as an effective therapy to prevent recurrence. Enteral nutrition after surgery is a candidate new therapy, but further controlled trials are needed. Pathophysiological studies confirm the beneficial role of probiotics in pouchitis.",

        "abstract": "Background: The best available tool to assess recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) is ileocolonoscopy (CC). Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) are noninvasive techniques able to detect small bowel lesions. In a prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the usefulness of SICUS and WCE for assessing postoperative recurrence of CD 1 year after surgery, using CC as the gold standard. Methods: Twenty\u2010two patients (11 men, median age 33 years, range 22\u201367 years) undergoing ileocolonic resection for CD were prospectively followed from July 2003 to May 2006, with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) used for clinical assessment every 3 months for 1 year. At 1 year, recurrence was assessed by SICUS and CC, followed by WCE. CD recurrence was assessed by CC (Rutgeerts score). SICUS was performed after ingestion of polyethylene glycol, and WCE was performed with Given M2A equipment. Results: At 1 year, all 22 patients had inactive CD (CDAI < 150). In 5 patients, WCE was not performed because of luminal narrowing or stenosis. Seventeen of the 22 patients had all 3 techniques performed. CC detected recurrence in 21 of 22 patients. Lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 22 patients (1 false positive). When considering only the 17 patients studied by all 3 techniques, recurrence was detected by CC in 16 of 17 patients, whereas lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 17 patients (16 true positives [TPs], 1 FP) and by WCE in 16 of 17 patients (16 TPs, 1 true negative). Conclusions: The present findings suggest that SICUS and WCE may be used as noninvasive techniques for the assessment of recurrence of CD in patients being regularly followed up after ileocolonic resection.

        "abstract": "Diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging data. Imaging of the morphological characteristics of IBD includes the assessment of mucosal alterations, transmural involvement and extraintestinal manifestations. No single imaging technique serves as a diagnostic gold standard to encompass all disease manifestations. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow cross-sectional imaging of the transmural alterations and extraintestinal manifestations. While in the USA the technique of choice is CT, in Europe the focus is more on MRI and ultrasound (US). Most patients with chronic IBD are diagnosed at a young age. After baseline diagnosis many of these young patients have to undergo repetitive imaging procedures during the variable clinical course of the disease, characterized by alternate periods of remission and active disease, and in monitoring the response to treatment. US has the advantage of being noninvasive, less costly, and easily repeatable, and thus can be very useful in following up patients with IBD. In addition, rising concern about radiation exposure in young adults indicates the demand for radiation-sparing techniques like US and MRI. This article focuses on the current clinical practice of US in IBD, describing the current technologies used in transabdominal intestinal US and the characteristic sonographic findings in Crohn\u00b4s disease and ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Imaging the gut provides information on Crohn's disease activity, identifies complications and provides insight into patient symptoms. Imaging can help direct therapy and can predict important patient outcomes. In a rapidly changing, technology-driven field, new imaging applications add novel insights that we are only beginning to appreciate. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in imaging as they are applied to the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. Recent findings In the past year, key literature describing cross-sectional imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) based imaging, specifically CT enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), transcutaneous ultrasound, and PET-based imaging, has emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease. MRI sequences that have been recently applied to Crohn's disease assessment, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), add important new insights. These new data highlight the current status of available imaging modalities and provide a glimpse into the future of our practice. Summary CTE and MRE are our new standard imaging modalities for small bowel Crohn's disease. PET scanning is promising but currently only used routinely in centers with a strong research presence in this area. Ultrasound is emerging as a useful, potentially less costly, radiation-free technique. New MRI sequences offer future promise for effectively monitoring the natural history of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by a relapsing-remitting clinical behavior and dominated by intestinal inflammation. Being a chronic disorder that with time develops into a disabling disease, it is important to monitor the severity of inflammation to assess the efficacy of medication, rule out complications, and prevent progression. This is particularly true now that the goals of treatment are mucosal healing and deep remission. Endoscopy has always been the gold standard for assessing mucosal activity in CD, but its use is limited by its invasiveness and its inability to examine the small intestine, proximal to the terminal ileum. Enteroscopy and the less invasive small bowel capsule endoscopy enable the small bowel to be thoroughly explored and scores are emerging for classifying small bowel disease activity. Cross-sectional imaging techniques (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography) are emerging as valid tools for monitoring CD patients, assessing inflammatory activity in the mucosa and the transmucosal extent of the disease, and for excluding extra-intestinal complications. Neither endoscopy nor imaging are suitable for assessing patients frequently, however. Noninvasive markers such as C-reactive protein, and fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin, are therefore useful to confirm the inflammatory burden of the disease and to identify patients requiring further investigations.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims\nIncreased small intestinal wall thickness correlates with both inflammatory activity and fibrosis in Crohn's disease [CD]. Assessment of perfusion holds promise as an objective marker distinguishing between the two conditions. Our primary aim was to determine if relative bowel wall perfusion measurements correlate with histopathological scores for inflammation or fibrosis in CD.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 25 patients were investigated before elective surgery for small intestinal CD. Unenhanced ultrasonography [US] and magnetic resonance enterography [MRE] were applied to describe bowel wall thickness. Perfusion was assessed with contrast-enhanced US [CEUS] and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRE [DCE-MRE]. Histopathology was used as gold standard.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with histopathology, the mean wall thickness was 0.4 mm greater on US [range -0.3 to 1.0, p = 0.24] and 1.4 mm greater on MR [0.4 to 2.3, p = 0.006]. No correlation was found between the severity of inflammation or fibrosis on histopathology, and either DCE-MRE [r = -0.13, p = 0.54 for inflammation and r = 0.41, p = 0.05 for fibrosis] or CEUS [r = 0.16, p = 0.45 for inflammation and r = -0.28, p = 0.19 for fibrosis]. Wall thickness assessed with US was correlated with both histological inflammation [r = 0.611, p = 0.0012] and fibrosis [r = 0.399, p = 0.048]. The same was not true for MR [r = 0.41, p = 0.047 for inflammation and r = 0.29, p = 0.16 for fibrosis].\n\n\nConclusions\nBowel wall thickness assessed with US is a valid marker of inflammation in small intestinal CD.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of the study was to investigate if texture analysis of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) images can determine Crohn disease (CD) stricture histologic type.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA radiology report database query identified 25 pediatric patients with established CD who underwent MRE followed by bowel resection within 30 days. MRE images were reviewed to identify strictures on enteric phase T1-weighted fat-suppressed images, that were matched with sites of histologic sectioning. Regions of interest were drawn over the bowel wall and texture analysis was performed using TexRAD software (Cambridge, UK), with skewness, mean, entropy and standard deviation parameters assessed. A pathologist reviewed all stricture histology specimens to assess for active mucosal inflammation and mural fibrosis. Multivariate logistic regression and analysis of variance were performed to identify texture features associated with stricture fibrosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-four bowel segments from 25 patients (mean age 16\u200a\u00b1\u200a2 years) with imaging-histologic correlation were included. Of note, all strictures included had undergone surgical resection with MRE imaging available within 30 days. The histologic distribution of these bowel segments included 9 segments that showed active inflammation without fibrosis, 23 segments that showed only fibrosis, and 32 mixed segments with concomitant active inflammation and fibrosis. Bivariate regression analysis demonstrated that skewness, standard deviation, entropy, and mean texture analysis features are independently associated with stricture fibrosis. Stepwise logistic regression showed that the combination of mean, skewness, and entropy texture predicted stricture fibrosis with a goodness-of-fit value of 0.995. A combination of threshold values for these 3 texture analysis parameters was able to correctly classify 100% of the strictures in the study cohort for presence (55/55) and absence (9/9) of fibrosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMRE texture analysis (MRE-TA) texture features can differentiate CD stricture types and accurately detect fibrosis.",
