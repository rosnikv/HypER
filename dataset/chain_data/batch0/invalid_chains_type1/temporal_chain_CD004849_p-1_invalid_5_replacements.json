        "title": "EVALUATING THE SAFETY AND POTENTIAL USE OF A WEIGHT-BEARING EXERCISE, TAI-CHI CHUAN, FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS",
        "abstract": "The safety of a traditional Chinese exercise, Tai-Chi Chuan, on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was evaluated. RA patients, who received 1 h of Tai-Chi Chuan instruction once (n = 20) and twice (n = 15) a week for 10 consecutive wk in two separate studies, showed no deterioration in their clinical disease activities compared with the corresponding controls (n = 11 and 9, respectively). Testing parameters included joint tenderness, joint swelling, time to walk 50 feet, handgrip strength and a written functional assessment. No significant exacerbation of joint symptoms using this weight-bearing form of exercise was observed. Tai-Chi Chuan exercise appears to be safe for RA patients and may serve as an alternative for their exercise therapy and part of their rehabilitation program. Weight-bearing exercises have the potential advantages of stimulating bone growth and strengthening connective tissue, but this effect needs to be documented in long-term studies.",

        "abstract": "Older persons who are willing to begin exercise programs are often not willing to continue them. At the Atlanta FICSIT (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques) site, individuals aged 70+ were randomized to Tai Chi (TC), individualized balance training (BT), and exercise control education (ED) groups for 15 weeks. In a follow-up assessment 4 months post-intervention, 130 subjects responded to exit interview questions asking about perceived benefits of participation. Both TC and BT subjects reported increased confidence in balance and movement, but only TC subjects reported that their daily activities and their overall life had been affected; many of these subjects had changed their normal physical activity to incorporate ongoing TC practice. The data suggest that when mental as well as physical control is perceived to be enhanced, with a generalized sense of improvement in overall well-being, older persons' motivation to continue exercising also increases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine: (a) the effect of two physical activity modes on changes in subjective well-being (SWB) over the course of a 12-month period in older, formerly sedentary adults (N = 174, M age = 65.5 years) and (b) the role played by physical activity participation and social support in changes in SWB over time.\n\n\nMETHOD\nParticipants were randomized into either an aerobic activity group or a stretching and toning group. Structural equation modeling was employed to conduct multiple sample latent growth curve analyses of individual growth in measures of SWB (happiness, satisfaction with life, and loneliness) over time.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA curvilinear growth pattern was revealed with well-being significantly improving over the course of the intervention followed by significant declines at the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent structural analyses were conducted showing that frequency of exercise participation was a significant predictor of improvement in satisfaction with life, whereas social relations were related to increases in satisfaction with life and reductions in loneliness. Improvements in social relations and exercise frequency also helped to buffer the declines in satisfaction with life at follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt appears that social relations integral to the exercise environment are significant determinants of subjective well-being in older adults. Findings are discussed in terms of how physical activity environments might be structured to maximize improvements in more global well-being constructs such as satisfaction with life.",

Our primary contribution is the creation of a virtual reality system that tracks the full body in a working volume of 4 meters by 5 meters by 2.3 meters high to produce an animated representation of the user with 42 degrees of freedom. This - combined with a lightweight (<3 pounds) belt-worn video receiver and head-mounted display - provides a wide area, untethered virtual environment that allows exploration of new application areas. Our secondary contribution is our attempt to show that user interface techniques made possible by such a system can improve training for a full body motor task. We tested several immersive techniques, such as providing multiple copies of a teacher's body positioned around the student and allowing the student to superimpose his body directly over the virtual teacher None of these techniques proved significantly better than mimicking traditional Tai Chi instruction, where we provided one virtual teacher directly in front of the student. We consider the implications of these findings for future motion training tasks.",

        "abstract": "Objective Several studies have reported that vegetarian diets are associated with a higher prevalence of major depression. Therefore, we hypothesised that the consumption of animal products, especially eggs, may have positive effects on mental health, especially on major depression, because a previous study reported that egg consumption produces numerous beneficial effects in humans. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic whole-egg treatment on depression-like behaviours in Wistar rats, a control strain, and Wistar Kyoto rats, an animal model of depression. Methods In both the rats, either whole-egg solution (5 ml/kg) or distilled water (5 ml/kg) was orally administrated for 35 days. During these periods, the open-field test (OFT) was conducted on the 21st day, and a forced swimming test (FST) was enforced on the 27th and 28th days. On the 36th day, the plasma and brain were collected. Results Chronic whole-egg treatment did not affect line crossing in the OFT, whereas it reduced the total duration of immobility in the FST on both strains. Furthermore, interestingly, the results indicated the possibility that whole-egg treatment elevated the incorporation of tryptophan into the brain, and the tryptophan concentration in the prefrontal cortex was actually increased by the treatment. Conclusion This study demonstrated that whole-egg treatment exerts an antidepressant-like effect in the FST. It is suggested that whole egg may be an excellent food for preventing and alleviating the conditions of major depression.",

A previous study confirmed a dysfunction of amino acid metabolism in the brain of WKY rats compared with that of WIS rats. At the neonatal stage, free amino acids in milk are important nutrients because they act as immediate nutrients for offspring and may affect later health and behavior of the offspring. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate free amino acid concentrations in milk and the relationships between free amino acid concentrations in milk and plasma in WIS and WKY rats. The concentrations of ten of the determined free amino acids in milk were significantly higher, but only L-methionine was significantly lower, in WKY rats. Six free amino acids had significantly higher concentrations in colostrum and two free amino acids had higher concentrations in matured milk. Free amino acid concentrations in plasma changed by both genetic background and lactation stage; however, the patterns of change in most free amino acid concentrations except for taurine in plasma were similar between WIS and WKY rats. The transport ratio of free amino acids from plasma to milk was not similar among the free amino acids tested, and each free amino acid was influenced by the genetic background and/or the type of milk.",

        "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of depression, heredity is believed to be a major factor. However, the mechanism by which heredity contributes to the onset of depression is not fully understood. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats have been used as an animal model for depression because of their increased depression-like behavior compared to Wistar (WIS) rats. In the present study, pups crossbred from WKY \u00d7 WIS rats were used to evaluate locomotor activity in an open field test (OFT) and depression-like behavior in a forced swimming test (FST), with a focus on amino acid metabolism. Pups in the WKY\u2642 \u00d7 WKY\u2640 group showed lower locomotor activity in the OFT and higher depression-like behavior in the FST than those in the WIS\u2642 \u00d7 WIS\u2640 group. In addition, multiple regression analysis showed that the paternal strain had a greater effect than the maternal strain on locomotor activity and depression-like behavior in OFT and FST, respectively. Several amino acids in the brainstem, hippocampus, and striatum were significantly decreased through the influence of the WKY paternal strain, but not the WKY maternal strain. Based on these data from comparing WKY and WIS rats, we hypothesize that the hereditary effects of the WKY paternal strain on behavioral tests are partially caused by dysregulation of the amino acid metabolism in the brain.",
