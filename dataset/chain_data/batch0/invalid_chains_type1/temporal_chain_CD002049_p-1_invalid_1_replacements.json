        "abstract": "Low energy laser (LEL) is a widely used treatment for a variety of musculoskeletal disorders although convincing documentation of the effect is missing. We have examined the LEL effect on Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in a double blind placebo controlled study. Twenty-two patients completed the study (10 receiving LEL treatment) according to the protocol. A significant effect on pain score was found due to LEL treatment, but when data were corrected for disease variation the effect disappeared. No effect of LEL could be demonstrated on the other assessed variables: grip strength, morning stiffness, flexibility, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP). In conclusion, we did not find that LEL had any clinically relevant effects on RA.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the effectiveness of 300 mW, 830 nm laser in the management of patients with chronic neck pain, in general practice, between May 1998 and June 1999. Data was obtained from 78 patients who rated self-assessed improvement of symptoms on a visual analog scale. An average improvement of 67.5 percent was found in 48 patients who reported a positive response to treatment. Number of treatments was the only factor that correlated with a positive response reaching a plateau by 15. Low level laser therapy using this wavelength and power of infrared laser may provide a nondrug, noninvasive option for the management of neck pain. This study lends support for a randomized-controlled trial to further evaluate this therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This pilot study was undertaken to test techniques of application of laser therapy, appropriate outcome measures and to determine effect sizes in order to facilitate the performance of a larger, clinical trial of laser therapy in chronic neck pain. Methods: We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of low level laser therapy in 20 patients with chronic neck pain. The primary outcome measure was change in a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] for pain. Other measures used included a Self-Reported Improvement in pain [SRI], measured by a VAS, Short-Form 36 Quality-of-Life questionnaire [SF-36], Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire [NPNPQ] and the McGill Pain Questionnaire [MPQ]. Measurements were taken at baseline, at the end of 7 weeks treatment and at 12 weeks from baseline. Results: We found a positive, pain-relieving effect in the treated group compared with those given placebo using the VAS [P < 0.039], SRI [P < 0.001], NPNPQ [P < 0.002] and the MPQ [P < 0.009]. The results of the SF-36 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients in the treated group experienced an average pain score improvement of 66.7% compared with 16.6% in the placebo group. Conclusion: Low-power laser therapy, at the parameters used in this pilot study, may provide a non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical therapy for chronic neck pain for patients in general practice. Further study of this technique in a large-scale trial would be justified on the basis of the findings of this pilot study.",

        "abstract": "We have studied the acceleration of cellular electron transfer by the combined magnetic and pulsed laser field at high peak power, but very low average intensity. To monitor the acceleration of electron transfer, the reduction of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) was followed using the EPR technique. It was shown that the electromagnetic field alone, or the magnetic field alone, produced no reduction of the TEMPO EPR signal. Only a combination between a laser of very low average intensity, but high peak power and a low-intensity magnetic field, reduced the TEMPO signal. The experiment was performed in a medium containing 107 Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria per cc. It was verified that at high average intensity the obtained reduction of the TEMPO by electromagnetic radiation was unaffected by the addition of a magnetic field. A possible mechanism underlying the photo-magnetic synergy is proposed.",

        "title": "Effects of Photobiomodulation Therapy Combined with Static Magnetic Field in Severe COVID-19 Patients Requiring Intubation: A Pragmatic Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Purpose We aimed to investigate the effects of photobiomodulation therapy combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) on the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and mortality rate of severe COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and assess its role in preserving respiratory muscles and modulating inflammatory processes. Patients and Methods We conducted a prospectively registered, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in severe COVID-19 ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF or a placebo daily throughout their ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of ICU stay, defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, diaphragm muscle function, and the changes in blood parameters, ventilatory parameters, and arterial blood gases. Results Thirty patients were included and equally randomized into the two groups. There were no significant differences in the length of ICU stay (mean difference, MD = \u22126.80; 95% CI = \u221218.71 to 5.11) between the groups. Among the secondary outcomes, significant differences were observed in diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein levels, lymphocyte count, and hemoglobin (p < 0.05). Conclusion Among severe COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay was not significantly different between the PBMT-sMF and placebo groups. In contrast, PBMT-sMF was significantly associated with reduced diaphragm atrophy, improved ventilatory parameters and lymphocyte count, and decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count.

        "abstract": "Researchers from across the world are seeking to develop effective treatments for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which arose as a major public health issue in 2019, and was declared a pandemic in early 2020. The pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple-organ failure, neurological problems, and thrombosis have all been linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) fatalities. The purpose of this review is to explore the rationale for using photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) of the particular wavelength 1068 nm as a therapy for COVID-19, investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. Our findings illustrate the efficacy of PBMT 1068 nm for cytoprotection, nitric oxide (NO) release, inflammation changes, improved blood flow, and the regulation of heat shock proteins (Hsp70). We propose, therefore, that PBMT 1068 is a potentially effective and innovative approach for avoiding severe and critical illness in COVID-19 patients, although further clinical evidence is required.",

        "abstract": "Background: Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) using devices to deliver red and/or near-infrared light to tissues has shown promising effects in clinical settings for respiratory diseases, including potential benefits in managing symptoms associated with COVID-19. Objective: To determine if at-home self-administered PBMT for patients with COVID-19 is safe and effective. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) carried out at home during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2020 to August 2021). The treatment group self-administered the Vielight RX Plus PBMT device (635 nm intranasal and 810 nm chest LEDs) and were monitored remotely. Eligible patients scored 4-7 (out of 7) for severity on the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-44). Patients were randomized equally to Control group receiving standard-of-care (SOC) only or Treatment group receiving SOC plus PBMT. The device was used for 20 min 2X/day for 5 days and, subsequently, once daily for 30 days. The primary end-point was time-to-recovery (days) based on WURSS-44 question 1, \"How sick do you feel today?\". Subgroup analysis was performed, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazards analysis were employed. Results: One hundred and ninety-nine eligible patients (18-65 years old) were divided into two subgroups as follows: 136 patients with 0-7 days of symptoms at baseline and 63 patients with 8-12 days of symptoms. Those with 0-7 days of symptoms at baseline recovered significantly faster with PBMT. The median for Treatment group was 18 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 13-20] versus the Control group 21 days (95% CI, 15-28), p = 0.050. The treatment:control hazard ratio was 1.495 (95% CI, 0.996-2.243), p = 0.054. Patients with symptom duration \u22657 days did not show any significant improvement. No deaths or severe adverse events (SAEs) occurred in the Treatment group, whereas there was 1 death and 3 SAEs requiring hospitalization in the Control group. Conclusions: Patients with \u22647 days of COVID-19 symptoms recovered significantly faster with PBMT compared to SOC. Beyond 7 days, PBMT showed no superiority over SOC.
