        "abstract": "Albuminuria reduction could be renoprotective in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, the current use of renin-angiotensin-system intervention is targeted to BP only. Therefore, this study investigated the adequacy of this approach in 1428 patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy from the placebo-controlled Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. Investigated were the extent of discordance in treatment effects on systolic BP (SBP) and albuminuria and its association with renal outcome in a multivariate Cox model. Among patients with a reduced SBP during treatment, a lack of albuminuria reduction was observed in 37, 26, and 51% (total, losartan, and placebo, respectively) at month 6. SBP or albuminuria reduction was associated with a lower risk for ESRD, whereas combined SBP and albuminuria reduction was associated with the lowest risk for events. Across all categories of SBP change, a progressively lower ESRD hazard ratio was observed with a larger albuminuria reduction. A lower residual level of albuminuria was also associated with lower ESRD risk. In conclusion, changes in albuminuria are not concordant in a substantial proportion of patients when titrated for BP. Meanwhile, the ESRD risk showed a clear dependence on albuminuria reduction. The ESRD risk also showed dependence on the residual level of albuminuria, even in patients who reached the current SBP target. Antihypertensive treatment that is aimed at improving renal outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy may therefore require a dual strategy, targeting both SBP and albuminuria reduction.",

        "abstract": "Kidney involvement with progressive loss of kidney function (Fabry nephropathy) is an important complication of Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder arising from deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase activity. Clinical trials have shown that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human \u03b1-galactosidase clears globotriaosylceramide from kidney cells, and can stabilize kidney function in patients with mild to moderate Fabry nephropathy. Recent trials show that patients with more advanced Fabry nephropathy and overt proteinuria do not respond as well to ERT alone, but can benefit from anti-proteinuric therapy given in conjunction with ERT. This review focuses on the use of enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase-alfa and agalsidase-beta in adults with Fabry nephropathy. The current results are reviewed and evaluated. The issues of dosing of enzyme replacement therapy, the use of adjunctive agents to control urinary protein excretion, and the individual factors that affect disease severity are reviewed.",

        "title": "The vitamin D system: a crosstalk between the heart and kidney",
        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) independently increases the rates of cardiovascular disease, whereas the severity of kidney disease correlates with increased cardiovascular morbidity and death. Vitamin D is modified in the liver and the kidney to its active form (1,25\u2010dihydroxyvitamin D) by the 25\u2010hydroxy vitamin D 1\u2010hydroxylase enzyme (CYP27B1). The activated vitamin D brings about its actions through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDRs and CYP27B1 have recently been shown to be expressed in several tissues, not directly involved in mineral homeostasis, including the cardiovascular, immune, and epithelial systems. The action of vitamin D in these tissues is implicated in the regulation of endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, and cardiac cell function, the renin\u2013angiotensin system, inflammatory and fibrotic pathways, and immune response. Impaired VDR activation and signalling results in cellular dysfunction in several organs and biological systems, which leads to reduced bone health, an increased risk for epithelial cancers, metabolic disease, and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Failure of cardiovascular VDR activation results in hypertension, accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification, cardiac hypertrophy with vascular rarification and fibrosis, and progressive renal dysfunction. An emerging body of evidence has prompted attention to the relationship between CKD, mineral bone disorder (CKD\u2010MBD), and cardiovascular disease in the new guidelines from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. Vitamin D receptor activators, commonly used to treat CKD\u2010MBD, and an appropriate treatment of vitamin D hormonal system failure in patients with CKD, may help to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nVitamin D deficiency, assessed as low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level, is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with various adverse health outcomes. Whether low 25(OH)D levels in patients with CKD are an independent risk factor for mortality remains to be studied in detail, and this was the objective of our work.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies.\n\n\nSETTING & POPULATION\nPatients with CKD. CKD was diagnosed mainly as decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES\nWe performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, ISI, and EMBASE to identify prospective studies reporting on 25(OH)D levels and mortality.\n\n\nPREDICTOR\n25(OH)D serum concentrations.\n\n\nOUTCOME\nAll-cause mortality.\n\n\nRESULTS\n10 studies with an overall sample of 6,853 patients with CKD were included. Relative risk of mortality per 10-ng/mL (25-nmol/L) increase in 25(OH)D level was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.91), with no indication of publication bias or significant heterogeneity (I(2) =15%; P = 0.3). Summary estimates for CKD cohorts with and without dialysis treatment showed homogeneous results (P = 0.9).\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nResults may be limited by heterogeneity, unconsidered confounders, and the observational design of the studies. Furthermore, publication bias by unpublished null findings on the association of 25(OH)D level and mortality cannot be ruled out and ascertainment of CKD was based largely on estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher 25(OH)D levels are associated with significantly improved survival in patients with CKD. Whether treatment of low 25(OH)D level using natural vitamin D supplementation improves survival in patients with CKD remains to be elucidated in randomized controlled trials.",

        "title": "A Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Identifying FGF23 Regulated Genes in the Kidney of a Mouse CKD Model",
        "abstract": "Elevations of circulating Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of renal failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Efforts to identify gene products whose transcription is directly regulated by FGF23 stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)/\u03b1-Klotho complexes in the kidney is confounded by both systemic alterations in calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism and intrinsic alterations caused by the underlying renal pathology in CKD. To identify FGF23 responsive genes in the kidney that might explain the association between FGF23 and adverse outcomes in CKD, we performed comparative genome wide analysis of gene expression profiles in the kidney of the Collagen 4 alpha 3 null mice (Col4a3\u2212/\u2212) model of progressive kidney disease with kidney expression profiles of Hypophosphatemic (Hyp) and FGF23 transgenic mouse models of elevated FGF23. The different complement of potentially confounding factors in these models allowed us to identify genes that are directly targeted by FGF23. This analysis found that \u03b1-Klotho, an anti-aging hormone and FGF23 co-receptor, was decreased by FGF23. We also identified additional FGF23-responsive transcripts and activation of networks associated with renal damage and chronic inflammation, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) signaling pathways. Finally, we found that FGF23 suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the kidney, thereby providing a pathway for FGF23 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. These gene products provide a possible mechanistic links between elevated FGF23 and pathways responsible for renal failure progression and cardiovascular diseases.",

        "title": "Ramipril Lowers Plasma FGF-23 in Patients with Diabetic Nephropathy",
        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Ramipril attenuates renal Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) expression, ameliorates proteinuria and normalizes serum phosphate in the diabetic Zucker rat with progressive renal disease suggesting that the renoprotective effect by this drug may be in part due to a FGF-23-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Methods: In this nonrandomized study, we tested whether ACE-inhibition reduces circulating FGF-23 in type-2 diabetics with stage-1 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and proteinuria. Intact FGF-23, the eGFR, proteinuria and the endothelium-dependent flow-mediated (FMD) response to ischemia and other parameters were measured at baseline and after 12-weeks of treatment with ramipril (n = 68) or amlodipine (n = 32). Results: Blood Pressure (BP) fell to a similar extent (p < 0.001) in the two groups. However, 24 h proteinuria and the FMD improved more (both p < 0.01) in ramipril-treated patients than in amlodipine-treated patients. Changes in proteinuria (r = 0.47) and in FMD (r = -0.49) by ramipril were closely associated (p < 0.001) with simultaneous changes in FGF-23 and this link was confirmed in multiple regression analyses. In these analyses, the relationship between FMD and proteinuria changes attained statistical significance (p < 0.01) only in a model excluding FGF-23 suggesting that endothelial dysfunction and FGF-23 share a common pathway conducive to renal damage. Conclusion: Findings in this study contribute to generate the hypothesis that FGF-23 may be implicated in proteinuria and in endothelial dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy (clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01738945)).",

        "title": "Fibroblast Growth Factor 23: a Bridge Between Bone Minerals and Renal Volume Handling",
        "abstract": "The work in this thesis addresses the interaction between the phosphate-regulating hormone Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) as key player in bone-mineral homeostasis and renal volume handling, mainly in the context of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). First, we elaborate on the role of vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its potential to increase effectiveness of RAAS-blockade. Next, we review the role of (excessive) sodium intake and why patients with CKD are particularly susceptible to the effects of sodium. Consecutively, we found that high FGF-23 levels are associated with an impaired antiproteinuric response to RAAS-blockade combined with a low sodium diet in patients with CKD. High FGF-23 concentrations are strongly associated with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality in CKD and hemodialysis patients. We add to this that also in renal transplant recipients high FGF-23 concentrations are correlated with adverse cardiovascular events, independent of existing, established risk factors. Moreover, FGF-23 levels correlated with markers of high volume status as NT-proBNP and copeptin. FGF-23 levels are extremely high in end stage renal disease. We found that part of the variance in these levels can be explained by ultrafiltration volume: patients who need more fluid withdrawal in dialysis, have far higher FGF-23 levels. The aforementioned chapters strongly suggest a link between volume status and FGF-23. We tested whether volume interventions, i.e. infusion of 2L saline or a 6-week sodium restriction, could in turn affect FGF-23 levels, this seems not to be the case. Although sodium interventions do not change FGF-23 concentrations, interventions aimed at phosphate intake do. Therefore, we examined the relation between these two minerals. Sodium intake and phosphate intake, as assessed by 24h-excretion, are strongly and robustly correlated across different populations: in renal transplant recipients, but also in diabetes patients and healthy volunteers. We interpret these findings in line with the observation that food products rich in sodium are also rich in phosphate. For example, processed-foods are notorious for their high sodium content, but they also contain a lot of phosphate-based additives which is far less commonly known. Expanding on healthy components of a healthy diet, we next investigate potassium. Healthy food choices as fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium. Following the observation that potassium supplementation appears to increase serum phosphate level, we hypothesized that potassium may lower FGF-23 levels. We confirmed this in the KaNa trial, where participants received potassium supplements or placebo combined with a fully-controlled diet. Several of our findings advocate changes in dietary intake, however this is difficult to achieve. In the multicenter, randomized controlled trial SUBLIME we deployed an approach that combined E-health technology based on self-regulation (behavioral change) theory, group meetings and individual coaching and we discuss the first results and feedback from participants in this thesis. In conclusion, this thesis places FGF-23 firmly as a bridge between sodium-volume and bone-mineral (phosphate) homeostasis.",
