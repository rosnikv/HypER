        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nRimonabant, a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker, may reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in patients who are overweight or obese.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of rimonabant with placebo each in conjunction with diet and exercise for sustained changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors over 2 years.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 3045 obese (body mass index > or =30) or overweight (body mass index >27 and treated or untreated hypertension or dyslipidemia) adult patients at 64 US and 8 Canadian clinical research centers from August 2001 to April 2004.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAfter a 4-week single-blind placebo plus diet (600 kcal/d deficit) run-in period, patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg/d of rimonabant, or 20 mg/d of rimonabant for 1 year. Rimonabant-treated patients were rerandomized to receive placebo or continued to receive the same rimonabant dose while the placebo group continued to receive placebo during year 2.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBody weight change over year 1 and prevention of weight regain during year 2. Additional efficacy measures included changes in waist circumference, plasma lipid levels, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt year 1, the completion rate was 309 (51%) patients in the placebo group, 620 (51%) patients in the 5 mg of rimonabant group, and 673 (55%) patients in the 20 mg of rimonabant group. Compared with the placebo group, the 20 mg of rimonabant group produced greater mean (SEM) reductions in weight (-6.3 [0.2] kg vs -1.6 [0.2] kg; P<.001), waist circumference (-6.1 [0.2] cm vs -2.5 [0.3] cm; P<.001), and level of triglycerides (percentage change, -5.3 [1.2] vs 7.9 [2.0]; P<.001) and a greater increase in level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (percentage change, 12.6 [0.5] vs 5.4 [0.7]; P<.001). Patients who were switched from the 20 mg of rimonabant group to the placebo group during year 2 experienced weight regain while those who continued to receive 20 mg of rimonabant maintained their weight loss and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. Use of different imputation methods to account for the high rate of dropouts in all 3 groups yielded similar results. Rimonabant was generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse event was nausea (11.2% for the 20 mg of rimonabant group vs 5.8% for the placebo group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this multicenter trial, treatment with 20 mg/d of rimonabant plus diet for 2 years promoted modest but sustained reductions in weight and waist circumference and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the trial was limited by a high drop-out rate and longer-term effects of the drug require further study. Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00029861.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nAbdominal obesity is associated with metabolic abnormalities and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, no obesity management strategy has demonstrated the ability to slow progression of coronary disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether weight loss and metabolic effects of the selective cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist rimonabant reduces progression of coronary disease in patients with abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS\nRandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-group, parallel-group trial (enrollment December 2004-December 2005) comparing rimonabant with placebo in 839 patients at 112 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients received dietary counseling, were randomized to receive rimonabant (20 mg daily) or matching placebo, and underwent coronary intravascular ultrasonography at baseline (n = 839) and study completion (n = 676).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy parameter was change in percent atheroma volume (PAV); the secondary efficacy parameter was change in normalized total atheroma volume (TAV).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the rimonabant vs placebo groups, PAV (95% confidence interval [CI]) increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.54%) vs 0.51% (0.22% to 0.80%) (P = .22), respectively, and TAV decreased 2.2 mm3 (-4.09 to -0.24) vs an increase of 0.88 mm3 (-1.03 to 2.79) (P = .03). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, imputing results based on baseline characteristics for patients not completing the trial, PAV increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.55%) vs 0.57% (0.29% to 0.84%) (P = .13), and TAV decreased 1.95 mm3 (-3.8 to -0.10) vs an increase of 1.19 mm3 (-0.73 to 3.12) (P = .02). Rimonabant-treated patients had a larger reduction in body weight (4.3 kg [-5.1 to -3.5] vs 0.5 kg [-1.3 to 0.3]) and greater decrease in waist circumference (4.5 cm [-5.4 to -3.7] vs 1.0 cm [-1.9 to -0.2]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 5.8 mg/dL (4.9 to 6.8) (22.4%) vs 1.8 mg/dL (0.9 to 2.7) (6.9%) (P < .001), and median triglyceride levels decreased 24.8 mg/dL (-35.4 to -17.3) (20.5%) vs 8.9 mg/dL (-14.2 to -1.8) (6.2%) (P < .001). Rimonabant-treated patients had greater decreases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (1.3 mg/dL [-1.7 to -1.2] [50.3%] vs 0.9 mg/dL [-1.4 to -0.5] [30.9%]) and less increase in glycated hemoglobin levels (0.11% [0.02% to 0.20%] vs 0.40% [0.31% to 0.49%]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). Psychiatric adverse effects were more common in the rimonabant group (43.4% vs 28.4%, P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter 18 months of treatment, the study failed to show an effect for rimonabant on disease progression for the primary end point (PAV) but showed a favorable effect on the secondary end point (TAV). Determining whether rimonabant is useful in management of coronary disease will require additional imaging and outcomes trials, which are currently under way.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00124332.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Rimonabant, the first selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, improves cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese patients. ADAGIO-Lipids assessed the effect of rimonabant on cardiometabolic risk factors and intraabdominal and liver fat. Methods and Results\u2014803 abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides [TG] or reduced high-density lipoprotein\u2013cholesterol [HDL-C]) were randomized to placebo or rimonabant 20 mg/d for 1 year. HDL-C and TG were coprimary end points. Intraabdominal (visceral) and liver fat were measured by computed tomography in a subgroup of 231 patients. In total, 73% of rimonabant- and 70% of placebo-treated patients completed the study treatment. Rimonabant 20 mg produced significantly greater changes from baseline versus placebo in HDL-C (+7.4%) and TG levels (\u221218%; P<0.0001), as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL particle sizes, apolipoprotein A1 and B, HDL2, HDL3, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels (all P<0.05). Rimonabant decreased abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) cross-sectional area by 5.1% compared to placebo (P<0.005), with a greater reduction in visceral AT (\u221210.1% compared to placebo; P<0.0005), thereby reducing the ratio of visceral/subcutaneous AT (P<0.05). Rimonabant significantly reduced liver fat content (liver/spleen attenuation ratio; P<0.005). Systolic (\u22123.3 mm Hg) and diastolic (\u22122.4 mm Hg) blood pressure were significantly reduced with rimonabant versus placebo (P<0.0001). The safety profile of rimonabant was consistent with previous studies; gastrointestinal, nervous system, psychiatric, and general adverse events were more common with rimonabant 20 mg. Conclusions\u2014In abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia, rimonabant 20 mg significantly improved multiple cardiometabolic risk markers and induced significant reductions in both intraabdominal and liver fat.",

We survey the actions of endocannabinoids on food intake and body weight, as well as on the metabolic complications of visceral obesity, including fatty liver, insulin resistance and dyslipidemias. Special emphasis is placed on weighing the relative importance of CB1 receptors located in peripheral tissues versus the central nervous system in mediating the metabolic effects of endocannabinoids. Finally, we review recent observations that indicate that peripherally restricted CB1 receptor antagonists retain efficacy in reducing weight and improving metabolic abnormalities in mouse models of obesity without causing behavioural effects predictive of neuropsychiatric side effects in humans.",

        "abstract": "The disposition of 1-(8-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-(4-chlorophenyl)-9H- purin-6-yl)-4-(ethylamino)-piperidine-4-carboxamide (CP-945,598), an orally active antagonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, was studied after a single 25-mg oral dose of [14C]CP-945,598 to healthy human subjects. Serial blood samples and complete urine and feces were collected up to 672 h after dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity was 60.1 \u00b1 12.8 from the urine and feces, with the majority of the dose excreted in the feces. The absorption of CP-945,598 in humans was slow with Tmax at 6 h. Less than 2% of the dose was recovered as unchanged drug in the combined excreta, suggesting that CP-945,598 is extensively metabolized. The primary metabolic pathway of CP-945,598 involved N-de-ethylation to form an N-desethyl metabolite (M1), which was then subsequently metabolized by amide hydrolysis (M2), N-hydroxylation (M3), piperidine ring hydroxylation (M6), and ribose conjugation (M9). M3 was further metabolized to oxime (M4) and keto (M5) metabolites. M1, M4, and M5 were the major circulating metabolites, with AUC(0\u201348) values 4.7-, 1.5-, and 1.1-fold greater than that of CP-945,598. M1, M2, and M9 accounted for 5.6, 33.6, and 6.30% of the dose, respectively, in excreta. The results from in vitro experiments with recombinant isoforms suggested that the oxidative metabolism of CP-945,598 to M1 is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4/3A5. The molecular docking study showed that the N-ethyl moiety of CP-945,598 can access to the heme iron-oxo of CYP3A4 in an energetically favored orientation. Together, these data suggest that CP-945,598 is well absorbed and eliminated largely by CYP3A4/3A5-catalyzed metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been implicated in cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy associated with heart failure, and atherosclerosis, in addition to its recognized role in metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Numerous studies have presented contradictory findings about the role of HO-1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, we explored the role of HO-1 in myocardial dysfunction, myofibril structure, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model in mice systemically overexpressing HO-1 (Tg-HO-1) or mutant HO-1 (Tg-mutHO-1). The diabetic mouse model was induced by multiple peritoneal injections of STZ. Two months after injection, left ventricular (LV) function was measured by echocardiography. In addition, molecular biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated using classical molecular biological/biochemical techniques. Mice with DCM exhibited severe LV dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, aberrant cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and increased levels of HO-1. In addition, we determined that systemic overexpression of HO-1 ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in DCM mice. Furthermore, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation is normally inhibited in DCM, but overexpression of the HO-1 gene restored the phosphorylation of these kinases to normal levels. In contrast, the functions of HO-1 in DCM were significantly reversed by overexpression of mutant HO-1. This study underlines the unique roles of HO-1, including the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and the enhancement of autophagy, in the pathogenesis of DCM.",

        "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is frequently the consequence of sustained, abnormal neurohormonal, and mechanical stress and remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The key pathophysiological process leading to HF is cardiac remodeling, a term referring to maladaptation to cardiac stress at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. HF and many of the conditions that predispose one to HF are associated with oxidative stress. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart can directly lead to increased necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes which subsequently induce cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Nuclear factor-erythroid-2- (NF-E2-) related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that controls the basal and inducible expression of a battery of antioxidant genes and other cytoprotective phase II detoxifying enzymes that are ubiquitously expressed in the cardiovascular system. Emerging evidence has revealed that Nrf2 and its target genes are critical regulators of cardiovascular homeostasis via the suppression of oxidative stress, which is the key player in the development and progression of HF. The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence that activation of Nrf2 enhances endogenous antioxidant defenses and counteracts oxidative stress-associated cardiac remodeling and HF.",

        "abstract": "Silymarin (SM), an extract from the Silybum marianum (milk thistle) plant containing various flavonolignans (with silybin being the major one), has received a tremendous amount of attention over the last decade as a herbal remedy for liver treatment. In many cases, the antioxidant properties of SM are considered to be responsible for its protective actions. Possible antioxidant mechanisms of SM are evaluated in this review. (1) Direct scavenging free radicals and chelating free Fe and Cu are mainly effective in the gut. (2) Preventing free radical formation by inhibiting specific ROS-producing enzymes, or improving an integrity of mitochondria in stress conditions, are of great importance. (3) Maintaining an optimal redox balance in the cell by activating a range of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants, mainly via Nrf2 activation is probably the main driving force of antioxidant (AO) action of SM. (4) Decreasing inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathways is an emerging mechanism of SM protective effects in liver toxicity and various liver diseases. (5) Activating vitagenes, responsible for synthesis of protective molecules, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), thioredoxin and sirtuins and providing additional protection in stress conditions deserves more attention. (6) Affecting the microenvironment of the gut, including SM-bacteria interactions, awaits future investigations. (7) In animal nutrition and disease prevention strategy, SM alone, or in combination with other hepatho-active compounds (carnitine, betaine, vitamin B12, etc.), might have similar hepatoprotective effects as described in human nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Silybin is a secondary metabolite isolated from the seeds of blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum) that has anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antifibrotic, and antitumor properties. Here, we showed that silybin protected against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) by improving mitochondrial function through the regulation of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) expression. Male SV129 and SIRT3 knockout (KO) mice were administered a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of cisplatin with or without treatment with silybin. Moreover, cultured HK2 cells were used to evaluate mitochondrial morphology and function. Our data suggested that silybin enhanced SIRT3 expression after cisplatin administration both in vivo and in vitro. Silybin treatment improved mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in wild-type, but not SIRT3-defective, cells and mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that silybin markedly attenuated cisplatin-induced AKI and tubular cell apoptosis and improved cell regeneration in a SIRT3-dependent manner. Collectively, these results suggest that silybin is a pharmacological activator of SIRT3 capable of protecting against cisplatin-induced tubular cell apoptosis and AKI by improving mitochondrial function. Thus, silybin could serve as a potential clinical renoprotective adjuvant treatment in cisplatin chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: Amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy. Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is a novel mitochondrial protective factor. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether SIRT3 protects against hyperglycemia-induced AFSCs damage and enhances the therapeutic efficiency of AFSCs in diabetic nephropathy. Methods: To establish the diabetic nephropathy model, db/ db mice were used. AFSCs were obtained and transplanted into the kidney tissue of db/ db mice. Gain-of-function assay with SIRT3 overexpression was performed in AFSCs via adenoviral transfections (Ad/SIRT3). Cellular viability and apoptosis were measured via MTT, TUNEL assay and western blotting. Mitochondrial function was assessed via JC1 staining, mPTP opening assay, mitochondrial respiratory function analysis, and immunofluorescence analysis of cyt-c. Mitophagy was assessed via western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Renal histopathology and morphometric analysis were conducted via H&E, Masson and PASM staining. Kidney function was detected via ELISA assay, western blotting and qPCR. Results: SIRT3 was downregulated in AFSCs under high glucose stimulation, where its expression was positively correlated with AFSCs survival and proliferation. Regaining SIRT3 activated mitophagy protecting AFSCs against high glucose-induced apoptosis via preserving mitochondrial function. Transplanting SIRT3-overexpressing AFSCs in db/db mice improved the abnormalities in glucose metabolic parameters, including the levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c and inflammatory markers. In addition, the engraftment of SIRT3-modified AFSCs also reversed renal function, decreased renal hypertrophy, and ameliorated renal histological changes in db/db mice. Functional studies confirmed that SIRT3-modified AFSCs promoted glomerulus survival and reduced renal fibrosis. Conclusion: Collectively, our results demonstrate that AFSCs may be a promising therapeutic treatment for ameliorating diabetes and the development of diabetic nephropathy and that the overexpression of SIRT3 in AFSCs may further increase the efficiency of stem cell-based therapy.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage chronic renal disease (ESRD), which requires the use of replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplant) in life-threatening conditions. In ESRD, irreversible changes in the kidneys are associated with systemic changes of proinflammatory nature and dysfunctions of internal organs, skeletal muscles, and integumentary tissues. The common components of ESRD pathogenesis, regardless of the initial nosology, are (1) local (in the kidneys) and systemic chronic low-grade inflammation (ChLGI) as a risk factor for diabetic kidney disease and its progression to ESRD, (2) inflammation of the classical type characteristic of primary and secondary autoimmune glomerulonephritis and infectious recurrent pyelonephritis, as well as immune reactions in kidney allograft rejection, and (3) chronic systemic inflammation (ChSI), pathogenetically characterized by latent microcirculatory disorders and manifestations of paracoagulation. The development of ChSI is closely associated with programmed hemodialysis in ESRD, as well as with the systemic autoimmune process. Consideration of ESRD pathogenesis from the standpoint of the theory of general pathological processes opens up the scope not only for particular but also for universal approaches to conducting pathogenetic therapies and diagnosing and predicting systemic complications in severe nephropathies.",

        "title": "Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviate Podocyte Injury in Diabetic Kidney Disease by Modulating Mitophagy via the SIRT1-PGC-1alpha-TFAM Pathway",
        "abstract": "The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has become a new strategy for treating diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the role of placenta derived mesenchymal stem cells (P-MSCs) in DKD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic application and molecular mechanism of P-MSCs on DKD from the perspective of podocyte injury and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy at the animal, cellular, and molecular levels. Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of podocyte injury-related markers and mitophagy-related markers, SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and TFAM. Knockdown, overexpression, and rescue experiments were performed to verify the underlying mechanism of P-MSCs in DKD. Mitochondrial function was detected by flow cytometry. The structure of autophagosomes and mitochondria were observed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, we constructed a streptozotocin-induced DKD rat model and injected P-MSCs into DKD rats. Results showed that as compared with the control group, exposing podocytes to high-glucose conditions aggravated podocyte injury, represented by a decreased expression of Podocin along with increased expression of Desmin, and inhibited PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, manifested as a decreased expression of Beclin1, the LC3II/LC3I ratio, Parkin, and PINK1 associated with an increased expression of P62. Importantly, these indicators were reversed by P-MSCs. In addition, P-MSCs protected the structure and function of autophagosomes and mitochondria. P-MSCs increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content and decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, P-MSCs alleviated podocyte injury and mitophagy inhibition by enhancing the expression of the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1-TFAM pathway. Finally, we injected P-MSCs into streptozotocin-induced DKD rats. The results revealed that the application of P-MSCs largely reversed the markers related to podocyte injury and mitophagy and significantly increased the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and TFAM compared with the DKD group. In conclusion, P-MSCs ameliorated podocyte injury and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy inhibition in DKD by activating the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1-TFAM pathway.",

        "title": "JiangyaTongluo decoction ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis via regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1/mitophagy axis in hypertensive nephropathy",
        "abstract": "Introduction With the increasing prevalence of hypertension, the incidence of kidney diseases is also increasing, resulting in a serious public burden. Jiangya Tongluo decoction (JYTL), a recognized prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is commonly used to calm an overactive liver and reduce excess yang, while also promoting blood flow to alleviate obstructions in the meridians. Previous research has indicated that JYTL may help mitigate kidney damage caused by hypertension; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly assessed. Methods First, an amalgamation of UPLC-QE/MS and network pharmacology techniques was employed to pinpoint potential active components, primary targets, and crucial action mechanisms of JYTL in treating hypertensive nephropathy (HN). Then, we used spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) to evaluate the efficacy of JYTL on HN with valsartan as a positive reference. We also conducted DCFH-DA fluorescence staining in rat renal tissues to detect the level of ROS. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate further the effect of JYTL decoction on key targets and signaling pathways. Results Through UPLC-QE/MS and network analysis, 189 active ingredients and 5 hub targets were identified from JYTL. GSEA in the MitoCarta3.0 database and PPI network analysis revealed that JYTL predominantly engages in the Sirt1-mitophagy signaling pathway. Tanshinone iia, quercetin, and adenosine in JYTL are the main active ingredients for treating HN. In vivo validation showed that JYTL decoction could improve kidney function, ameliorate tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), and improve mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS production and regulating mitochondrial dynamics in SHRs. JYTL treatment could also increase the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf1, and TFAM, and activate PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Conclusion JYTL decoction may exert renal function protective and anti-fibrosis effects in HN by ameliorating mitochondrial function and regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1-mitophagy pathway.",
