        "abstract": "Randomized, controlled and double-blind study of 36 patients aimed at the evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of MTX in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Twenty-eight patients completed the study period: 14 in the MTX group and 14 in the placebo group. The patients treated with MTX presented a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in pain, grip strength and functional ability when compared to placebo treated patients. Mild adverse effects were observed in 4 patients treated with MTX and in 2 patients treated with placebo. These findings support other studies and give to methotrexate a relevant position in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, owing to its convenient posology, beneficial effectivity and favourable toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disease primarily manifesting as chronic synovitis, subsequently leading to a change in joint integrity. Progressive disability and systemic complications are strongly associated with a decreased quality of life. To maintain function and health in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, early, aggressive and guided immunosuppressive therapy is required to induce clinical remission. Antirheumatic drugs are capable of controlling synovial inflammation and are therefore named 'disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs' (DMARDs). This article aims to bridge the beginning of DMARD therapy with agents such as methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, injectable gold and (hydroxy)chloroquine with biological therapies, and with the new era of kinase inhibitors. Mechanisms of action, as well as advantages and disadvantages of DMARDs, are discussed with respect to the current literature and current recommendations.",

The orally administered small molecule inhibitor, tofacitinib, is the first drug to target the JAK/STAT pathway for entry into the armamentarium of the medical therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. The introduction of tofacitinib into general rheumatologic practice coupled with increasing understanding that additional cellular signal transduction pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways as well as spleen tyrosine kinase also contribute to immune-mediated inflammatory in rheumatoid arthritis makes it likely that further development of orally administered protein kinase small molecule inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis will occur in the near future.",

In that regard, altered function of these cells can generally be traced back to defective regulation of individual signal transduction pathways, involving primarily the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, [35] the Janus kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription pathway (JAK/STAT) [6-9], the Toll-like receptor pathway [1012] and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/PKB/mTOR) pathway [13-16]. In addition, deregulated signal transduction in the cells from RA joint tissues is also likely to involve \u201ccross-talk\u201d between signaling cascades leading to continuous activation between these various receptor-mediated signaling pathways [4].",

        "abstract": "Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are generally thought to be responsible for driving the progression of synovial joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These cytokines activate several signal transduction pathways, including the Janus kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT), Stress-Activated/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK/MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathways which regulate numerous cellular responses. However, cytokine gene expression, matrix metalloproteinase gene expression and aberrant immune cell and synoviocyte survival via reduced apoptosis are most critical in the context of inflammation characteristic of RA and OA. Negative regulation of JAK/STAT signaling is controlled by Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins. SOCS is produced at lower levels in RA and OA. In addition, gaining further insight into the role played in RA and OA pathology by the inhibitors of the apoptosis protein family, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, -2 (c-IAP1, c-IAP2), X (cross)-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS), and survivin (human) as well as SOCS appears to be a worthy endeavor going forward.",

        "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokine activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signal transduction pathway is a critical event in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Under normal conditions, JAK/STAT signaling reflects the influence of negative regulators of JAK/STAT, exemplified by the suppressor of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STAT. However, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) both of these regulators are dysfunctional. Thus, continuous activation of JAK/STAT signaling in RA synovial joints results in the elevated level of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression, increased frequency of apoptotic chondrocytes and most prominently \u2018apoptosis resistance\u2019 in the inflamed synovial tissue. Tofacitinib, a JAK small molecule inhibitor, with selectivity for JAK2/JAK3 was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the therapy of RA. Importantly, tofacitinib has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy for RA in the post-US FDA-approval surveillance period. Of note, the success of tofacitinib has spurred the development of JAK1, JAK2 and other JAK3-selective small molecule inhibitors, some of which have also entered the clinical setting, whereas other JAK inhibitors are currently being evaluated in RA clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor peficitinib versus placebo in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase III study, patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, peficitinib 100 mg once daily or peficitinib 150 mg once daily with MTX for 52 weeks. Based on baseline randomisation, at week 12, non-responders receiving placebo were switched to peficitinib until the end of treatment; the remaining patients were switched to peficitinib at week 28. Primary efficacy variables were American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response rate at week 12/early termination (ET) and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score (mTSS) at week 28/ET. Results 519 patients were randomised and treated. Significantly more (p<0.001) peficitinib (58.6%, 100 mg; 64.4%, 150 mg) than placebo (21.8%) recipients achieved ACR20 response at week 12/ET. Significantly lower (p<0.001) mean changes from baseline in mTSS at week 28/ET occurred in peficitinib (1.62, 100 mg; 1.03, 150 mg) than placebo (3.37) recipients. Peficitinib was associated with haematological and biochemical parameter changes, and increased incidence of serious infections and herpes zoster-related disease. One death from suicide occurred in a patient in the placebo group after switching to peficitinib 100 mg. Conclusions In Japanese patients with RA and inadequate response to MTX, peficitinib demonstrated significant superiority versus placebo in reducing RA symptoms and suppressing joint destruction. Peficitinib had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with no new safety signals compared with other JAK inhibitors. Trial registration number NCT02305849.",

Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled from 2007 until October 2020. Reported HZ events were assigned to ongoing treatments or those terminated within 1\u2009month prior to the HZ event. Exposure-adjusted event rates (EAERs) of HZ were calculated per 1000 patient years (py) and adjusted HRs with 95% CIs computed. Inverse probability weights (IPW) were used to adjust for confounding by indication. Results Data of 13\u2009991 patients (62\u2009958 py) were analysed, with 559\u2009HZ events reported in 533 patients. The EAER of HZ was highest for tsDMARDs (21.5, 95%\u2009CI 16.4 to 27.9), followed by B cell targeted therapy (10.3, 95%\u2009CI 8.0 to 13.0), monoclonal antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies (9.3, 95%\u2009CI 7.7 to 11.2), interleukin 6 inhibitors (8.8, 95%\u2009CI 6.9 to 11.0), soluble TNF receptor fusion protein (8.6, 95%\u2009CI 6.8 to 10.8), T cell costimulation modulator (8.4, 95%\u2009CI 5.9 to 11.8) and csDMARDs (7.1, 95%\u2009CI 6.0 to 8.3).

Methods Using Japanese claims data, patients with RA were enrolled in this study if they had at least one ICD-10 code (M05 or M06), were new users of JAKIs, bDMARDs or MTX between July 2013 and July 2020 and being 18 years old or older. The incidence rate (IR), IR ratio and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR (95% CI)) of cardiovascular events including venous thromboembolism, arterial thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction and stroke were calculated. A time-dependent Cox regression model adjusted for patient characteristics at baseline was used to calculate aHR. Results In 53\u2009448 cases, IRs/1000 patient-years of the overall cardiovascular events were 10.1, 6.8, 5.4, 9.1 and 11.3 under the treatments with JAKIs, bDMARDs, TNFIs, non-TNFIs and MTX, respectively. The adjusted HRs of JAKIs for overall cardiovascular events were 1.7 (1.1 to 2.5) versus TNFIs without MTX and 1.7 (1.1 to 2.7) versus TNFIs with MTX. Conclusions Among patients with RA, individuals using JAKIs had a significantly higher risk of overall cardiovascular events than TNFIs users, which was attributed to the difference in the risk between JAKIs and TNFIs versus MTX. These data should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations associated with the claims database.",
