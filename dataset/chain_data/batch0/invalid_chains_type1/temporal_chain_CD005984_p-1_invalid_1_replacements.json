        "title": "Impacts of long\u2010term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal cytokines during remission in patients with Crohn's disease: A prospective study",
        "abstract": "Background: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long\u2010term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. Methods: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low\u2010fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non\u2010EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. Results: On an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non\u2010EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1\u2010year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non\u2010EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)\u20101&bgr;, IL\u20106, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr; levels significantly increased with time in the non\u2010EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL\u20101&bgr;, P = 0.02; IL\u20106, P = 0.002; TNF\u2010&agr;, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. Conclusions: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.

        "abstract": "Enteral nutrition has long been a therapeutic alternative often used in adult Crohn's disease patients to obtain remission or clinical response, especially in those not responding to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids. However, the increasing use of immunosuppressors (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.), and the advent of biotherapies (especially anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies), decreased its use in adult Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, enteral nutrition remains of interest in patients presenting concomitant malnutrition (in particular in nonobstructed patients needing surgery), or in those intolerant or who failed to other therapeutics. In addition, recent studies provide data indicating its potential interest in maintenance therapy in selected patients groups. Finally, future research (in particular in the field of immuno- or pharmaconutrition) could lead to enteral formula's improvement, with better tolerance and acceptability, as well as increased efficacy.",

        "title": "Maintenance treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease with a polymeric feed rich in TGF-\u03b2",
        "abstract": "Rationale: Dietetic intervention with polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-\u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22) represents a relatively satisfactory therapeutic modality in adult patients with mild to moderately active Crohn\u2019s disease. However, there is no information concerning long-term results of this special diet. The aim of this study was to compare the results of the administration of a special diet (Modulen IBD) rich in TGF-\u03b22 with those of the administration of mesalamine, in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Methods: Of the 83 patients initially included in the study, 76 (91.5%) [36 in the Modulen and 30 in the mesalamine arm] completed the trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either two meals (2X50g) of Modulen IBD plus two regular meals per day (43 patients) or mesalamine (800mg three times a day) (40 patients) for six months. Patients were assessed at sixth months after initiation of the trial. Relapse was defined as a Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index of greater than 150 points or at least 60 points over baseline. Various anthropometric parameters and serum estimations including ESR, CRP, platelets, albumin, vitamin B12 and folic acid were carried out at the beginning of the trial and after six months. Results: Twenty-five patients in the Modulen arm (69%) continued to be in remission after six months compared with 18(60%) receiving mesalamine (no significant differences). Among patients with relapse the mean time to relapse was 103 days for those treated with mesalamine and 123 days for those treated with Modulen (no significant differences). Conclusion:Modulen-IBD treatment reduced relapse rate to a better degree compared with mesalamine treatment, although statistical significance was not achieved.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a poorly understood chronic immune disorder for which there is no medical cure. Milk and colostrum are rich sources of bioactives with immunomodulatory properties. Here we compared the therapeutic effects of oral delivery of bovine milk-derived iron-saturated lactoferrin (Fe-bLF), angiogenin, osteopontin (OPN), colostrum whey protein, Modulen IBD (Nestle Healthsciences, Rhodes, Australia), and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-enriched milk fat in a mouse model of dextran sulfate-induced colitis. The CLA-enriched milk fat significantly increased mouse body weights after 24d of treatment, reduced epithelium damage, and downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and nitrous oxide. Modulen IBD most effectively decreased the clinical score at d 12, and Modulen IBD and OPN most effectively lowered the inflammatory score. Myeloperoxidase activity that denotes neutrophil infiltration was significantly lower in mice fed Modulen IBD, OPN, angiogenin, and Fe-bLF. A significant decrease in the numbers of T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and a significant decrease in cytokine expression were observed in mice fed the treatment diets compared with dextran sulfate administered mice. The Fe-bLF, CLA-enriched milk fat, and Modulen IBD inhibited intestinal angiogenesis. In summary, each of the milk components attenuated IBD in mice, but with differing effectiveness against specific disease parameters.",

The source paper investigates the effect of Modulen IBD on maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Although both papers involve Modulen IBD, the current paper does not directly build upon or depend on the source paper's findings. Instead, it investigates a different aspect of Modulen IBD's effects in a different context. Therefore, it is considered partially dependent on the source paper's findings, but the connection is not direct."

        "abstract": "Although the current doctrine of IBD pathogenesis proposes an interaction between environmental factors and gut microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, dietary exposures have attracted recent interest and are, at least in part, likely to explain the rapid rise in disease incidence and prevalence. The D-ECCO working group along with other ECCO experts with expertise in nutrition, microbiology, physiology, and medicine reviewed the evidence investigating the role of diet and nutritional therapy in the onset, perpetuation, and management of IBD. A narrative topical review is presented where evidence pertinent to the topic is summarised collectively under three main thematic domains: i] the role of diet as an environmental factor in IBD aetiology; ii] the role of diet as induction and maintenance therapy in IBD; and iii] assessment of nutritional status and supportive nutritional therapy in IBD. A summary of research gaps for each of these thematic domains is proposed, which is anticipated to be agenda-setting for future research in the area of diet and nutrition in IBD.",

        "abstract": "Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease which bears a significant burden on society and individuals. Despite the high prevalence of FD, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood and the treatment options are limited and unsatisfactory. In the absence of effective pharmacological treatments for FD, non-pharmacological approaches, including: reassurance, lifestyle modification, psychotherapy, dietary interventions, medical food, acupuncture, and electrical stimulation and modulation are sought after by many physicians and FD patients. In this article, we review clinical studies which investigate non-pharmacological therapies for FD. We will also discuss potential mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of these non-pharmacological approaches. Though the evidences to support the routine use of the non-pharmacological management is still lacking, the non-invasive nature and potentially minimal side-effects of these therapies may be attractive in the FD management. In order to confirm the clinical effectiveness of these non-pharmacological approaches, more well-conducted, methodologically rigorous, and large-scaled clinical trials are required.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common and frequently-occurring disease in internal medicine. It is known that Liujunzi decoction and acupuncture are widely used in the treatment of FD, but there are few studies on the combination of Liujunzi decoction and acupuncture in the treatment of FD, and its safety and efficacy are still controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with Liujunzi decoction in the treatment of FD. Methods: We designed a prospective randomized controlled trial. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. Patients with FD were randomly assigned to the treatment group of acupuncture combined with Liujunzi Decoction (the experimental group) and the treatment group of Liujunzi Decoction (the control group) in a ratio of 1:1. Outcome indicators were Nepean Dyspepsia Index, the MOS item short from health survey, and adverse reactions. Finally, SPSS 18.0 software would be used for statistical analysis of the data. Discussion: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with Liujunzi Decoction in the treatment of FD and provide clinical basis for the use of acupuncture combined with Liujunzi Decoction in the treatment of FD.
