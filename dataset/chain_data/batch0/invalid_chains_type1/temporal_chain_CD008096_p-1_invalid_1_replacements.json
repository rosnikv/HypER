        "abstract": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have largely replaced nasogastric tubes (NGT) for nutritional support of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing curative (chemo)radiotherapy without any good scientific basis. A randomized trial was conducted to compare PEG tubes and NGT in terms of nutritional outcomes, complications, patient satisfaction and cost. The study was closed early because of poor accrual, predominantly due to patients\u2019 reluctance to be randomized. There were 33 patients eligible for analysis. Nutritional support with both tubes was good. There were no significant differences in overall complication rates, chest infection rates or in patients\u2019 assessment of their overall quality of life. The cost of a PEG tube was 10 times that of an NGT. The duration of use of PEG tubes was significantly longer, a median 139\u2003days compared with a median 66\u2003days for NGT. We found no evidence to support the routine use of PEG tubes over NGT in this patient group.",

        "abstract": "Objective To understand the impact of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement timing on tube duration, weight loss, and disease control in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Setting A tertiary academic center. Study Design Historical cohort study. Subjects and Methods Seventy-four patients with HNC were reviewed. Patients underwent cisplatinum-based chemoradiation therapy with or without surgical resection. They received a PEG tube either before radiation therapy began (prophylactic) or after (reactive). Patients were matched on the basis of age, gender, TNM stage, tumor subsite, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and chemoradiation dose. Results Patients receiving reactive PEG tubes had them in place for fewer days than those placed prophylactically (227 vs 139 days, P < .01). There was no difference in percentage weight loss at 2, 6, or 12 months. There was no difference in survival or disease control between the groups. Conclusions Reactive PEG tube placement may afford patients a shorter duration of usage without incurring greater weight loss or poorer oncologic outcomes.",

        "title": "Nutritional Interventions in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy: A Narrative Review",
        "abstract": "The present review aimed to define the role of nutritional interventions in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in HNC patients undergoing CRT as well as their impact on CRT-related toxicity and survival. Head and neck cancer patients are frequently malnourished at the time of diagnosis and prior to the beginning of treatment. In addition, chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) causes or exacerbates symptoms, such as alteration or loss of taste, mucositis, xerostomia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, with consequent worsening of malnutrition. Nutritional counseling (NC) and oral nutritional supplements (ONS) should be used to increase dietary intake and to prevent therapy-associated weight loss and interruption of radiation therapy. If obstructing cancer and/or mucositis interfere with swallowing, enteral nutrition should be delivered by tube. However, it seems that there is not sufficient evidence to determine the optimal method of enteral feeding. Prophylactic feeding through nasogastric tube or percutaneous gastrostomy to prevent weight loss, reduce dehydration and hospitalizations, and avoid treatment breaks has become relatively common. Compared to reactive feeding (patients are supported with oral nutritional supplements and when it is impossible to maintain nutritional requirements enteral feeding via a NGT or PEG is started), prophylactic feeding does not offer advantages in terms of nutritional outcomes, interruptions of radiotherapy and survival. Overall, it seems that further adequate prospective, randomized studies are needed to define the better nutritional intervention in head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.",

        "title": "Indicators for Enteral Nutrition Use and Prophylactic Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Placement in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy",
        "abstract": "Background: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a major risk factor for malnutrition and dehydration in patients with head and neck cancer. Enteral support is often needed, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is frequently placed. Specific indicators for PEG placement remain unclear. This study retrospectively determined which factors contributed to enteral nutrition (EN) use and PEG placement in a large patient group to gain insight on potential indicators for PEG placement protocol creation. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 240 patients with head and neck cancer who underwent CRT in 2012\u20132015 was conducted. Lifestyle, oncological, treatment, and nutrition outcome characteristics were examined and compared between patients who used EN and those who did not, as well as between patients who received a PEG and those who did not. Results: In total, 195 patients used EN (via PEG or nasogastric tube). Multivariate analysis showed that nodal disease presence (P = .01) and bilateral neck irradiation (P = .01) were significantly related to EN use while increased age (P = .01), nodal disease presence (P = .02), reconstruction extent other than primary closure (P = .02), bilateral neck irradiation (P < .01), and an adapted intake consistency prior to treatment (P = .03) were significantly related to PEG placement. Conclusion: Important factors for EN usage and PEG placement consideration include nodal disease and planned bilateral neck irradiation. Results from this study in combination with existing literature can be taken into consideration in the design of a PEG placement protocol. A better understanding of predictive indicators to PEG placement should be explored in further prospective studies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies on the assessment of sarcopenia and its predictive and prognostic value in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Recent findings There is increasing evidence that low skeletal muscle mass (SMM), often named sarcopenia, can easily be assessed on cross-sectional imaging of the head and neck and is associated with chemotherapy (dose limiting) and radiotherapy toxicity and survival. Summary SMM measurement at the level of the third cervical vertebra (C3) on routine computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is easy and robust to perform. Several studies have shown a significantly higher incidence of cisplatin dose limiting toxicity in HNC patients with a low SMM. In HNC patients pretreatment low SMM is associated with acute and late toxicity and adverse events of radiotherapy, complications of major head and neck surgery and decreased disease-specific and overall survival. This information can be used for individualized treatment planning in HNC patients with low SMM.",

        "title": "Low dose cisplatin weekly versus high dose cisplatin every three weeks in primary chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients with low skeletal muscle mass: The CISLOW-study protocol",
        "abstract": "Chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin in a triweekly regimen of 100 mg/m2 body surface area, is used to treat locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with curative intent. Cisplatin dose limiting toxicity (CDLT) occurs often and impedes obtaining the planned cumulative cisplatin dose. A cumulative cisplatin dose of 200 mg/m2 or more is warranted for better survival and locoregional control. Patients with a low skeletal muscle mass (SMM) have a three-fold higher risk of developing CDLT than patients with a normal SMM. SMM can be assessed through measurements on routinely performed diagnostic head and neck CT- or MRI-scans. A weekly regimen of 40 mg/m2 body surface area cisplatin is proposed as a less toxic schedule, which possibly decreases the risk of developing CDLT and enables reaching a higher cumulative cisplatin dose. The aim of this multicenter randomized clinical trial (NL76533.041.21, registered in the Netherlands Trial Register) is to identify whether a regimen of weekly cisplatin increases compliance to the planned chemotherapy scheme in HNSCC patients with low SMM. The primary outcome is the difference in compliance rate, defined as absence of CDLT, between low SMM patients receiving either the weekly or triweekly regimen. Secondary outcomes consist of toxicities, the cumulative cisplatin dose, time to recurrence, incidence of recurrence at two years of follow-up, location of recurrence, 2-year overall, disease free and disease specific survival, quality of life, patient\u2019s experiences, and cost-effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) is the standard treatment for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although dosing is based on body surface area (BSA), some patients experience CDDP-related adverse events (AEs). We aimed to evaluate the impact of relative CDDP dose to skeletal muscle mass (SMM) on chemotherapy-associated AEs in patients with HNSCC undergoing CRT with high-dose CDDP. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent CRT with high-dose CDDP (80-100 mg/m2, triweekly) between 2010 and 2023. SMM was measured as the cross-sectional muscle area at the third cervical vertebra (C3-SMM) using computed tomography; the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as SMM normalized by squared height. The CDDP index was defined as the prescribed CDDP dose divided by SMI. CDDP-related AEs were assessed during the first cycle using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Results Overall, 306 patients were identified. The CDDP index cutoff value best associated with grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 AEs was 10.312. Grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 hematological toxicities exhibited stronger association with high CDDP index value than with low CDDP index value (26.9% vs 16.3%, P\u2005=\u2005.033). Multivariate analysis revealed that high CDDP index value and creatinine clearance\u2005<\u200570 mL/minute were predictive factors for grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 AEs (odds ratio [OR] 2.55, P\u2005=\u2005.008; OR 3.68, P\u2005=\u2005.002, respectively). Conclusion The CDDP index based on C3-SMM was an independent predictive factor for grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 CDDP-related AEs. C3-SMM is potentially more useful than BSA for determining the optimal CDDP dose in patients with HNSCC.",
