        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in ankylosing spondylitis including a meta-analysis of comparable trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 70 patients with established diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis and a mean disease duration of 16.7 years were investigated in two centers for 26 weeks comparing 3 g/d sulfasalazine to placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe main outcome parameters, pain score, fingers-to-floor test, and CRP, did not improve significantly in the sulfasalazine group compared to the placebo group. Altogether sulfasalazine was significantly superior to placebo only concerning the IgA levels. The dropout rate was 47% for the sulfasalazine group and 19% for the placebo group. Due to side effects, 38% and 11%, respectively, stopped treatment. Ten other prospective, double-blind, controlled studies were analyzed. Altogether 959 patients with a mean disease duration of 13.9 years were evaluated. Most parameters did not improve significantly in the sulfasalazine groups compared to the placebo groups. Spinal motility remained nearly unchanged (0.3-3.5% improvement). Pain, morning stiffness, functional index, and global assessment were slightly influenced (1.9-11.7%). Reduction of ESR, CRP, IgA, IgG, and IgM was more distinct (12.6-20.3%). In 4 studies SSZ had greater efficacy in patients with peripheral joint involvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSulfasalazine has no clinically relevant benefit in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The dropout-rate due to adverse effects is high with a daily dose of 3 g. Sulfasalazine may be beneficial in peripheral joint involvement. Only few data exist about patients with a disease duration of less than 10 years.",

        "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by back pain and progressive spinal stiffness. The prevalence of AS is 30 per 10,000 people. The patients often have complications or co-existing diseases, which may affect the choice of drugs and the treatment effects. However, the pathogenesis of AS is still controversial. Inflammation takes a key role in the occurrence and development of AS. Therefore, antiinflammation is crucial in the management of AS. The goals and principles of AS management is to achieve remission, control disease activity and improve the quality of the life of patients. What is more, drug therapy is still a primary part of AS management. Due to the heterogeneity of AS patients, the effect of conventional treatment is limited. There is evidence that multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is of great value in drug selection and reasonable combination. To conclude and reach a better understanding, we took a brief overlook of the drug treatment of AS and its related complications.",

        "title": "Age-stratified trends in the progression of spinal radiographic damage in patients with ankylosing spondylitis: a longitudinal study",
        "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate spinal radiographic progression in specific age ranges of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Methods: Longitudinal data for 1125 AS patients at a single hospital from 2000 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiographic intervals were obtained from patients with consecutive spinal radiographs. The radiographic progression rate was defined as the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) change per year within each interval. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), estimated marginal means were calculated for the mSASSS progression rate across age groups after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: We obtained 4016 radiographic intervals and stratified them into five groups based on patient age at the interval start: <20 (n\u2009=\u2009122); 20\u201329 (n\u2009=\u20091124); 30\u201339 (n\u2009=\u20091690); 40\u201349 (n\u2009=\u2009794); and \u2a7e50\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009286). The mean (SD) mSASSS progression rate for all the intervals was 0.8 (1.9). The GEE-estimated mean mSASSS progression rate increased with age, peaking in the 30\u201339 age group with a value of 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.27], and decreased slightly thereafter. In the presence of risk factors, rapid progression occurred at earlier ages: the GEE-estimated mean mSASSS progression rate in those with elevated C-reactive protein levels and preexisting syndesmophytes was 2.82 (95% CI 1.93, 3.71) in the 20\u201329 age group. Conclusion: Spinal structural damage in AS seems to progress most rapidly when patients are age 30\u201339\u2009years. An awareness of the trends in radiographic progression with advancing age could improve understanding of the natural course of AS.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper. The source paper investigates the effectiveness of cDMARDs on radiographic progression in AS, while this paper explores the age-stratified trends in the progression of spinal radiographic damage in AS patients."
