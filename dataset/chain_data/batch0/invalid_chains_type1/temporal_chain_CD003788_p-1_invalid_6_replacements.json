        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAcupuncture is commonly used by patients with chronic painful musculoskeletal disorders. There are, however, few well-designed studies of its efficacy. This paper describes a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design to evaluate acupuncture as a useful treatment adjunct in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-four patients were centrally randomized from a hospital-based rheumatology out-patient clinic. Fifty-six patients were suitable for study, all were on second-line therapy and aged 18-75 yr. There had been no change in therapy for the preceding 3 months. Patients who had previous acupuncture, anticoagulation, fear of needles or infection were excluded. Single-point (Liver 3) acupuncture or placebo was given with an intervening 6 week wash-out period. The acupuncturist, patient and statistician were blinded as far as possible. The outcome measures included the inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), visual analogue scale of pain, global patient assessment, 28 swollen and tender joint count, and a general health questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrated no significant effect of treatment or period and no significant interaction between treatment and period for any outcome variable. No adverse effects were reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcupuncture of this type cannot be considered as a useful adjunct to therapy in patients with RA. Possible reasons why this is the case are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAcupuncture has traditionally been used in China and is being increasingly applied in Western countries to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammatory disease. However, clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture have yielded inconsistent results, and the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture-produced anti-inflammation are unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) on inflammation in a rat model.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFour experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8-9 per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw of the rat. Experiment 1: To determine the effect of EA (10 and 100 Hz) versus sham treatment on inflammation. Experiment 2: To investigate the involvement of the adrenal glands on the effect of EA treatment using adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. Experiment 3: To determine the effects of EA on plasma levels of corticosterone. Experiment 4: To determine the effects of EA treatment versus immobilization on such stress indicators as heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 10 Hz EA significantly reduced CFA-induced hind paw edema. The effect was partially blocked in the ADX rats. EA significantly increased plasma levels of corticosterone but produced no noticeable signs of stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAt 10 Hz but not 100 Hz, EA suppresses inflammation by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain syndrome characterised by central sensitisation resulting in hypersentivity of the skin and deeper tissues as well as fatigue. Possibly the princess in Hans Christian Andersen's \u2018The Princess and the Pea\u2019 suffered from FMS since chronic sleep disturbances are typical in FMS. These sleep disturbances have been attributed to a dysfunction in the systems regulating sleep and wakefulness resulting in loss of deep sleep. In addition, many patients with FMS experience cognitive dysfunction, characterised by impaired concentration and short term memory consolidation, a complaint also commonly reported in other sleep disorders. In recent reviews evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in FMS it has been concluded that acupuncture has no specific effect. A prerequisite for this conclusion is that all the major symptoms in the syndrome have been assessed. However, previous studies have generally focused on the pain alleviating effect of acupuncture in FMS. We have observed that not only pain but also sleep and cognitive dysfunction may be ameliorated in response to acupuncture, suggesting that these variables should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of acupuncture in FMS. Furthermore, the results demonstrated great individual variability apart from the systematic effects related to the group, indicating that individually performed treatment strategies are required. Our suggestion is supported by experimental and clinical studies showing that acupuncture may affect in somnia and alertness, and that there may be neurophysiologic bases for these specific effects.",

        "abstract": "Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), especially p38 MAPK, plays an important role in the development of central sensitization related to persistent inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is well known to relieve persistent inflammatory pain. However, little is known about relationship between EA and p38 MAPK. Inflammatory pain rat model was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into the saline group, CFA group, and CFA + EA group. EA (constant saquare wave, 2\u2009Hz and 100\u2009Hz alternating frequencies, intensities ranging from 1 to 2\u2009mA) was applied to bilateral \u201cZusanli\u201d (ST 36) and \u201cKunlun\u201d acupoints (BL 60) for 30\u2009min, once per day. The paw edema and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured at preinjection and days postinjection 1, 3, and 14. Spinal p-p38MAPK- immunoreactivty (p-p38MAPK-IR) cells were detected by immunohistochemistry at postinjection day 3 and 14. EA significantly inhibited paw edema at postinjection days 14 and increased PWT at postinjection days 3 and 14. Moreover, the increasing number of spinal p-p38MAPK-IR cells which was induced by CFA injection was suppressed by EA stimulation. These results indicate that anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of EA might be associated with its inhibition of spinal p38 MAPK activation and thereby provide a potential mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory pain by EA.",

        "title": "Electroacupuncture Promotes the Differentiation of Transplanted Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Overexpressing TrkC into Neuron-Like Cells in Transected Spinal Cord of Rats",
        "abstract": "Our previous study indicated that electroacupuncture (EA) could increase neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels in the injured spinal cord, stimulate the differentiation of transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and improve functional recovery in the injured spinal cord of rats. However, the number of neuron-like cells derived from the MSCs is limited. It is known that NT-3 promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons by preferentially binding to its receptor TrkC. In this study, we attempted to transplant TrkC gene-modified MSCs (TrkC-MSCs) into the spinal cord with transection to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the injured spinal cord and to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance transplanted MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into neuron-like cells, resulting in increased axonal regeneration and functional improvement in the injured spinal cord. Our results showed that EA increased NT-3 levels; furthermore, it promoted neuron-phenotype differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelin formation of transplanted TrkC-MSCs. In addition, TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA (the TrkC-MSCs + EA group) treatment promoted the growth of the descending BDA-labeled corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and 5-HT-positive axonal regeneration across the lesion site into the caudal cord. In addition, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and hindlimb locomotor function increased as compared to controls (treated with the LacZ-MSCs, TrkC-MSCs, and LacZ-MSCs + EA groups). In the TrkC-MSCs + EA group, the injured spinal cord also showed upregulated expression of the proneurogenic factors laminin and GAP-43 and downregulated GFAP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major inhibitors of axonal growth. Together, our data suggest that TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment spinal cord injury not only increased MSC survival and differentiation into neuron-like cells but also promoted CST regeneration across injured sites to the caudal cord and functional improvement, perhaps due to increase of NT-3 levels, upregulation of laminin and GAP-43, and downregulation of GFAP and CSPG proteins.",

        "abstract": "Promoting remyelination is crucial for patients with demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis. However, it is still a circuitous conundrum finding a practical remyelinating therapy. Electroacupuncture (EA), originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat CNS diseases all over the world, but the role of EA in demyelinating diseases is barely known. In this study, we examined the remyelinating properties and mechanisms of EA in cuprizone-induced demyelinating model, a CNS demyelinating murine model of multiple sclerosis. By feeding C57BL/6 mice with chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks, we successfully induce demyelination as proved by weight change, beam test, pole test, histomorphology, and Western Blot. EA treatment significantly improves the neurobehavioral performance at week 7 (2 weeks after withdrawing cuprizone chow). RNA-seq and RT-PCR results reveal up-regulated expression of myelin-related genes, and the expression of myelin associated protein (MBP, CNPase, and O4) are also increased after EA treatment, indicating therapeutic effect of EA on cuprizone model. It is widely acknowledged that microglia exert phagocytic effect on degraded myelin debris and clear these detrimental debris, which is a necessary process for subsequent remyelination. We found the remyelinating effect of EA is associated with enhanced clearance of degraded myelin debris as detected by dMBP staining and red oil O staining. Our further studies suggest that more microglia assemble in demyelinating area (corpus callosum) during the process of EA treatment, and cells inside corpus callosum are mostly in a plump, ameboid, and phagocytic shape, quite different from the ramified cells outside corpus callosum. RNA-seq result also unravels that most genes relating to positive regulation of phagocytosis (GO:0050766) are up-regulated, indicating enhanced phagocytic process after EA treatment. During the process of myelin debris clearance, microglia tend to change their phenotype toward M2 phenotype. Thus, we also probed into the phenotype of microglia in our study. Immuno-staining results show increased expression of CD206 and Arg1, and the ratio of CD206/CD16/32 are also higher in EA group. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time that EA enhances myelin debris removal from activated microglia after demyelination, and promotes remyelination.",

Introduction: The small needle-scalpel is a miniature surgical instrument used to create intense and invasive punctures at certain acupoints with a small latch needle. It has been increasingly gaining popularity among clinicians and patients all over the world during the past years. However, severe complications after small needle-scalpel treatment have not previously been reported. Methods: Here we report a 54-year-old man who recently suffered from cervical spondylosis and underwent small needle-scalpel treatment, which was performed by a rural doctor. While there were no new neurologic deficits, the patient experienced delayed functional deterioration until the onset of quadriplegia within 1 month of treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a C2\u2013C7 dorsally placed extradural hematoma with severe cord compression and subcutaneous soft tissue hemorrhage. Results: The patient refused urgent corrective surgery and later died due to respiratory failure. Conclusions: Although small needle-scalpel therapy has many benefits, such as reducing pain, shorter expenditure, shorter period of therapy and better recovery of function, there are also many potentially severe risks, such as cervical extradural bleeding, which requires clinicians to pay more attention to avoid the complications.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic\u2013ischemic (H\u2010I) injury, which mainly causes neuronal damage and white matter injury (WMI), is among the predominant causes of infant morbidity (cerebral palsy, cognitive and persistent motor disabilities) and mortality. Disruptions to the oxygen and blood supply in the perinatal brain affect the cerebral microenvironment and may affect microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Microglia are significantly associated with axonal damage and myelinating oligodendrocytes, which are major pathological components of WMI. However, the effects of H\u2010I injury on microglial functions and underlying transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. The historical perception that these cells are major risk factors for ischemic stroke has been questioned due to our improved understanding of the diversity of microglial phenotypes and their alterable functions, which exacerbate or attenuate injuries in different regions in response to environmental instability. Unfortunately, although therapeutic hypothermia is an efficient treatment, death and disability remain the prognosis for a large proportion of neonates with H\u2010I injury. Hence, novel neuroprotective therapies to treat WMI following H\u2010I injury are urgently needed. Here, we review microglial mechanisms that might occur in the developing brain due to neonatal H\u2010I injury and discuss whether microglia function as a double\u2010edged sword in WMI. Then, we emphasize microglial heterogeneity, notably at the single\u2010cell level, and sex\u2010specific effects on the etiology of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss current knowledge of strategies aiming to improve microglia modulation and remyelination following neonatal H\u2010I injury.

        "abstract": "Lipid metabolism has been considered as a potential therapeutic target in sevoflurane\u2010induced neurotoxicity that can potentially affect the learning and memory function in the developmental brain. Recently, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is identified as a crucial step in regulating lipid metabolism and associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, it is reported that quercetin modified Cu2\u2010xSe (abbreviated as CSPQ) nanoparticles can ameliorate sevoflurane\u2010induced neurotoxicity by tuning the microglial lipid metabolism and promoting microglial M2\u2010like polarization via TREM2 signaling pathway, in which the apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and adenosine triphosphate\u2010binding cassette transporters (ABCA1 and ABCG1) levels are upregulated. Furthermore, the protective effects of CSPQ nanoparticles against sevoflurane\u2010induced neurotoxicity via TREM2 are further demonstrated by the small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2010TREM2 transfected BV2 cells, which are obviously not influenced by CSPQ nanoparticles. The cell membrane coated CSPQ (referred as CSPQ@CM) nanoparticles can significantly reduce sevoflurane\u2010induced learning and memory deficits, improve lipid metabolism dysfunction, and promote the remyelination in the hippocampus of mice.

This article describes the benefits provided to all of those brain cell types by GLP-1 agonist drugs. The article uses studies in humans, not rodents, to describe the effect of GLP-1 agonists upon cognition, because rodents\u2019 brains differ from those of humans in so many ways that results from rodent studies may not be totally transferable to humans. Commercially available GLP-1 agonists have mostly shown either positive effects upon cognition or no effects. One important reason for no effects is a reduced rate of entering brain parenchyma. Dulaglutide has the greatest entry to brain, at 61.8%, among the available GLP-1 agonists, and seems to offer the best likelihood for cure of AD. Although there is only one study of cognition that used dulaglutide, it was randomized, placebo controlled, and very large; it involved 8828 participants and showed significant benefit to cognition. A clinical trial to test the hypothesis that dulaglutide may cure AD should have, as its primary outcome, a 30% greater cure rate of AD by dulaglutide than that achieved by an equipoise arm of, e.g., lithium plus memantine.",
