        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The use of the new International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria (IADPSGC) for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) results in an increased prevalence of GDM. Whether their introduction improves pregnancy outcomes has yet to be established. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of one-step IADPSGC for screening and diagnosis of GDM compared with traditional two-step Carpenter-Coustan (CC) criteria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS GDM risk factors and pregnancy and newborn outcomes were prospectively assessed in 1,750 pregnant women from April 2011 to March 2012 using CC and in 1,526 pregnant women from April 2012 to March 2013 using IADPSGC between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Both groups received the same treatment and follow-up regimes. RESULTS The use of IADPSGC resulted in an important increase in GDM rate (35.5% vs. 10.6%) and an improvement in pregnancy outcomes, with a decrease in the rate of gestational hypertension (4.1 to 3.5%: \u221214.6%, P < 0.021), prematurity (6.4 to 5.7%: \u221210.9%, P < 0.039), cesarean section (25.4 to 19.7%: \u221223.9%, P < 0.002), small for gestational age (7.7 to 7.1%: \u22126.5%, P < 0.042), large for gestational age (4.6 to 3.7%: \u221220%, P < 0.004), Apgar 1-min score <7 (3.8 to 3.5%: \u22129%, P < 0.015), and admission to neonatal intensive care unit (8.2 to 6.2%: \u221224.4%, P < 0.001). Estimated cost savings was of \u20ac14,358.06 per 100 women evaluated using IADPSGC versus the group diagnosed using CC. CONCLUSIONS The application of the new IADPSGC was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in GDM prevalence in our study population, as well as significant improvements in pregnancy outcomes, and was cost-effective. Our results support their adoption.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the association of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) with neonatal birth weight (NBW) and neonatal hypoglycemia (+NH) in pregnancies complicated by diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed a retrospective cohort of 102 females, 17 with gestational diabetes (GDM), 48 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and 37 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1,5-AG and glycated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) values throughout pregnancy were extracted. Linear regression was used to assess their association with NBWs z-scores adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). +NH was defined by a note in the infant record, glucose <1.7 mmol/L in the first 24 h, or <2.5 mmol/L in the first 48 h after birth. A t test or Welch's approximate t test was used to compare the mean 1,5-AG and A1C of mothers with +NH versus those without (-NH), adjusted for gestational age and analyzed by diabetes type and across trimesters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean 1,5-AG significantly differed across groups: T1DM 3.77 \u00b1 2.82 \u03bcg/mL, T2DM 5.73 \u00b1 4.38 \u03bcg/mL, GDM 8.89 \u00b1 4.39 \u03bcg/mL (P<.0001), suggesting less glucose exposure in GDM relative to T1DM or T2DM. A negative linear association was found between mean 1,5-AG and z-scores (R= -0.28, P = .005. In contrast, the association between mean A1C and z-scores was weaker (R = 0.15, P = .14). The mean 1,5-AG tended to be lower in the +NH cohort versus -NH (P = .08), and this was statistically significant (P = .01) among subjects with GDM.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe association of 1,5-AG with complications related to glycemic exposure supports the notion of its utility as an adjunct glycemic biomarker in pregnancies complicated by diabetes and across trimesters.",

        "title": "The Relationship of Hemoglobin A1C to Time-in-Range in Patients with Diabetes.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere has been recent recognition of the limitations of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) in describing both short- and long-term glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides robust data about short-term glycemic control and provides metrics such as percent time-in-range (%TIR) that are now routinely reported to describe the change in glycemic control after an intervention in a clinical study or a change in therapy in a patient's care. Recent studies have shown that %TIR may have similar associations with diabetes microvascular complications as does HbA1C. The relationship of %TIR to the long-standing metric of overall glycemic control has not been clearly defined to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nArticles that report paired HbA1C and %TIR metrics (n\u2009=\u20091137) or HbA1C and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (n\u2009=\u20091440) across a wide range of HbA1Cs, technologies, and subject demographics were reviewed to determine the correlation of these metrics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSelected paired HbA1C and %TIR data from 18 articles were evaluated by linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. There was an excellent correlation between the two (R\u2009=\u2009-0.84; R2\u2009=\u20090.71). This relationship did not change after excluding one study that used SMBG or six studies with \u22647 days of CGM. For every absolute 10% change in %TIR, there was a 0.8% (9\u2009mmol/mol) change in HbA1C.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a good correlation between HbA1C and %TIR that may permit the transition to %TIR as the preferred metric for determining the outcome of clinical studies, predicting of the risk of diabetes complications, and assessing of an individual patient's glycemic control.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides important information to aid in achieving glycemic targets in people with diabetes. PURPOSE We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CGM with usual care for parameters of glycemic control in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES Many electronic databases were searched for articles published from inception until 30 June 2019. STUDY SELECTION We selected RCTs that assessed both changes in HbA1c and time in target range (TIR), together with time below range (TBR), time above range (TAR), and glucose variability expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted from each trial by two investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS All results were analyzed by a random effects model to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with the 95% CI. We identified 15 RCTs, lasting 12\u201336 weeks and involving 2,461 patients. Compared with the usual care (overall data), CGM was associated with modest reduction in HbA1c (WMD \u22120.17%, 95% CI \u22120.29 to \u22120.06, I2 = 96.2%), increase in TIR (WMD 70.74 min, 95% CI 46.73\u201394.76, I2 = 66.3%), and lower TAR, TBR, and CV, with heterogeneity between studies. The increase in TIR was significant and robust independently of diabetes type, method of insulin delivery, and reason for CGM use. In preplanned subgroup analyses, real-time CGM led to the higher improvement in mean HbA1c (WMD \u22120.23%, 95% CI \u22120.36 to \u22120.10, P < 0.001), TIR (WMD 83.49 min, 95% CI 52.68\u2013114.30, P < 0.001), and TAR, whereas both intermittently scanned CGM and sensor-augmented pump were associated with the greater decline in TBR. LIMITATIONS Heterogeneity was high for most of the study outcomes; all studies were sponsored by industry, had short duration, and used an open-label design. CONCLUSIONS CGM improves glycemic control by expanding TIR and decreasing TBR, TAR, and glucose variability in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

A total of 41\u202f753 participants with insulin-treated diabetes (5673 type 1; 36\u202f080 type 2) receiving care from a Northern California integrated health care delivery system (2014-2019), being treated with insulin, self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, and having no prior CGM use were included.\n\n\nExposures\nInitiation vs noninitiation of real-time CGM (reference group).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nTen end points measured during the 12 months before and 12 months after baseline: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); hypoglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); hyperglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); HbA1c levels lower than 7%, lower than 8%, and higher than 9%; 1 emergency department encounter or more for any reason; 1 hospitalization or more for any reason; and number of outpatient visits and telephone visits.\n\n\nResults\nThe real-time CGM initiators included 3806 patients (mean age, 42.4 years [SD, 19.9 years]; 51% female; 91% type 1, 9% type 2); the noninitiators included 37\u202f947 patients (mean age, 63.4 years [SD, 13.4 years]; 49% female; 6% type 1, 94% type 2). The prebaseline mean HbA1c was lower among real-time CGM initiators than among noninitiators, but real-time CGM initiators had higher prebaseline rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c declined among real-time CGM initiators from 8.17% to 7.76% and from 8.28% to 8.19% among noninitiators (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.48% to -0.32%; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

There were also statistically significant differences in the adjusted net changes in the proportion of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 7.1% to 12.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower than 8% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 13.1%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 16.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and higher than 9% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -7.1%; 95% CI, -9.5% to -4.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and in the number of outpatient visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and telephone visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Initiation of real-time CGM was not associated with statistically significant changes in rates of hyperglycemia, emergency department visits for any reason, or hospitalizations for any reason.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this retrospective cohort study, insulin-treated patients with diabetes selected by physicians for real-time continuous glucose monitoring compared with noninitiators had significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and reductions in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia, but no significant change in emergency department visits or hospitalizations for hyperglycemia or for any reason.

        "abstract": "Background: Despite documented benefits of diabetes technology in managing type 1 diabetes, inequities persist in the use of these devices. Provider bias may be a driver of inequities, but the evidence is limited. Therefore, we aimed to examine the role of race/ethnicity and insurance-mediated provider implicit bias in recommending diabetes technology. Method: We recruited 109 adult and pediatric diabetes providers across 7 U.S. endocrinology centers to complete an implicit bias assessment composed of a clinical vignette and ranking exercise. Providers were randomized to receive clinical vignettes with differing insurance and patient names as proxy for Racial\u2013Ethnic identity. Bias was identified if providers: (1) recommended more technology for patients with an English name (Racial\u2013Ethnic bias) or private insurance (insurance bias), or (2) Race/Ethnicity or insurance was ranked high (Racial\u2013Ethnic and insurance bias, respectively) in recommending diabetes technology. Provider characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. Result: Insurance-mediated implicit bias was common in our cohort (n\u2009=\u200966, 61%). Providers who were identified to have insurance-mediated bias had greater years in practice (5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 years vs. 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099 years, P\u2009=\u20090.006). Racial\u2013Ethnic-mediated implicit bias was also observed in our study (n\u2009=\u200937, 34%). Compared with those without Racial\u2013Ethnic bias, providers with Racial\u2013Ethnic bias were more likely to state that they could recognize their own implicit bias (89% vs. 61%, P\u2009=\u20090.001). Conclusion: Provider implicit bias to recommend diabetes technology was observed based on insurance and Race/Ethnicity in our pediatric and adult diabetes provider cohort. These data raise the need to address provider implicit bias in diabetes care.",
