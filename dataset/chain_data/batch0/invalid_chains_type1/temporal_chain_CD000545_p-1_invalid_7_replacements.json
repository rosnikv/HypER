Crossover data showed that improvement occurred in 26 of 39 courses of 6-MP (67%) as compared with three of 39 courses of placebo (8%) (P less than 0.001). Non-crossover data likewise confirmed the superiority of 6-MP. The drug was more effective than placebo in closing fistulas (31 vs 6%) and in permitting discontinuation or reduction of steroid dosage (75 vs. 36%) (P less than 0.001). The onset of response to 6-MP was often delayed, with 32% of patients taking longer than three months to respond, and 19% taking longer than four months. Adverse side effects to 6-MP occurred in 10% of patients and were uniformly reversible. We conclude that 6-MP is an effective and useful agent in the management of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "EXTERNAL fistulas are a characteristic of Crohn\u2018s disease, occurring in I S -20 per cent of patients ( I . 2). They usually pass through the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. I ) but they can surface in the perineum or on the buttocks. In most instances the amount of discharge of pus and faeces from the fistula is small and some patients cope with it by wearing dressings rather than a bag. Nevertheless, it is often sufficient in quantity to cause sore skin and to soil clothing. Many of these patients have already undergone operations which have failed to control or have even provoked the fistula. Others have been told that their problem is not amenable to surgical treatment. a belief still held by some physicians and an occasional surgeon. and which is just not true. Virtually all external fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease can be successfully closed as long as certain basic rules are followed. However, it has to be admitted that an occasional fistula defies closure. and in others refistulation from a different site somctimes occurs. External fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease are of two types. Type I fistulas are those that arise from a segment of bowel, often the terminal ileum, involved by active disease. The inflamed bowel becomes attached to the abdominal wall which itself becomes inflamed and the site of abscess formation. The point of attachment is often in the right iliac fossa (Fig. I ) or to the inside of a laparotomy scar, especially when this has been recently performed (Fig. 2 ) . Such fistulas form following spontaneous or induced drainage of an abscess pointing on the abdominal surface. Type 1 fistulas nearly always require operation to close them. Tipe 2 fistulas are those that follow breakdown of an anastomosis undertaken following resection of bowel involved with Crohn\u2019s disease. Most fistulas of this type. given correct treatment, will heal spontaneously. In this respect their management differs fundamentally from type 1 fistulas.",

        "abstract": "Fifty\u2010two patients with Crohn's disease have been assessed using acute phase proteins and a scoring system. Thirty\u2010nine underwent operation and intra\u2010abdominal abscesses were found in seventeen. Both scores and acute phase proteins have been shown to reflect inflammation due to secondary sepsis in addition to that from active Crohn's disease. The scores were higher, and acute phase changes greater, in patients with sepsis than those without. By choosing a threshold for each variable that excludes patients without sepsis it has been found that a score > 181, ESR >45 mm/h, CRP >33 mg/l, orosomucoid >1.8g/l and albumin < 26.7 g/l identify sepsis with a specificity >95 per cent and sensitivity > 35 per cent. Over 70 per cent of patients with abscesses exceeded one or more of these thresholds. We believe that operative management should be strongly considered if one or more of these criteria are positive as such patients have a greater than 90 per cent chance of having an intra\u2010abdominal abscess. This will prevent these abscesses eroding into adjacent viscera or to the surface with resulting fistula formation.",

The serum concentrations of serum amyloid A protein (SAA), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1\u2010antichymotrypsin (alpha 1\u2010ACT) and alpha 1\u2010acid glycoprotein (alpha 1\u2010AGP) have been measured in eighty\u2010six patients with Crohn's disease, twenty\u2010five patients with ulcerative colitis and twenty\u2010two patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. In the Crohn's and ulcerative colitis group significant increases in concentration were observed in all four proteins, which parallelled disease severity as defined by other conventional laboratory parameters formulated into a simple activity index. In the irritable bowel group no significant changes were seen. Serum amyloid A and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease when mild, but did not differ significantly when severe. Serum amyloid A correlated well with CRP (r= 0\u00b783) and alpha 1\u2010ACT (r= 0\u00b780), but less well with alpha 1\u2010AGP (r= 0\u00b765). Serum amyloid A was the most sensitive protein (77%) but had the lowest specificity (74%). C\u2010reactive protein was less sensitive (58%) than SAA but had greater specificity (100%). Alpha 1\u2010ACT had a sensitivity and specificity similar to CRP and, therefore, provided little or no additional information. Alpha 1\u2010AGP, although also 100% specific, had the lowest sensitivity (34%) and, therefore, is probably the least useful acute phase monitor of inflammatory bowel disease. The role, and associated problems, of SAA measurements are discussed.",

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 of these patients to generate soluble interleukin-2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations of patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 19) were significantly elevated (757 +/- 438 U/ml) compared with levels in patients with inactive disease (n = 10; 412 +/- 120 U/ml) and healthy control individuals (n = 40; 375 +/- 102 U/ml; p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). Serial determinations of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration in a follow-up of 11 hospitalized patients treated for highly active disease showed a decrease from 1252 +/- 494 U/ml to 527 +/- 193 U/ml (p less than 0.004) that corresponded to clinical improvement, as assessed by Crohn's disease activity index and a reduction of inflammatory parameters. In vitro phytohemagglutinin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn's disease resulted in elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor production not only in patients with active disease (3987 +/- 2439 U/ml), but also in patients with inactive disease (3297 +/- 2282 U/ml), compared with the amount of soluble interleukin-2 receptor produced by mononuclear cells of healthy individuals (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, cultivation of mononuclear cells without mitogen resulted in higher soluble interleukin-2 receptor production in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.02). However, patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis also had significantly increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (1080 +/- 400 U/ml) compared with the levels in patients with chronic disease (455 +/- 140 U/ml; p less than 0.0025). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with ulcerative colitis produced significantly more soluble interleukin-2 receptor upon mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (2314 +/- 936 U/ml), than cells from healthy controls (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.05). The finding of elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels in patients with active Crohn's disease and its increased production by mononuclear cells of patients with both active and inactive disease is a further example of an alteration of the immune system in this condition; however, this alteration can also be found in other inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "abstract": "Human intestinal lamina propria T lymphocytes (LPL\u2010T) physiologically exhibit minimal proliferation in response to antigen receptor stimulation in vitro. This is thought to occur as a consequence of regulatory influences which are exerted by the mucosal microenvironment. The present study is aimed at investigating whether proliferative responses of intestinal LPL\u2010T to antigen receptor stimulation are altered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, proliferative responses of LPL\u2010T in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis to stimulation with CD3 MoAb plus IL\u20102 were examined and compared with controls. In addition, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of LPL\u2010T and peripheral blood T lymphocytes were determined by indirect immunofluorescenee using a panel of 11 TCR V\u03b2 specific antibodies. In most patients with inflammatory bowel disease, LPL\u2010T showed enhanced proliferation to antigen receptor stimulation compared with controls. Moreover, perhaps as a consequence, an enhanced frequency of in vivo preactivated T cells was seen as judged from an increased spontaneous proliferative response to low concentrations of exogenous IL\u20102. LPL\u2010T and peripheral blood T lymphocytes exhibited similar percentages of TCR V\u03b2 gene usage both in controls and in patients. In summary, polyclonal activation of LPL\u2010T due to impairment of local adjustment, i.e. insufficient down\u2010regulation of TCR/CD3\u2010dependent signalling processes, may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral lung tissue contains large numbers of T cells, strategically located for immune surveillance at the blood\u2013air interface. Given the intensity of antigenic exposure at this site, it is clear that local T\u2010cell activation events require strict control, in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. How this control is achieved in this unique tissue microenvironment is unknown, and the present study sought to elucidate the process via detailed analysis of the surface phenotypic characteristics of freshly isolated lung T cells. We report below that these cells display typical characteristic of \u2018postactivation\u2019, notably elevated basal Ca2+ concentrations, down\u2010modulated T\u2010cell receptors, expression of Ia and \u2018late\u2019 activation antigens and concomitant CD4/CD8.

        "abstract": "Summary: Experimental data indicate that mucosal CD4+ T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Based on the pattern of cytokine production, CD4+ T cells may be distinguished into two different phenotypes. Th1 responses are characterized by secretion of interleukin (IL)\u20102, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr;, lymphotoxin, and interferon (IFN)\u2010&ggr; and are associated with delayedtype hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Th2 responses, which are characterized by secretion of IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010, have been associated with humoral immune responses and allergy. To assess the number of IFN\u2010&agr; and IL\u20104 positive cells in IBD and normal intestinal specimens, frozen sections from intestinal specimens from 10 Crohn's disease (CD), 8 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 healthy controls were examined by immunohistochemistry. Monoclonal antibodies for CD3, CD8, IFN\u2010&ggr;, and IL\u20104 were used. T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration and cytokine expression by epithelial, lamina propria, and submucosal cells were scored on a four\u2010point scale by two independent observers who were blinded for the clinical data. One\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was used for statistical analysis. In intestinal specimens from IBD patients, the number of CD3+ cells was found increased in the lamina propria and, within the submucosa, this increase was significant (p < 0.001). In CD the number of lamina propria IFN\u2010&ggr; positive cells was significantly increased as compared with controls (p < 0.002). In UC the number of both IFN\u2010&ggr; and IL\u20104 producing cells in the lamina propria was not significantly increased as compared with controls.

However, the factors regulating crypt cell growth in pathological conditionsare not fully understood. We report here that the endogenously produced chemokine CXCL10 regulates crypt cell proliferation. CXCL10 was constitutively expressed by basal crypts in mouse colon, but the expression of CXCL10 as well as CXCR3 was enhanced in the epithelium in the proliferative zone after oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium. Neutralization of CXCL10 protected mice from epithelial ulceration by promoting crypt cell survival without evidence of altered immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, recombinant CXCL10 administration into mice inhibited intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. These findings suggest that CXCL10 regulates crypt cell growth to maintain intestinal homeostasis in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Thus, CXCL10 can be a new therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease by controlling the dynamics of epithelial homeostasis.",

Here we demonstrate that plasmacytoid DC (pDC) precursors can transmigrate across high endothelial venules (HEVs) of inflamed LNs in mice. Bacterial infection induces a significant number of pDC and myeloid DC (mDC) precursors into the circulation. Both subsets express a common set of chemokine receptors except CXCR3, display parallel mobilization into the blood, but show distinct trafficking pathway to the LNs. In a short-term homing assay, whereas mDC precursors migrate to peripheral tissues and subsequently to draining LNs, pDC precursors directly enter the LNs in a CXCL9 and E-selectin dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha controls not only DC precursor mobilization into the blood but also chemokine up-regulation on LN HEVs. A similar trafficking pathway is observed also in viral infection, and CXCR3(-/-) mice-derived pDC precursors show defective trans-HEV migration.

        "abstract": "Antiviral cell\u2013mediated immunity is initiated by the dendritic cell (DC) network in lymph nodes (LNs). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are known to migrate to inflamed LNs and produce interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, but their other roles in antiviral T cell immunity are unclear. We report that LN-recruited pDCs are activated to create local immune fields that generate antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in association with LNDCs, in a model of cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Although pDCs alone failed to induce CTLs, in vivo depletion of pDCs impaired CTL-mediated virus eradication. LNDCs from pDC-depleted mice showed impaired cluster formation with T cells and antigen presentation to prime CTLs. Transferring circulating pDC precursors from wild-type, but not CXCR3-deficient, mice to pDC-depleted mice restored CTL induction by impaired LNDCs. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that pDCs provided help signals that recovered impaired LNDCs in a CD2- and CD40L-dependent manner. pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 further stimulated the recovered LNDCs to induce CTLs. Therefore, the help provided by pDCs for LNDCs in primary immune responses seems to be pivotal to optimally inducing anti-HSV CTLs.",

DCs serve as critical links between the innate and adaptive immune responses against many pathogens, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The role of DCs as mediators of resistance to HSV-1 infection was investigated using CD11c-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, in which DCs can be transiently depleted in vivo by treatment with low doses of DT. We show that ablation of DCs led to enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the highly resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. Specifically, we showed that the depletion of DCs led to increased viral spread into the nervous system, resulting in an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we showed that ablation of DCs impaired the optimal activation of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to HSV-1. These data demonstrated that DCs were essential not only in the optimal activation of the acquired T-cell response to HSV-1 but also that DCs were crucial for innate resistance to HSV-1 infection.",

        "title": "Energy restriction impairs natural killer cell function and increases the severity of influenza infection in young adult male C57BL/6 mice.",
        "abstract": "Energy restriction (ER) without malnutrition extends lifespan in mice and postpones age-related changes in immunity. However, we have previously shown that aged (22 mo old) ER mice exhibit increased mortality, impaired viral clearance, and reduced natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity following influenza infection compared with aged mice that consumed food ad libitum (AL). To determine whether the detrimental effects of ER in response to influenza infection occur independently of advanced age, young adult (6 mo) male C57BL/6 mice consuming an AL or ER diet were infected with influenza A virus (H1N1, PR8). Young adult ER mice exhibited increased mortality (P < 0.05) and weight loss (P < 0.01) in response to infection. ER mice exhibited decreased total (P < 0.001) and NK1.1+ lymphocytes (P < 0.05) in lung and reduced influenza-induced NK cell cytotoxicity in both lung (P < 0.01) and spleen (P < 0.05). Importantly, the mRNA expression of interferon (IFN)alpha/beta (P < 0.05) was also reduced in the lungs of ER mice in response to infection, and in vitro stimulation of NK cells from ER mice with type I IFN resulted in cytotoxicity comparable to that in NK cells from AL mice. In contrast, NK cell activation was enhanced in ER mice, determined as an increase in the percentage of NK cells expressing B220 (P < 0.001) and increased intracellular production of IFNgamma (P < 0.01). These data describe an age-independent and detrimental effect of ER on the innate immune response to influenza infection and suggest that a decrease in NK cell number and alterations in the NK cell-activating environment may contribute to decreased innate immunity in ER mice.",

        "title": "CXCR3 Deficiency Increases Susceptibility to Genital Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Infection: Uncoupling of CD8+ T-Cell Effector Function but Not Migration",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT CXCR3 is a G-protein-coupled receptor preferentially expressed by activated T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Signaling through gamma interferon-regulated chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCR3 plays a critical role in the immune response of many viral pathogens. However, the relevance of CXCR3 for optimal T-cell activation and the induction of regulatory transcription factors (i.e., T-bet and eomesodermin) relative to host immune defense against genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection have been poorly defined. In this study, we evaluated the requirement of CXCR3 expression during genital HSV-2 infection using mice deficient in CXCR3 (CXCR3\u2212/\u2212) along with wild-type (WT) controls, assessing the resistance of mice to viral infection and focusing on the cytokine/chemokine response, phenotypic analysis of recruited leukocytes, and functional analysis of CD8+ T cells. CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a heightened sensitivity to infection compared to WT animals in terms of the viral burden in infected tissues as well as elevated mortality. The poor response of CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice to viral infection was associated with reduced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity through the impairment of T-bet, perforin, and granzyme B expression by CD8+ T cells. Corresponding with the defective cytolytic activity, a reduction in recruitment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CD80 expression in CD11c+ dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice were detected. Collectively, the results provide a new perspective to CXCR3 signaling for the appropriate activation of CD8+ T cells required for host defense against genital HSV-2 infection.",

        "abstract": "Alveolar Type II (ATII) cells are important targets for seasonal and pandemic influenza. To investigate the influenza-induced innate immune response in those cells, we measured the global gene expression profile of highly differentiated ATII cells infected with the influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 at 4 hours and 24 hours after inoculation. Infection with influenza stimulated a significant increase in the mRNA concentrations of many host defense-related genes, including pattern/pathogen recognition receptors, IFN, and IFN-induced genes, chemokines, and suppressors of cytokine signaling. We verified these changes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At the protein level, we detected a robust virus-induced secretion of the three glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR)-negative chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, according to ELISA. The ultraviolet inactivation of virus abolished the chemokine and cytokine response. Viral infection did not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, as measured by cellular mRNA and concentrations of surfactant proteins. However, viral infection significantly reduced the secretion of surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D. In addition, influenza A virus triggered a time-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in ATII cells. The inhibition of this pathway significantly decreased the release of infectious virus and the chemokine response, but did not alter virus-induced cell death. This study provides insights into influenza-induced innate immunity in differentiated human ATII cells, and demonstrates that the alveolar epithelium is a critical part of the initial innate immune response to influenza.",

Tissue-specificity imprinting starts during priming by tissue-derived migratory dendritic cells in the non-random, specialized micro-anatomical area of the draining lymph node and is influenced by constitutive and induced cues from local environment. Besides tissue-specific effectors, memory cells also exhibit a tissue-specificity. Long-lived tissue-resident memory T cells likely play a considerable role in preventing pathogen invasion. Understanding of the mechanisms of tissue specialization of T cells is of major importance for the design of optimal vaccination strategies and therapeutic interventions in tissue/organ-specific inflammatory diseases.

        "title": "CXCL10 Triggers Early Microglial Activation in the Cuprizone Model",
        "abstract": "A broad spectrum of diseases is characterized by myelin abnormalities and/or oligodendrocyte pathology. In most, if not all, of these diseases, early activation of microglia occurs. Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering early microglia activation is, however, incomplete. In this study, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the temporal and causal relationship of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and early microglia activation. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed the induction of distinct chemokines, among them Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Early microglia activation was unchanged in CCL2- and CCL3-deficient knockouts, but was significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice, resulting in an amelioration of cuprizone toxicity at later time points. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that recombinant CXCL10 induced migration and a proinflammatory phenotype in cultured microglia, without affecting their phagocytic activity or proliferation. In situ hybridization analyses suggest that Cxcl10 mRNA is mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also oligodendrocytes, in short-term cuprizone-exposed mice. Our results show that CXCL10 actively participates in the initiation of microglial activation. These findings have implications for the role of CXCL10 as an important mediator during the initiation of neuroinflammatory processes associated with oligodendrocyte pathology.",

        "abstract": "Development of social cognition, a unique and high-order function, depends on brain maturation from childhood to adulthood in humans. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia have similar social cognitive deficits, although age of onset in each disorder is different. Pathogenesis of these disorders is complex and contains several features, including genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors, and sites of abnormalities in the brain. Although several hypotheses have been postulated, they seem to be insufficient to explain how brain alterations associated with symptoms in these disorders develop at distinct developmental stages. Development of ASD appears to be related to cerebellar dysfunction and subsequent thalamic hyperactivation in early childhood. By contrast, schizophrenia seems to be triggered by thalamic hyperactivation in late adolescence, whereas hippocampal aberration has been possibly initiated in childhood. One of the possible culprits is metal homeostasis disturbances that can induce dysfunction of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Thalamic hyperactivation is thought to be induced by microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and abnormalities of intracerebral environment. Consequently, it is likely that the thalamic hyperactivation triggers dysregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for lower brain regions related to social cognition. In this review, we summarize the brain aberration in ASD and schizophrenia and provide a possible mechanism underlying social cognitive deficits in these disorders based on their distinct ages of onset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus low-intensity continuous training (LICT) on transcriptional levels of neurotrophic factors and oligodendrocyte/microglia cell loss in a cuprizone (CP) induced animal model of demyelination. Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to six groups: control (C), cuprizone-induced demyelination (CP), interval training (IT), continuous training (CT), IT plus CP (ITCP), and CT plus CP (CTCP). Training programs on the treadmill were performed for four weeks, and then demyelination was induced by feeding mice a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for five weeks. Animals that received cuprizone showed poorer motor function, lower expression of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, and fewer oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus compared to the control animals. The numbers of oligodendrocyte and microglia cells increased in the ITCP group compared to the CTCP group (P<0.05). Both training programs increased the mRNA levels of BDNF, GDNF and NGF, and the HIIT program was more effective than the LICT program (P<0.05). Both exercise programs prevented the abnormal neurological movements induced by cuprizone. Our results indicated that HIIT versus LICT had a greater neuroprotective effect against multiple sclerosis by improving gene expression for abnormal neurotrophins and cellular loss in the hippocampus.",
