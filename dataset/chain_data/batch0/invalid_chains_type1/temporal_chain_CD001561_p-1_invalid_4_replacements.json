        "abstract": "Aim: To examine the worksite physical activity intervention literature and discuss whether the findings are applicable to New Zealand worksite environments. Data sources: Information was sourced from major health databases using key words physical activity, intervention, worksite, workplace, and health promotion. The remainder of the literature search was directed from citations in the articles sourced from the original search. Study selection: Studies included in the review were related to worksite physical activity programmes and/or interventions. Programmes that incorporated screening and other risk behaviour management (for example smoking or stress management) but no health-related physical activity were excluded. Data extraction: The literature was systematically reviewed to evaluate the utility of worksite physical activity programmes for health in general and more specifically for their utility in application to New Zealand worksites. Effect size calculations were generated to quantify major studies. Symphysis: Despite convincing potential, data show little conclusive evidence that worksite interventions do increase long-term adherence to physical activity, provide health benefits, reduce absenteeism, or improve productivity. Problems include contamination through self-selection, high attrition rates, and poor outcome measures. A scarcity of New Zealand worksite physical activity research currently exists with no published accounts of evidence-based programmes identified. Conclusions: A comprehensive appraisal of worksite physical activity literature highlights the complexity of carrying out worksite physical activity interventions and drawing dose-response conclusions. Quality New Zealand research is needed to understand the specifics of the New Zealand workplace and how activity programmes might affect worker behaviour.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the dose\u2013response relation between moderate and vigorous physical activity and sick leave in a working population. Methods: Data were used from three large Dutch databases: two continuous, cross sectional surveys among a representative sample of the Dutch population and one prospective cohort study. A distinction was made between duration, frequency and intensity of physical activity. The outcome measure was the number of days of sick leave. Analyses of variance were used to compare sick leave (in days) for workers with different amounts of physical activity, in particular workers meeting the physical activity recommendations v those who did not. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to obtain effect estimates in the prospective cohort study, with the generalised estimating equation (GEE) method. Results: No relation was found between moderate physical activity and sick leave. In two databases, workers meeting the recommendation of vigorous physical activity (active at a vigorous level for at least three times a week) had significantly less sick leave: more than one day over two months and more than four days over a year. The duration of vigorous physical activity was not associated with sick leave. Conclusion: Physical activity at a vigorous intensity level for at least three times a week, as in the CDC/ACSM recommendation, has a positive effect on sick leave.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn modern society, decreased physical activity and/or changes in quality and quantity of nutritional intake contribute to obesity and lifestyle diseases that result in economic costs, both to society and to individuals.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo measure physical fitness and body mass index (BMI) and to assess their association with sickness absence in male soldiers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData regarding BMI and physical fitness (aerobic endurance and muscle fitness) were collected for male Finnish military personnel and combined with sickness absence data collected in the year 2004. The duration and costs of sickness absence were obtained from the personnel administration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7179 male military personnel (mean age 37, range 18-59; mean BMI 26.0, range 17-50) participated. There were large inter-individual variations in physical fitness and body mass. The group with the longest sickness absences (>7 days) exhibited lower muscle fitness in three of four tests and shorter running distance compared to the groups with shorter sickness absence (P < 0.001). In addition, high BMI, poor muscle fitness and poor aerobic endurance were associated with increased sickness absence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present results showed that poor muscle fitness and endurance as well as high BMI are risk factors for productivity loss causing additional costs for the employer. Therefore, workers at a greater risk should be offered more multifaceted information about potential health risks, as well as motivational support to improve their lifestyle.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine whether the volume and intensity of physical activity are associated with subsequent sickness absence spells of different lengths, and how much of these associations can be explained by socioeconomic position, body mass index (BMI) and physical health functioning. Baseline data were collected by questionnaire surveys in 2000\u20132002 among 40\u201360\u2010year\u2010old employees of Helsinki City (n=6465, 79% women). Sickness absence data were derived from the employer's registers (mean follow\u2010up time 3.9 years). Associations of physical activity with shorter (\u226414 days) and longer (>14 days) sickness absence spells were examined, using Poisson's regression analysis. The volume of physical activity was weakly and somewhat inconsistently associated with sickness absence. However, men and women who were vigorously active systematically had reduced risk of sickness absence, whereas the same volume of moderately intensive physical activity did not reduce the risk of sickness absence. Adjusting for BMI and in particular physical health functioning attenuated these associations, after which the associations lost statistical significance. The results suggest that vigorous physical activity is associated with sickness absence and may contribute to better work ability.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the associations of sleep duration with subsequent weight and major weight gain in women and men during a follow\u2010up period of 5\u20137\u2003years. The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort mail questionnaire surveys among 40\u201360\u2010year\u2010old employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland. At baseline in 2000\u20132002, 8960 people responded to the survey (80% women, response rate 67%). The follow\u2010up survey was conducted in 2007 among all respondents to the baseline survey (n\u2003=\u20037332, response rate 83%). Sleep duration (5\u2003h or less up to 10\u2003h or more) and weight and weight gain of at least 5\u2003kg were based on self\u2010reports. Analyses of variance and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between sleep duration and weight, as well as major weight gain. Short sleep duration was associated with major weight gain [odds ratio (OR) 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 2.14] during the follow\u2010up. Adjusting for several covariates had only minor effects on that association. Long sleep duration was associated with major weight gain after adjusting for age (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.00\u20131.81). No associations were found among men. Sleep duration was associated with major weight gain among middle\u2010aged employed women. Short sleep may be a risk factor for subsequent weight gain.",

        "title": "Physical Activity and Risk of Hypertension: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies",
        "abstract": "Published literature reports controversial results about the association of physical activity (PA) with risk of hypertension. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed to investigate the effect of PA on hypertension risk. PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify all related prospective cohort studies. The Q test and I2 statistic were used to examine between-study heterogeneity. Fixed or random effects models were selected based on study heterogeneity. A funnel plot and modified Egger linear regression test were used to estimate publication bias. Thirteen prospective cohort studies were identified, including 136 846 persons who were initially free of hypertension, and 15 607 persons developed hypertension during follow-up. The pooled relative risk (RR) of main results from these studies suggests that both high and moderate levels of recreational PA were associated with decreased risk of hypertension (high versus low: RR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76\u20130.85 and moderate versus low: RR, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.85\u20130.94). The association of high or moderate occupational PA with decreased hypertension risk was not significant (high versus low: RR, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.81\u20131.08 and moderate versus low: RR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.87\u20131.06). No publication bias was observed. The results of this meta-analysis suggested that there was an inverse dose\u2013response association between levels of recreational PA and risk of hypertension, whereas there was no significant association between occupational PA and hypertension.",

        "title": "Leisure time physical activity and cancer risk: evaluation of the WHO's recommendation based on 126 high-quality epidemiological studies",
        "abstract": "Background The WHO has concluded that physical activity reduces the risk of numerous diseases. However, few systemic reviews have been performed to assess the role of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in lowering the risk of cancer in a dose-dependent manner and furthermore the suitability of recommendation of physical activity by the WHO. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to estimate cancer risk by LTPA in binary comparison and in a dose-dependent manner. MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched up to 30 December 2014 without language restrictions. Reference lists were reviewed for potential articles. Results A total of 126 studies were recruited into the meta-analysis. Overall, the total cancer risk was reduced by 10% in people who undertook the most LTPA as compared with those who did the least. Dose\u2013response meta-analysis indicated that the current WHO recommendation (equal to an average of 10 metabolic equivalents of energy hours per week) induced a 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) cancer reduction. Moreover, the protective role of LTPA against cancer becomes saturated at 20 metabolic equivalents of energy hours per week, with a relative risk of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.93). Subanalyses results based on cancer types showed that LTPA only exhibited significant protection against breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Conclusions Our meta-analysis indicates that the current WHO recommendation of physical activity can result in a 7% reduction in cancer risk, which is mainly attributed to its protective role against breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Furthermore, two-fold of current recommendation level is considered to give its saturated protection against cancer.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Nowadays, international organisations such as WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA support a holistic approach towards an individual, aimed at solving life problems, which is missing from educational prevention programmes. At first, the level of knowledge in the individuals should be defined in order to adjust the information concerning an ailment to educational needs. The overall and neurological state of the individual affected by stroke very frequently does not allow to convey much knowledge. Knowledge on stroke results in decreased incidence, which explains the necessity to raise awareness of risk factors for stroke.\n\nThe aim: The aim of the research was to establish a connection between the level of knowledge of the ailment in people affected by stroke and their quality of life.\n\nMaterial and methods: The research included 279 people after stroke. Their quality of life was assessed using a shortened version of the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire. In order to assess the level of knowledge of health-supporting actions after stroke, an indicator of knowledge was created.\n\nResults: The strongest dependence in the somatic (DOM1), social (DOM3) and environmental fields (DOM4) was observed in the group of people between 13 and 24 months after falling ill. The strongest dependence in the psychological field (DOM2) was observed in the group of people between 6 and 12 months after the incident.\n\nConclusion: The level of health-supporting knowledge in people affected by stroke is not satisfactory. A higher level of knowledge results in a higher quality of life.\n\n",
