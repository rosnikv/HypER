        "title": "Efficacy of Biologicals in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis",
        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem disease. A characteristic feature of RA is persistent inflammatory synovitis, usually involving the peripheral joints in a symmetric distribution. The prevalence of RA is approximately 0.8% of the population (range: 0.3\u20132.1%); women are affected approximately 3 times more often than men. The current therapeutic approach is to start a disease-modifying agent early in the illness to prevent eventual joint damage. Older disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs include methotrexate, sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Newer ones such as leflunomide and cyclosporin are also used. A recent advance in the management of rheumatoid arthritis is the use of biological agents, which block certain key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of the illness. They include tumour-necrosis-factor-\u03b1-blocking agents such as infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab, the anti-CD-20 agent, rituximab, and CTLA-4 Ig abatacept. The present study was planned with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of such newer biological therapies in refractory RA at various time points. Databases including Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched for all relevant studies up to January 2007. A total of 26 studies were included in present meta-analysis. The method of DerSimonian and Laird [Control Clin Trials 1986;7:177\u2013188] was used to calculated a pooled odds ratio (OR) for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria 20, 50 and 70, at 24, 54 and 96 weeks. The overall pooled OR were found to be significantly more than the placebo at all 3 time points for all 3 criteria (ACR 20, 50 70). In conclusion, biologicals as a group are highly effective in the treatment of RA. Biologicals were efficacious both in treatment na\u00efve and methotrexate-refractory patients.",

        "title": "How tumour necrosis factor blockers interfere with tuberculosis immunity",
        "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immunity to numerous bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept are anti\u2010TNF agents used to treat a range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The use of some of these drugs has been linked to reactivation TB. In addition to blocking TNF\u2010mediated immune responses, some anti\u2010TNF drugs have been found to interfere with innate immune responses, such as phagolysosomal maturation and monocyte apoptosis, as well as cell\u2010mediated responses, including interferon\u2010\u03b3 secretion by memory T cells, complement\u2010mediated lysis of Mtb\u2010reactive CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cell activity. This review summarizes some of the reported effects of TNF blockers on immune cell responses in the context of the observed clinical data on TB reactivation in patients on anti\u2010TNF therapy.",

        "title": "Incidence of Tuberculosis Among Korean Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis Who Are Taking Tumor Necrosis Factor Blockers",
        "abstract": "Objective. To assess the incidence and relative risk of new tuberculosis (TB) infections in Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and patients with AS who are undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Methods. New cases of TB were identified by reviewing the medical records of 919 patients with AS not treated with TNF blockers and those of 354 patients with AS treated with adalimumab (n = 66), infliximab (n = 78), or etanercept (n = 210) between 2002 and 2009. Reference data were obtained from the Korean National Tuberculosis Association. Results. The mean incidence rate of TB was 69.8 per 100,000 person-years (PY) in the general population, 308 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, and 561 per 100,000 PY in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort. The incidence rate of TB in the infliximab-treated AS cohort (540 per 100,000 PY) was higher than that in the adalimumab-treated AS cohort (490 per 100,000 PY). No cases of TB occurred in the etanercept-treated AS cohort. Comparing the relative risks of TB infections between the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort and the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort, no statistically significant difference was identified (risk ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.144\u20131.913). Conclusion. The risk of TB was higher in the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort than it was in the general population. However, the risk of TB was not increased in the TNF blocker-exposed AS cohort compared with the TNF blocker-naive AS cohort. Among patients with AS, etanercept is associated with a lower risk of TB compared with monoclonal antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Background Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The objective of the present study was to determine the rate of active TB infection in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and to determine the results of their latent TB infection (LTBI) screening tests during the follow up. Methods This is a retrospective observational study of IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. Tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA), and chest radiography were used to determine LTBI. Active TB infection rate during anti-TNF treatment was determined. Results Seventy-six IBD patients (25 with ulcerative colitis, 51 with Crohn\u2019s disease; 53 male; mean age 42.0\u00b112.4 years) were included. Forty-four (57.9%) patients received infliximab and 32 (42.1%) adalimumab. Their median duration of anti-TNF therapy was 15 months. Forty-five (59.2%) patients had LTBI and received isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis. During the follow-up period, active TB was identified in 3 (4.7%) patients who were not receiving INH prophylaxis. There was a moderate concordance between the TST and the IGRA (kappa coefficient 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.76). Patients with or without immunosuppressive therapy did not differ significantly with respect to TST (P=0.318) and IGRA (P=0.157). Conclusion IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and prophylactic INH have a decreased risk of developing active TB infection. However, despite LTBI screening, the risk of developing active TB infection persists.",
