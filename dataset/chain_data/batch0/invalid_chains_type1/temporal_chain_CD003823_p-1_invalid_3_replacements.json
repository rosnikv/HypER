        "abstract": "The primary goal of combination therapy is to enhance efficacy without compromising safety. In this multicenter study, the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril added to continuing hydrochlorothiazide therapy were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate (stage I and II), essential hypertension. Two hundred fifty\u2010two patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg were treated for 4 weeks with open\u2010label hydrochlorothiazide at 25 mg/day. The 208 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was \u226590 mmHg at the end of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy entered a 12\u2010week, double\u2010blind treatment, where placebo or perindopril were added to the 25\u2010mg/day hydrochlorothiazide therapy as follows: placebo (n = 50) and doses of perindopril at 2 mg/day (n = 52), 4 mg/day (n = 53), and 8 mg/day (n = 53). The perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations decreased both supine systolic blood pressure and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, for perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/day, respectively; there was no difference among the three drug groups. Placebo decreased blood pressure by 1.6/2.0 mmHg, an effect that was significantly lower compared with perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations. Adverse events were mild and similar among all treatment groups, except cough, which was 4.0%, 3.9%, 7.6%, and 13.2% for placebo and perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. The results of this multicenter study indicate that the combination of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide is safe and effective in lowering blood pressure. The findings also demonstrate that lower doses of perindopril are as effective as higher doses when combined with hydrochlorothiazide.",

Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and other angiotensin receptor blocker combinations with a diuretic have been shown to be effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in a diverse patient population previously uncontrolled on monotherapy. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was performed on the intent\u2010to\u2010treat population of the INCLUSIVE study to identify variables predictive of variations in blood pressure changes in response to irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy. Higher baseline systolic blood pressure, female sex, type 2 diabetes, and statin therapy were found to be predictive of additional blood pressure lowering with this combination. The impact of higher baseline systolic blood pressure and diabetic state on changes in systolic blood pressure were diminished in female patients compared with male patients.

We compared efficacy and safety of early versus late titration after 10 weeks\u2019 treatment with irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide. Hypertensive patients uncontrolled on monotherapy were randomized into two groups. In the early titration group (E), patients received irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150/12.5 mg for 2 weeks; uncontrolled patients were up-titrated to 300/25 mg at weeks 2 and 6.

The present study was conducted to examine the association of dietary salt intake with the changes in srNa levels when angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment is changed to the combination of ARB plus a low-dose diuretic, Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).\n\nMethods: In 88 patients (age 70\u00b112 years old), ARB treatment was switched to the combination drug (the same dosage ARB plus 12.5 mg/day HCTZ). srNa level was measured before and 6 months after administration of this combination drug. The daily salt intake was estimated by the Kawasaki formula using second morning urine.\n\nResults: The study subjects were divided into quintile ranges according to the daily salt intake. The reduction in srNa levels by switching to the ARB plus HCTZ treatment was significant in subjects in the lowest quintile Q5 (7.22 g/day or less salt intake), but not in those in Q1-4 (17.78-7.25 g/day salt intake). Increases in serum creatinine and uric acid levels, however, were significantly larger in the former group than in the latter group.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\n\nConclusions: In the strict low salt intake condition (< 7.2 g/day), the addition of a low-dose diuretic (12.5 mg HCTZ) to ARB treatment causes significant reductions in srNa levels, which might affect blood osmolarity.\n\n [1]: pending:yes",

The aim of this study was to investigate possible predictors of thiazide-induced hyponatremia.A total of 48 patients admitted to the ward or to the emergency department due to severe thiazide-induced hyponatremia (Na\u200a<\u200a125\u200ammol/L) were enrolled in our study as the case group. Another 211 hypertensive patients with normal sodium levels after treatment with thiazide diuretics were selected as the control group. Twelve tag single nucleotide polymorphism markers were selected from the Potassium Channel, Inwardly Rectifying Subfamily J, Member 1 (KCNJ1) gene: rs1231254, rs2238009, rs1148058, rs675482, rs673614, rs12795437, rs2855800, rs2509585, rs3016774, rs881333, rs4529890, and rs7116606. Clinical and genetic parameters between patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia and the control group were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze data.The patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia were older (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), predominantly female (P\u200a=\u200a0.008), had a lower mean body mass index (BMI) (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and more commonly used angiotensin II receptor antagonist (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and spironolactone (P\u200a=\u200a0.007) compared with the control groups.

        "abstract": "Carbamazepine (CBZ, Tegretol\u00ae) is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain; however, several unwanted effects of this drug have been noticed. Therefore, the regulatory actions of CBZ on ionic currents in electrically excitable cells need to be reappraised, although its efficacy in suppressing voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) has been disclosed. This study was undertaken to explore the modifications produced by CBZ on ionic currents (e.g., INa and erg-mediated K+ current [IK(erg)]) measured from Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. In these cells, we found that this drug differentially suppressed the peak (transient, INa(T)) and sustained (late, INa(L)) components of INa in a concentration-dependent manner with effective IC50 of 56 and 18 \u03bcM, respectively. The overall current\u2013voltage relationship of INa(T) with or without the addition of CBZ remained unchanged; however, the strength (i.e., \u2206area) in the window component of INa (INa(W)) evoked by the short ascending ramp pulse (Vramp) was overly lessened in the CBZ presence. Tefluthrin (Tef), a synthetic pyrethroid, known to stimulate INa, augmented the strength of the voltage-dependent hysteresis (Hys(V)) of persistent INa (INa(P)) in response to the isosceles-triangular Vramp; moreover, further application of CBZ attenuated Tef-mediated accentuation of INa(P)\u2019s Hys(V). With a two-step voltage protocol, the recovery of INa(T) inactivation seen in Neuro-2a cells became progressively slowed by adding CBZ; however, the cumulative inhibition of INa(T) evoked by pulse train stimulation was enhanced during exposure to this drug. Neuro-2a-cell exposure to CBZ (100 \u03bcM), the magnitude of erg-mediated K+ current measured throughout the entire voltage-clamp steps applied was mildly inhibited. The docking results regarding the interaction of CBZ and voltage-gate Na+ (NaV) channel predicted the ability of CBZ to bind to some amino-acid residues in NaV due to the existence of a hydrogen bond or hydrophobic contact. It is conceivable from the current investigations that the INa (INa(T), INa(L), INa(W), and INa(P)) residing in Neuro-2a cells are susceptible to being suppressed by CBZ, and that its block on INa(L) is larger than that on INa(T). Collectively, the magnitude and gating of NaV channels produced by the CBZ presence might have an impact on its anticonvulsant and analgesic effects occurring in vivo.",

Despite many decades of intensive research, causal treatment of this common neurologic disorder is still unavailable. Nevertheless, it is expected that advances in modern neuroscience and molecular biology tools, as well as improved animal models may accelerate designing antiepileptogenic and epilepsy-modifying drugs. Epileptogenesis triggers a vast array of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, which ultimately lead to morphological and functional transformation of specific neuronal circuits resulting in the occurrence of spontaneous convulsive or nonconvulsive seizures. Recent decades unraveled molecular processes and biochemical signaling pathways involved in the proepileptic transformation of brain circuits including oxidative stress, apoptosis, neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors. The \u201comics\u201d data derived from both human and animal epileptic tissues, as well as electrophysiological, imaging and neurochemical analysis identified a plethora of possible molecular targets for drugs, which could interfere with various stages of epileptogenetic cascade, including inflammatory processes and neuroplastic changes. In this narrative review, we briefly present contemporary views on the neurobiological background of epileptogenesis and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of some more promising molecular targets for antiepileptogenic pharmacotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Tefluthrin (Tef) is categorized as a type-I pyrethroid insecticide, telmisartan (Tel) functions as an angiotensin II receptor blocker, and KB-R7943 has been identified as an inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange process. However, the influence of these compounds on the amplitude and gating properties of voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) in neurons associated with pain signaling remains unclear. In cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, whole-cell current recordings revealed that Tef or Tel increased the peak amplitude of INa, concomitant with an elevation in the time constant of INa inactivation, particularly in the slow component. Conversely, exposure to KB-R7943 resulted in a depression in INa, coupled with a decrease in the slow component of the inactivation time constant of INa. Theoretical simulations and bifurcation analyses were performed on a modeled interneuron in the spinal dorsal horn. The occurrence of INa inactivation accentuated the subthreshold oscillations (SO) in the membrane potential. With an increase in applied current, SO became more pronounced, accompanied by the emergence of high-frequency spiking (HS) with a frequency of approximately 150 Hz. Moreover, an elevation in INa conductance further intensified both SO and HF. Consequently, through experimental and in silico studies, this work reflects that Tef, Tel, or KB-R7943 significantly impacts the magnitude and gating properties of INa in neurons associated with pain signaling. The alterations in INa magnitude and gating in these neurons suggest a close relationship with pain transmission.",

        "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the impact of KB-R7943 on voltage-gated Na+ currents, which is a key aspect of the source paper. Additionally, the paper explores the effects of other compounds on Na+ currents, but KB-R7943's role is directly related to the source paper's findings."
