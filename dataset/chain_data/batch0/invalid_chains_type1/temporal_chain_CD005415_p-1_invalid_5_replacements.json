        "title": "Drug treatments in upper gastrointestinal bleeding: value of endoscopic findings as surrogate end points",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Pharmacotherapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding has been difficult to evaluate because clinical end points are infrequent and affected by other factors. AIMS To evaluate whether blood in the stomach at endoscopy reflected severity of bleeding, predicted clinical outcomes, and could be altered by therapeutic agents. METHODS We studied 414 consecutive admissions with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were randomised to receive lansoprazole 60 mg followed by 30 mg four times daily, tranexamic acid 2 g followed by 1 g four times daily, both drugs, or placebo for four days, until discharge or a clinical end point occurred. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of endoscopic changes and clinical outcomes, and to investigate the effects of drug treatments on blood in the stomach. RESULTS Of 414 patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 379 were endoscoped. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was confirmed in 316. Sixteen required surgery within 30 days and 16 died on the index admission. Trial treatments were evaluable on a per protocol basis in 228 patients. The amount of blood in the stomach was found to reflect initial risk, with significant associations with high risk categorisation (odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.5\u20139.4) for more than a trace v none/trace), age (1.5 (1.1\u20131.9) per decade), and initial pulse (1.02 (1.00\u20131.04) per beat), and to predict rebleeding (9.2 (4.6\u201318.7)) and surgery (8.2 (2.9\u201322.9)). Other stigmata were less significant in these respects. The amount of blood in the stomach at endoscopy was reduced significantly by both lansoprazole (0.22 (0.07\u20130.63)) and tranexamic acid (0.27 (0.09\u20130.81)), although there was no evidence of synergy. CONCLUSIONS Blood in the stomach reflects clinical features in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is reduced by treatment with lansoprazole and tranexamic acid.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a pilot, non-randomized trial we tested the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent fibrinolytic inhibitor, as adjunctive therapy in standard treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty consecutive patients (12 male, eight female; 63+/-8 years) with 36 episodes of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding were included in the study. In 16 episodes of bleeding TXA was used (in a dosage of 20 mg intravenously, followed for the next 4 weeks by 10 mg/kg/48 h orally), whereas in 20 other cases of bleeding, TXA was not used. The decision to use TXA was left to the attending physician's clinical judgement, resulting in all the more severe cases of bleeding being treated with TXA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment including TXA was shown to be beneficial (relative to cases not treated with TXA) in terms of decreasing the rate of early re-bleeding (in the first week, 0 vs 6, P<0.05), the rate of early and late re-bleeding (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05), the rate of repeated endoscopic procedures (in the first month, 1 vs 8, P<0.05) and the number of blood transfusions needed (in the first month, 1.4+/-1.3 vs 2.6+/-1.5 units, P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this pilot study suggest that TXA can be beneficial in the treatment of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dialysis patients. This remains to be definitely confirmed in a randomized study.",

        "title": "The effect of long term, low-dose tranexamic acid treatment on platelet dysfunction and haemoglobin levels in haemodialysis patients",
        "abstract": "Summary Some previous studies suggest that activation of the fibrinolytic system may induce platelet dysfunction in haemodialysis patients. Accordingly, inhibition of fibrinolysis may improve platelet dysfunction, and speculatively increase haemoglobin levels. We tested this hypothesis. The study group comprised 22 patients (14 male, 8 female, median age 62), who had been on maintenance haemodialysis for more than one year. Patients were treated for three months with low-dose tranexamic acid (TXA), a potent anti-fibrinolytic agent. The dosages of erythropoietin and the haemodialysis procedure were not changed significantly during the study. We primarily followed platelet function (by in vitro closure time test) and haemoglobin values. Patients were divided into those with substantially prolonged (N=9) and those with slightly delayed or normal (N=13) in vitro closure time. Treatment with TXA resulted in a significant improvement of platelet function and increased levels of haemoglobin in the first group, and no changes in either platelet function or haemoglobin values in the second group. TXA in the dosage used was biologically active, since a significant decrease in plasminogen and D-dimer were found in both groups. No significant changes in other fibrinolytic parameters or von Willebrand factor were found. No complications in terms of arterial or venous thrombosis were observed. Our pilot study suggests that long term, low-dose TXA treatment of haemodialysis patients with substantially prolonged in vitro closure time results in a significant improvement of platelet dysfunction and a significant increase in haemoglobin values. These new, promising results merit further investigation in larger studies.",

The bleeding could not be controlled by intensive conservative treatment, it became life-threatening and urgent bilateral nephrectomy was intended. Since local and systemic hyperfibrinolysis play a role in bleeding in ADPKD patients, we tried TXA treatment. In fact, the massive bleeding promptly stopped, and haematuria gradually ceased. Removal of both kidneys was prevented. After 5 days both ureters became obstructed by blood clots, but placing J-catheters in each pyelon successfully solved this complication. Our case shows that it is reasonable to try antifibrinolytic treatment with TXA in such devastating uncontrolled bleeding.",

        "abstract": "This is the first report of a case of a reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function in a patient with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) receiving rapamycin. A 42-year-old man with ADPKD and a severe persistent bleeding from his solitary left kidney was successfully treated with tranexamic acid (TXA). He also received low-dose rapamycin for 8 months, and this was associated with a 23.5% reduction in kidney volume, improvement and stabilization of renal function, and normalization of haemoglobin levels. When treatment with rapamycin was interrupted, renal function deteriorated within an 8-month period and haemodialysis (HD) became necessary. Kidney volume increased at once, and life-threatening bleeding prompted a nephrectomy 4 months after the onset of HD. These data suggest that the reduction in kidney volume and preservation of renal function with rapamycin could be the result of the antiangiogenic, antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.",

To address this limitation, we tested the efficacy of rapamycin in a mouse model that results from conditional inactivation of Pkd1. Mosaic deletion of Pkd1 resulted in PKD and replicated characteristic features of human PKD including aberrant mTOR activation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis, and progressive fibrosis. Treatment with rapamycin was highly effective: It reduced cyst growth, preserved renal function, inhibited epithelial cell proliferation, increased apoptosis of cyst-lining cells, and inhibited fibrosis. These data provide in vivo evidence that rapamycin is effective in a human-orthologous mouse model of PKD.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in polycystin-1 (PC1) lead to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a leading cause of renal failure for which no treatment is available. PC1 is an integral membrane protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that membrane-anchored PC1 activates STAT3 in a JAK2-dependent manner, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC1 can undergo proteolytic cleavage and nuclear translocation. Tail-cleavage abolishes the ability of PC1 to directly activate STAT3 but the cleaved PC1 tail now coactivates STAT3 in a mechanism requiring STAT phosphorylation by cytokines or growth factors. This leads to an exaggerated cytokine response. Hence, PC1 can regulate STAT activity by a dual mechanism. In ADPKD kidneys PC1 tail fragments are overexpressed, including a unique \u223c15-kDa fragment (P15). STAT3 is strongly activated in cyst-lining epithelial cells in human ADPKD, and orthologous and nonorthologous polycystic mouse models. STAT3 is also activated in developing, postnatal kidneys but inactivated in adult kidneys. These results indicate that STAT3 signaling is regulated by PC1 and is a driving factor for renal epithelial proliferation during normal renal development and during cyst growth.",

Cyst initiation and expansion arise from a combination of abnormal cell proliferation, fluid secretion and extracellular matrix defects and results in kidney enlargement and interstitial fibrosis. Since its first description over 200 years ago, ADPKD has been considered an untreatable condition and its management is limited to blood pressure reduction and symptomatic treatment of disease complications. Results of the recently reported TEMPO 3/4 trial thus represent a paradigm shift in demonstrating for the first time that cystic disease and loss of renal function can be slowed in humans. In this paper, we review the major therapeutic strategies currently being explored in ADPKD including a range of novel approaches in preclinical models. It is anticipated that the clinical management of ADPKD will undergo a revolution in the next decade with the translation of new treatments into routine clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Polycystin-1 (PC1) mutations result in proliferative renal cyst growth and progression to renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was shown to be activated in cyst-lining cells in ADPKD and PKD mouse models and may drive renal cyst growth, but the mechanisms leading to persistent STAT3 activation are unknown. A proteolytic fragment of PC1 corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail, PC1-p30, is overexpressed in ADPKD. Here, we show that PC1-p30 interacts with the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, resulting in Src-dependent activation of STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation. The PC1-p30-mediated activation of Src/STAT3 was independent of JAK family kinases and insensitive to the STAT3 inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. Signaling by the EGF receptor (EGFR) or cAMP amplified the activation of Src/STAT3 by PC1-p30. Expression of PC1-p30 changed the cellular response to cAMP signaling. In the absence of PC1-p30, cAMP dampened EGFR- or IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3; in the presence of PC1-p30, cAMP amplified Src-dependent activation of STAT3. In the polycystic kidney (PCK) rat model, activation of STAT3 in renal cystic cells depended on vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) signaling, which increased cAMP levels. Genetic inhibition of vasopressin expression or treatment with a pharmacologic V2R inhibitor strongly suppressed STAT3 activation and reduced renal cyst growth. These results suggest that PC1, via its cleaved cytoplasmic tail, integrates signaling inputs from EGFR and cAMP, resulting in Src-dependent activation of STAT3 and a proliferative response.",

        "abstract": "ABSTARCT Epidemiological and clinical studies have increasingly shown that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with a number of pathological respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which share the common feature of airway inflammation induced by particle exposure. Thus, understanding how PM2.5 triggers inflammatory responses in the respiratory system is crucial for the study of PM2.5 toxicity. In the current study, we found that exposing human bronchial epithelial cells (immortalized Beas-2B cells and primary cells) to PM2.5 collected in the winter in Wuhan, a city in southern China, induced a significant upregulation of VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) production, a signaling event that typically functions to control chronic airway inflammation and vascular remodeling. Further investigations showed that macroautophagy/autophagy was induced upon PM2.5 exposure and then mediated VEGFA upregulation by activating the SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase)-STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway in bronchial epithelial cells. By exploring the upstream signaling events responsible for autophagy induction, we revealed a requirement for TP53 (tumor protein p53) activation and the expression of its downstream target DRAM1 (DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 1) for the induction of autophagy. These results thus extend the role of TP53-DRAM1-dependent autophagy beyond cell fate determination under genotoxic stress and to the control of proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, PM2.5 exposure strongly induced the activation of the ATR (ATR serine/threonine kinase)-CHEK1/CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1) axis, which subsequently triggered TP53-dependent autophagy and VEGFA production in Beas-2B cells. Therefore, these findings suggest a novel link between processes regulating genomic integrity and airway inflammation via autophagy induction in bronchial epithelial cells under PM2.5 exposure.",

        "abstract": "Aims: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress and has also been shown to regulate processes related to cancer progression. In this regard, HO-1 has been shown to display a dual effect with either antitumor or protumor activity, which is also true for breast cancer (BC). In this work, we address this discrepancy regarding the role of HO-1 in BC. Results: HO-1 was detected in human BC tissues, and its protein levels correlated with reduced tumor size and longer overall survival time of patients, thus suggesting the clinical importance of HO-1 in this type of cancer. Contrariwise, nuclear localization of HO-1 correlated with higher tumor grade suggesting that the effect of HO-1 is dependent on its cellular localization. In vivo experiments showed that both pharmacological activation and genetic overexpression of HO-1 reduce the tumor burden in two different animal models of BC. Furthermore, the pharmacological and genetic activation of HO-1 in several BC cell lines reduce the cellular viability by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and decrease the cellular migration and invasion rates by modulating pathways involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, HO-1 activation impaired in vivo the metastatic dissemination. Innovation and Conclusion: By using various BC cell lines and animal models as well as human tumor samples, we demonstrated that total HO-1 displays antitumor activities in BC. Furthermore, our study suggests that HO-1 subcellular localization may explain the differential effects observed for the protein in different tumor types.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Despite decades of extensive study into targeting cell death in breast cancer, including apoptosis, the clinical treatment remains challenging due to its high probability of recurrence. As an emerging form of cell death, ferroptosis features suppression of drug resistance and augmentation of antitumor immunity. The advances in the development of clinical drugs targeting ferroptosis provide growing silver linings for breast cancer treatment. Research into biomarkers to precisely trace ferroptosis in patients with cancer, and the development and subsequent application of novel ferroptosis-based therapies will be of critical importance in the next few years. Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. The discovery of regulated cell death processes has enabled advances in the treatment of BC. In the past decade, ferroptosis, a new form of iron-dependent regulated cell death caused by excessive lipid peroxidation has been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of BC. Intriguingly, the induction of ferroptosis acts to suppress conventional therapy-resistant cells, and to potentiate the effects of immunotherapy. As such, pharmacological or genetic modulation targeting ferroptosis holds great potential for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers. In this review, we present a critical analysis of the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks involved in ferroptosis, the potential physiological functions of ferroptosis in tumor suppression, its potential in therapeutic targeting, and explore recent advances in the development of therapeutic strategies for BC.",
