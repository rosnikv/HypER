Crossover data showed that improvement occurred in 26 of 39 courses of 6-MP (67%) as compared with three of 39 courses of placebo (8%) (P less than 0.001). Non-crossover data likewise confirmed the superiority of 6-MP. The drug was more effective than placebo in closing fistulas (31 vs 6%) and in permitting discontinuation or reduction of steroid dosage (75 vs. 36%) (P less than 0.001). The onset of response to 6-MP was often delayed, with 32% of patients taking longer than three months to respond, and 19% taking longer than four months. Adverse side effects to 6-MP occurred in 10% of patients and were uniformly reversible. We conclude that 6-MP is an effective and useful agent in the management of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "EXTERNAL fistulas are a characteristic of Crohn\u2018s disease, occurring in I S -20 per cent of patients ( I . 2). They usually pass through the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. I ) but they can surface in the perineum or on the buttocks. In most instances the amount of discharge of pus and faeces from the fistula is small and some patients cope with it by wearing dressings rather than a bag. Nevertheless, it is often sufficient in quantity to cause sore skin and to soil clothing. Many of these patients have already undergone operations which have failed to control or have even provoked the fistula. Others have been told that their problem is not amenable to surgical treatment. a belief still held by some physicians and an occasional surgeon. and which is just not true. Virtually all external fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease can be successfully closed as long as certain basic rules are followed. However, it has to be admitted that an occasional fistula defies closure. and in others refistulation from a different site somctimes occurs. External fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease are of two types. Type I fistulas are those that arise from a segment of bowel, often the terminal ileum, involved by active disease. The inflamed bowel becomes attached to the abdominal wall which itself becomes inflamed and the site of abscess formation. The point of attachment is often in the right iliac fossa (Fig. I ) or to the inside of a laparotomy scar, especially when this has been recently performed (Fig. 2 ) . Such fistulas form following spontaneous or induced drainage of an abscess pointing on the abdominal surface. Type 1 fistulas nearly always require operation to close them. Tipe 2 fistulas are those that follow breakdown of an anastomosis undertaken following resection of bowel involved with Crohn\u2019s disease. Most fistulas of this type. given correct treatment, will heal spontaneously. In this respect their management differs fundamentally from type 1 fistulas.",

        "abstract": "Fifty\u2010two patients with Crohn's disease have been assessed using acute phase proteins and a scoring system. Thirty\u2010nine underwent operation and intra\u2010abdominal abscesses were found in seventeen. Both scores and acute phase proteins have been shown to reflect inflammation due to secondary sepsis in addition to that from active Crohn's disease. The scores were higher, and acute phase changes greater, in patients with sepsis than those without. By choosing a threshold for each variable that excludes patients without sepsis it has been found that a score > 181, ESR >45 mm/h, CRP >33 mg/l, orosomucoid >1.8g/l and albumin < 26.7 g/l identify sepsis with a specificity >95 per cent and sensitivity > 35 per cent. Over 70 per cent of patients with abscesses exceeded one or more of these thresholds. We believe that operative management should be strongly considered if one or more of these criteria are positive as such patients have a greater than 90 per cent chance of having an intra\u2010abdominal abscess. This will prevent these abscesses eroding into adjacent viscera or to the surface with resulting fistula formation.",

The serum concentrations of serum amyloid A protein (SAA), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1\u2010antichymotrypsin (alpha 1\u2010ACT) and alpha 1\u2010acid glycoprotein (alpha 1\u2010AGP) have been measured in eighty\u2010six patients with Crohn's disease, twenty\u2010five patients with ulcerative colitis and twenty\u2010two patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. In the Crohn's and ulcerative colitis group significant increases in concentration were observed in all four proteins, which parallelled disease severity as defined by other conventional laboratory parameters formulated into a simple activity index. In the irritable bowel group no significant changes were seen. Serum amyloid A and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease when mild, but did not differ significantly when severe. Serum amyloid A correlated well with CRP (r= 0\u00b783) and alpha 1\u2010ACT (r= 0\u00b780), but less well with alpha 1\u2010AGP (r= 0\u00b765). Serum amyloid A was the most sensitive protein (77%) but had the lowest specificity (74%). C\u2010reactive protein was less sensitive (58%) than SAA but had greater specificity (100%). Alpha 1\u2010ACT had a sensitivity and specificity similar to CRP and, therefore, provided little or no additional information. Alpha 1\u2010AGP, although also 100% specific, had the lowest sensitivity (34%) and, therefore, is probably the least useful acute phase monitor of inflammatory bowel disease. The role, and associated problems, of SAA measurements are discussed.",

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 of these patients to generate soluble interleukin-2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations of patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 19) were significantly elevated (757 +/- 438 U/ml) compared with levels in patients with inactive disease (n = 10; 412 +/- 120 U/ml) and healthy control individuals (n = 40; 375 +/- 102 U/ml; p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). Serial determinations of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration in a follow-up of 11 hospitalized patients treated for highly active disease showed a decrease from 1252 +/- 494 U/ml to 527 +/- 193 U/ml (p less than 0.004) that corresponded to clinical improvement, as assessed by Crohn's disease activity index and a reduction of inflammatory parameters. In vitro phytohemagglutinin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn's disease resulted in elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor production not only in patients with active disease (3987 +/- 2439 U/ml), but also in patients with inactive disease (3297 +/- 2282 U/ml), compared with the amount of soluble interleukin-2 receptor produced by mononuclear cells of healthy individuals (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, cultivation of mononuclear cells without mitogen resulted in higher soluble interleukin-2 receptor production in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.02). However, patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis also had significantly increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (1080 +/- 400 U/ml) compared with the levels in patients with chronic disease (455 +/- 140 U/ml; p less than 0.0025). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with ulcerative colitis produced significantly more soluble interleukin-2 receptor upon mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (2314 +/- 936 U/ml), than cells from healthy controls (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.05). The finding of elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels in patients with active Crohn's disease and its increased production by mononuclear cells of patients with both active and inactive disease is a further example of an alteration of the immune system in this condition; however, this alteration can also be found in other inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "title": "The urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori.",
        "abstract": "The urea breath test (UBT) is the most important noninvasive test for Helicobacter pyloni. It is easy to perform, reliable, comparatively cheap, and without risk to patients. Its main indication is in follow up after attempted H pyloni eradication and hence it has important advantages over the other main non-invasive test, serology. The UBT is already widely used as a research tool and deserves wider use in routine clinical practice. Helicobacter pylori produces large amounts of a powerful urease enzyme the detection of which forms the basis of the UBT. Gastric urease was first reported in 1923 by Luck who described hydrolysis ofurea in the stomachs ofdogs and other animals' and it was not long before humans were added to the list.2 In the 1950s Kornberg used a forerunner of the UBT in anaesthetised cats to show that antibiotics destroyed urease activity and thus concluded that urease was bacterial in origin.3 The discovery ofH pyloii by Warren and Marshall in 19834 was not at first linked to gastric urease (the bacterium was thought to be urease negative!5) but the relation soon became obvious.6 The benefit of urease to H pylori is still much debated but its usefulness in diagnosis was quickly recognised and in 1985 the biopsy urease test was first described in a modified form by McNaulty.' In 1987 Graham described the first UBT specifically designed to detect H pyloni using urea labelled with the stable isotope '3C,8 and his description was quickly followed by reports of UBTs using the radioactive isotope '4C from the UK,9 Australia,'\" and The Netherlands.\" The principle of the UBT is simple. Urea isotopically labelled with 13C or '4C is given orally and ifH pyloii is present in the stomach its urease enzyme hydrolyses the urea producing isotopically labelled carbon dioxide. This diffuses into blood, is excreted by the lungs, and can be detected in breath. Many refinements to this essentially simple test have been described, the importance of which depends upon the information required from the test and the situations in which it is to be used. In the primary diagnosis of gastroduodenal pathology, endoscopy based tests are indicated rather than UBTs. Endoscopy gives much more information than just whether Hpylori is present in the stomach and this helps when making treatment decisions, including whether or not to treat the infection. In situations, however, where knowledge of H pylori status alone is needed UBTs have obvious advantages; they are without risk, well tolerated, comparatively cheap, and do not require experienced operators. Thus the main indication for UBT is after attempted H pylori eradication in those situations where follow up endoscopy is unnecessary. Checking eradication is important as treatment failure is comparatively common and the success or failure of treatment has important implications for further treatment and follow up and for patient advice or reassurance. Follow up after treatment is not, however, the only indication for breath testing. Others include checking for infection when an ulcer is found on barium meal and checking for infection when an ulcer is found at endoscopy but biopsy specimens cannot be taken because of anticoagulant treatment. The information needed from a UBT is whether or not H pyloni infection is present. In some research situations it may be desirable to quantify urease activity but in clinical situations this is not necessary and UBT protocols should be kept simple and not made more complicated to try to obtain this information. The aim should be to discriminate accurately between H pylori positive and negative patients while minimising inconvenience and cost. What are the causes of inaccuracies in the test? The commonest reason for false negative tests is breath testing too soon after a course of antibiotics,'0 bismuth89 or omeprazole\" whether given specifically as a treatment forH pylori or not. Breath testing should not be performed until at least one month after the end of such a course of treatment. ' \" False negative tests can also occur after gastric surgery, presumably because of rapid emptying of urea from the stomach, and false positive tests are possible if other urease producing bacteria are present in the stomach such as may occur in patients with achlorhydria from gastric atrophy.'4 Breath testing should be used with caution in these situations. Suboptimal UBT protocols are another potential cause of inaccurate results. In practice, however, most published protocols give similar accuracy with sensitivity ranging from 90-100% and specificity from 78100%\" 1524 when compared with biopsy based tests. The low specificity for UBT in some of these trials is misleading and merely reflects the low sensitivity of tests with which UBT is compared. As most UBT protocols give acceptable accuracy the decision about which to use must depend largely on other factors such as safety, cost, convenience to the patient and operator, and speed at which results can be available. These factors in turn depend mainly on whether the '3C or '4C UBT is used, as both have practical problems and advantages arising to a large extent from the theoretical problems and advantages of '3C and 'C as isotopic markers. The main theoretical problem for the '3C UBT is that '3C occurs naturally and at somewhat variable concentrations, usually being present in about 1-11% of expired carbon dioxide. In a positive breath test this may, for example, increase by just 0 01% to reach 1-12% a tiny increase on a 723",

        "abstract": "Peripheral lung tissue contains large numbers of T cells, strategically located for immune surveillance at the blood\u2013air interface. Given the intensity of antigenic exposure at this site, it is clear that local T\u2010cell activation events require strict control, in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. How this control is achieved in this unique tissue microenvironment is unknown, and the present study sought to elucidate the process via detailed analysis of the surface phenotypic characteristics of freshly isolated lung T cells. We report below that these cells display typical characteristic of \u2018postactivation\u2019, notably elevated basal Ca2+ concentrations, down\u2010modulated T\u2010cell receptors, expression of Ia and \u2018late\u2019 activation antigens and concomitant CD4/CD8.

        "abstract": "Summary: Experimental data indicate that mucosal CD4+ T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Based on the pattern of cytokine production, CD4+ T cells may be distinguished into two different phenotypes. Th1 responses are characterized by secretion of interleukin (IL)\u20102, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr;, lymphotoxin, and interferon (IFN)\u2010&ggr; and are associated with delayedtype hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Th2 responses, which are characterized by secretion of IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010, have been associated with humoral immune responses and allergy. To assess the number of IFN\u2010&agr; and IL\u20104 positive cells in IBD and normal intestinal specimens, frozen sections from intestinal specimens from 10 Crohn's disease (CD), 8 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 healthy controls were examined by immunohistochemistry. Monoclonal antibodies for CD3, CD8, IFN\u2010&ggr;, and IL\u20104 were used. T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration and cytokine expression by epithelial, lamina propria, and submucosal cells were scored on a four\u2010point scale by two independent observers who were blinded for the clinical data. One\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was used for statistical analysis. In intestinal specimens from IBD patients, the number of CD3+ cells was found increased in the lamina propria and, within the submucosa, this increase was significant (p < 0.001). In CD the number of lamina propria IFN\u2010&ggr; positive cells was significantly increased as compared with controls (p < 0.002). In UC the number of both IFN\u2010&ggr; and IL\u20104 producing cells in the lamina propria was not significantly increased as compared with controls.

Neutralization of CXCL10 protected mice from epithelial ulceration by promoting crypt cell survival without evidence of altered immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, recombinant CXCL10 administration into mice inhibited intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. These findings suggest that CXCL10 regulates crypt cell growth to maintain intestinal homeostasis in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.

Although pDCs alone failed to induce CTLs, in vivo depletion of pDCs impaired CTL-mediated virus eradication. LNDCs from pDC-depleted mice showed impaired cluster formation with T cells and antigen presentation to prime CTLs. Transferring circulating pDC precursors from wild-type, but not CXCR3-deficient, mice to pDC-depleted mice restored CTL induction by impaired LNDCs. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that pDCs provided help signals that recovered impaired LNDCs in a CD2- and CD40L-dependent manner. pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 further stimulated the recovered LNDCs to induce CTLs. Therefore, the help provided by pDCs for LNDCs in primary immune responses seems to be pivotal to optimally inducing anti-HSV CTLs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The precise role of each of the seven individual CD11c+ dendritic cell subsets (DCs) identified to date in the response to viral infections is not known. DCs serve as critical links between the innate and adaptive immune responses against many pathogens, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The role of DCs as mediators of resistance to HSV-1 infection was investigated using CD11c-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, in which DCs can be transiently depleted in vivo by treatment with low doses of DT. We show that ablation of DCs led to enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the highly resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. Specifically, we showed that the depletion of DCs led to increased viral spread into the nervous system, resulting in an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we showed that ablation of DCs impaired the optimal activation of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to HSV-1. These data demonstrated that DCs were essential not only in the optimal activation of the acquired T-cell response to HSV-1 but also that DCs were crucial for innate resistance to HSV-1 infection.",

        "abstract": "Summary: If one envisions dendritic cells (DCs) as nature's adjuvant, then it is easy to predict that they would be advantageous for cancer immunotherapy. Advances in culture processes that generate large numbers of purified and functionally mature DCs raised the possibility that DCs might be promising clinical agents to generate effective immune responses against cancer. The use of mature DCs as cellular vaccines was proposed to be superior to conventional strategies aimed at treating cancer, yet a phase III clinical trial in patients with melanoma demonstrated no increased benefit of DCs over standard therapy. Despite this and other apparent failures, we propose that DC\u2010based therapy should not be discarded but rather reassessed. The heterogeneity of DCs and their interaction with other innate cells and regulatory and effector pathways must be clearly understood before the full therapeutic benefit of DCs are recognized. Several aspects of DC vaccination require optimization including the following: effective delivery of vaccines to DCs in lymphoid tissues; incorporation of components that induce appropriate DC activation; and facilitation of innate and adaptive interactions and reduction of regulatory T\u2010cell networks or suppressive microenvironments that hinder the function of immune effectors. Application of this knowledge is resulting in encouraging new data in pre\u2010clinical settings, where multiple arms of the immune system are targeted for cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "The genome of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes 86 proteins, but only a limited set is expressed in EBV\u2013growth transformed B cells, termed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). These cells proliferate via the concerted action of EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and latent membrane proteins (LMPs), some of which are rate limiting to establish a stable homeostasis of growth promoting and anti-apoptotic activities. We show here that EBV mutants, which lack the EBNA-3A gene, are impaired but can still initiate cell cycle entry and proliferation of primary human B cells in contrast to an EBNA-2 deficient mutant virus. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous reports, these viral mutants are attenuated in growth transformation assays but give rise to permanently growing EBNA-3A negative B cell lines which exhibit reduced proliferation rates and elevated levels of apoptosis. Expression profiles of EBNA-3A deficient LCLs are characterized by 129 down-regulated and 167 up-regulated genes, which are significantly enriched for genes involved in apoptotic processes or cell cycle progression like the tumor suppressor gene p16/INK4A, or might contribute to essential steps of the viral life cycle in the infected host. In addition, EBNA-3A cellular target genes remarkably overlap with previously identified targets of EBNA-2. This study comprises the first genome wide expression profiles of EBNA-3A target genes generated within the complex network of viral proteins of the growth transformed B cell and permits a more detailed understanding of EBNA-3A's function and contribution to viral pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Alveolar Type II (ATII) cells are important targets for seasonal and pandemic influenza. To investigate the influenza-induced innate immune response in those cells, we measured the global gene expression profile of highly differentiated ATII cells infected with the influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 at 4 hours and 24 hours after inoculation. Infection with influenza stimulated a significant increase in the mRNA concentrations of many host defense-related genes, including pattern/pathogen recognition receptors, IFN, and IFN-induced genes, chemokines, and suppressors of cytokine signaling. We verified these changes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At the protein level, we detected a robust virus-induced secretion of the three glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR)-negative chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, according to ELISA. The ultraviolet inactivation of virus abolished the chemokine and cytokine response. Viral infection did not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, as measured by cellular mRNA and concentrations of surfactant proteins. However, viral infection significantly reduced the secretion of surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D. In addition, influenza A virus triggered a time-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in ATII cells. The inhibition of this pathway significantly decreased the release of infectious virus and the chemokine response, but did not alter virus-induced cell death. This study provides insights into influenza-induced innate immunity in differentiated human ATII cells, and demonstrates that the alveolar epithelium is a critical part of the initial innate immune response to influenza.",

        "abstract": "Various cell types can produce the chemokine CXCL10 in response to IFN-\u03b3 stimulation. CXCL10 is generally viewed as a proinflammatory chemokine that promotes recruitment of CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ effector T cells to infected or inflamed nonlymphoid tissues. We show that CXCL10 plays a role during CD8+ T cell priming in the mouse. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed the Cxcl10 gene as a target of CD27/CD70 costimulation in newly activated CD8+ T cells. CD27/CD70 costimulation is known to promote activated T cell survival, but CXCL10 did not affect survival or proliferation of primed CD8+ T cells in vitro. Accordingly, CXCL10 could not fully rescue CD27 deficiency in mice infected with influenza virus. Rather, CXCL10 acted as chemoattractant for other activated CD8+ T cells. It signaled downstream of CD27 in a paracrine fashion to promote generation of the CD8+ effector T cell pool in the Ag-draining lymph nodes. Consistently, CD8+ T cells required expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 for their clonal expansion in a CD27/CD70-dependent peptide-immunization model. Our findings indicate that CXCL10, produced by primed CD8+ T cells in response to CD27/CD70 costimulation, signals to other primed CD8+ T cells in the lymph node microenvironment to facilitate their participation in the CD8+ effector T cell pool.",

        "abstract": "In 2013, cancer immunotherapy was named 'breakthrough of the year' based on the outcome of clinical trials with blocking antibodies to the T-cell co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1. This success has emphasized that cytotoxic T-cell responses to cancer can occur, but are limited by peripheral tolerance and by immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Targeting of CTLA-4, PD-1 or its ligands partly overcomes these limitations and can now be applied in multiple immunogenic cancer types. Furthermore, an increased success rate is expected from combining CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 blocking with deliberate engagement of T-cell co-stimulatory receptors, particularly TNF receptor (R) family members. The TNFR family includes CD27 (Tnfrsf7), for which an agonistic antibody has recently entered clinical trials. In this review, we describe how CD27 co-stimulation impacts the T-cell response, with the purpose to illuminate how CD27 agonism can be exploited in cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Development of social cognition, a unique and high-order function, depends on brain maturation from childhood to adulthood in humans. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia have similar social cognitive deficits, although age of onset in each disorder is different. Pathogenesis of these disorders is complex and contains several features, including genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors, and sites of abnormalities in the brain. Although several hypotheses have been postulated, they seem to be insufficient to explain how brain alterations associated with symptoms in these disorders develop at distinct developmental stages. Development of ASD appears to be related to cerebellar dysfunction and subsequent thalamic hyperactivation in early childhood. By contrast, schizophrenia seems to be triggered by thalamic hyperactivation in late adolescence, whereas hippocampal aberration has been possibly initiated in childhood. One of the possible culprits is metal homeostasis disturbances that can induce dysfunction of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Thalamic hyperactivation is thought to be induced by microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and abnormalities of intracerebral environment. Consequently, it is likely that the thalamic hyperactivation triggers dysregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for lower brain regions related to social cognition. In this review, we summarize the brain aberration in ASD and schizophrenia and provide a possible mechanism underlying social cognitive deficits in these disorders based on their distinct ages of onset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus low-intensity continuous training (LICT) on transcriptional levels of neurotrophic factors and oligodendrocyte/microglia cell loss in a cuprizone (CP) induced animal model of demyelination. Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to six groups: control (C), cuprizone-induced demyelination (CP), interval training (IT), continuous training (CT), IT plus CP (ITCP), and CT plus CP (CTCP). Training programs on the treadmill were performed for four weeks, and then demyelination was induced by feeding mice a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for five weeks. Animals that received cuprizone showed poorer motor function, lower expression of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, and fewer oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus compared to the control animals. The numbers of oligodendrocyte and microglia cells increased in the ITCP group compared to the CTCP group (P<0.05). Both training programs increased the mRNA levels of BDNF, GDNF and NGF, and the HIIT program was more effective than the LICT program (P<0.05). Both exercise programs prevented the abnormal neurological movements induced by cuprizone. Our results indicated that HIIT versus LICT had a greater neuroprotective effect against multiple sclerosis by improving gene expression for abnormal neurotrophins and cellular loss in the hippocampus.",

        "abstract": "The water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is required for a normal rate of water exchange across the blood\u2013brain interface. Following the discovery that AQP4 is a possible autoantigen in neuromyelitis optica, the function of AQP4 in health and disease has become a research focus. While several studies have addressed the expression and function of AQP4 during inflammatory demyelination, relatively little is known about its expression during non-autoimmune-mediated myelin damage. In this study, we used the toxin-induced demyelination model cuprizone as well as a combination of metabolic and autoimmune myelin injury (i.e., Cup/EAE) to investigate AQP4 pathology. We show that during toxin-induced demyelination, diffuse AQP4 expression increases, while polarized AQP4 expression at the astrocyte endfeet decreases. The diffuse increased expression of AQP4 was verified in chronic-active multiple sclerosis lesions. Around inflammatory brain lesions, AQP4 expression dramatically decreased, especially at sites where peripheral immune cells penetrate the brain parenchyma. Humoral immune responses appear not to be involved in this process since no anti-AQP4 antibodies were detected in the serum of the experimental mice. We provide strong evidence that the diffuse increase in anti-AQP4 staining intensity is due to a metabolic injury to the brain, whereas the focal, perivascular loss of anti-AQP4 immunoreactivity is mediated by peripheral immune cells.",
