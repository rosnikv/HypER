The drug is well tolerated, and its metabolic effects include improvements in blood glucose and lipid control. Vascular effects consist of improvements in endothelial function and hypertension, and a reduction in surrogate markers of artherosclerosis. In a large, placebo-controlled, outcome study in secondary prevention, PROactive study, the use of pioglitazone in addition to an existing optimized macrovascular risk management resulted in a significant reduction of macrovascular endpoints within a short observation period that was comparable to the effect of statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in other trials. These results underline the value of pioglitazone for managing the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with a metabolic syndrome or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

        "title": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: Targets for the treatment of metabolic illnesses (Review).",
        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to a family of transcription factors of which three isotypes, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4 (\u03b2) and PPAR\u03b3, are known. These play a central role in regulating intermediate metabolism and in incidences of inflammation. In recent years, a greater understanding of their mechanisms of action and their effects, principally in the management of cardiovascular disease, has been achieved. PPAR agonists, catalysts and agents have been used since the 1990s, when it was confirmed that fibrates possess lipid modifying properties when selectively activating PPAR\u03b1. In addition, thiazolidinediones, structures analogous to fibrates, showed PPAR\u03b3 activity with an insulin-sensitizing effect, leading to their use in the control and even prevention of diabetes mellitus type 2. Currently, studies are oriented to the development of agents that activate multiple PPAR isoforms - not only dual (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3), but also PPAR panagonists (\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4). The purpose of this review is to explain the mechanisms of the molecular action and the effects of PPAR agonists, and also to analyze existing and current studies concerning their use in cardiovascular and metabolic illnesses.",

This analysis was part of a 24\u2010week trial, in which 964 insulin\u2010naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral agents (including metformin) were randomized to insulin glargine or detemir. Secretagogues were stopped or maintained at the site\u2010investigators' discretion. During the study, 57.6% of patients continued their secretagogue treatment. Compared with patients stopping secretagogues, those who continued experienced significantly more hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower: 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 versus 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 U/kg/day (p < 0.001). The difference between groups in mean HbA1c reduction was not statistically significant.

        "abstract": "Hypoglycemia has for the most part been studied inadequately for both of the commonly used long-acting insulin analogs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Almost all existing trials have been designed to investigate changes in glycemic control and not differences in hypoglycemia events. In this review, we present an overview of the hypoglycemic data available from the randomized controlled trials comparing insulin glargine and insulin detemir with NPH or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The limited head-to-head glargine versus detemir data are also discussed with comments on early results relating to the newer insulin analog, degludec. Basal insulin analogs are associated with reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Most studies have excluded participants with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia or previous severe events, however, and hypoglycemia reporting is variable and inconsistent. This limits interpretation for those with long-duration type 1 diabetes, and particularly impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, or long-duration more insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes. New optimally designed studies are required to elucidate the true impact of basal analogs on hypoglycemia burden in those living with long-term insulin therapy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultralong duration of action, and a rapid-acting insulin in a single injection. This trial compared IDegAsp with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with once- or twice-daily (OD or BID) pre- or self-mixed insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 26-week, randomized, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target trial, participants (mean age 58.7 years, duration of diabetes 13 years, BMI 29.3 kg/m2, and HbA1c 8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) were exposed (1:1) to BID injections of IDegAsp (n = 224) or BIAsp 30 (n = 222), administered with breakfast and the main evening meal and dose titrated to a self-measured premeal plasma glucose (PG) target of 4.0\u20135.0 mmol/L. RESULTS After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c was 7.1% (54 mmol/mol) for both groups, with IDegAsp achieving the prespecified noninferiority margin for mean change in HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] \u20130.03% points [95% CI \u20130.18 to 0.13]). Treatment with IDegAsp was superior in lowering fasting PG (ETD \u20131.14 mmol/L [95% CI \u20131.53 to \u20130.76], P < 0.001) and had a significantly lower final mean daily insulin dose (estimated rate ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.83\u20130.96], P = 0.002). Fewer confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemia episodes were reported for IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30. CONCLUSIONS IDegAsp BID effectively improves HbA1c and fasting PG levels with fewer hypoglycemia episodes versus BIAsp 30 in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes previously treated with once- or twice-daily pre- or self-mixed insulin.",

Methodology: This prospective, randomized, multicenter, comparative, non-inferiority, open-label, parallel group, phase IV study was conducted in 14 study centers in India. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either Glaritus\u00ae or Lantus\u00ae for 12 weeks. Each week, the dose of insulin was titrated to maintain target fasting blood glucose (FBG) level range of 80 - 120 mg/dL. Results: A total of 171 subjects were randomized (Glaritus\u00ae arm-86; Lantus\u00ae arm-85) and 161 subjects completed the study. The mean change in the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from visit 3 (baseline) to visit 6 (end of trial) in Glaritus\u00ae arm was -0.69 \u00b1 1.81 and in Lantus\u00ae arm was -0.53 \u00b1 1.94. The mean change in glucose levels between week 1 and end of week 11 in Glaritus\u00ae\u00a0arm was -8.81 \u00b1 34.57 and in Lantus\u00ae arm was -5.28 \u00b1 30. At least one hypoglycemic episode was experienced by 27.2% subjects of Glaritus\u00ae arm and 28.6% subjects of Lantus\u00ae arm. A total of 24 adverse events (AEs) such as pain, pyrexia, few infection related including urinary tract infections, metabolic related such as decreased appetite, musculoskeletal, neurological and skin related were reported in the study (Lantus\u00ae arm: 14 AEs; Glaritus\u00ae arm: 10 AEs).

A 12-week multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study was performed in 52 subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized to once-daily IDegAsp (n = 26) or basal insulin (n = 26). The primary endpoint was percent change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Furthermore, it was analyzed post hoc in subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c. During a follow-up period, percent change in HbA1c was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.161). Daily insulin doses and frequency of overall hypoglycemia were also similar in the two groups. In post hoc analyses, once-daily basal insulin was more effective than IDegAsp in subjects with HbA1c more than or equal to 8.5% (p < 0.05); however, in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant improvement in percent change in HbA1c at week 12, compared with basal insulin (p < 0.01). Although there was no apparent difference in the HbA1c-lowering effects between two groups, when compared in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant effect in comparison with once-daily basal insulin.
