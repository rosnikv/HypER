        "title": "Calcium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension: Assessment by office, home and ambulatory blood pressure",
        "abstract": "Objective To study the effects of a high calcium intake in hypertensive patients by blood pressure monitoring. Design In a randomized crossover study, patients were assigned to an 8-week calcium supplementation period and an 8-week control period. The subjects were given 25 mmol/day (1 g/day) of calcium as calcium carbonate during the intervention period. Setting A hypertension clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients Sixty untreated or treated hypertensive patients (35 men and 25 women, mean age 58 years) with office systolic/diastolic blood pressure \u2265 140/90 mmHg. Main outcome measures Office blood pressure, home blood pressure (last 7 days), and ambulatory 24 h blood pressure (every 30 min using TM-2421). Results The serum calcium concentration and urinary calcium excretion increased significantly with calcium supplementation. Office, home and 24 h blood pressure were lower in the calcium period than in the control period, although the differences were small (mean \u00b1 SEM office blood pressure: 1.2 \u00b1 1.2/1.1 \u00b1 0.7 mmHg; home blood pressure: 1.9 \u00b1 0.7/1.3 \u00b1 0.6 mmHg; 24 h blood pressure: 1.2 \u00b1 0.8/0.9 \u00b1 0.5 mmHg,), and significant only for home systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The difference in home systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with the level of home blood pressure in the control period and with the difference in urinary calcium. The difference in 24 h systolic blood pressure was positively correlated with the control level of urinary calcium. Age, sex, antihypertensive medication, drinking habit, sodium intake or order of treatment did not significantly influence the effects of calcium supplementation. Conclusions An increase in calcium intake tends to lower office, home and ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients. However, the antihypertensive effect is too small to support the general application of a high calcium intake in the treatment of hypertension.",

        "title": "Role of blood pressure monitoring in non-pharmacological management of hypertension",
        "abstract": "Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure (BP) measurement appear to be useful in the assessment of the effects of non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension because they can detect small changes in BP without observer bias. We studied the effects of various lifestyle modifications using ABPM and home BP measurement in Japanese patients with hypertension. Weight reduction by a hypocaloric diet (average 4\u2009kg) was associated with decreases in 24-h BP (10/4\u2009mmHg) as well as casual BP (9/6\u2009mmHg). The reductions in daytime and night-time BPs were comparable. The effects of daily walking without weight loss on office, home, and 24-h BPs were 2\u20133/1\u20132\u2009mmHg. The changes in home and 24-h BPs were more significant than those in office BP. A low-salt diet (25\u2009mmol/day versus 250\u2009mmol/day) decreased 24-h BP by 9/4\u2009mmHg. This hypotensive effect was observed throughout the day. Potassium supplementation (64\u2009mmol/day) decreased office, home and 24-h BPs by 3\u20134/1\u20132\u2009mmHg. The changes in home and 24-h BPs were highly significant compared with office BP. Supplementation of magnesium (20\u2009mmol/day) also reduced those BPs significantly. However, the effects of calcium supplementation (25\u2009mmol/day) were small (1\u20132/1\u2009mmHg) and were significant only for home BP. Alcohol restriction for 4 weeks decreased daytime BP by 3/2\u2009mmHg but increased night-time BP by 4/2\u2009mmHg. Average 24-h BP did not change. Smoking cessation lowered daytime BP without affecting night-time BP. Monitoring of 24-h BP and home BP can detect small changes in BP produced by lifestyle modifications. Ambulatory BP monitoring is particularly suitable in the assessment of changes in lifestyle affecting the circadian pattern of BP such as alcohol consumption and smoking.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDietary factors directly influence blood pressure (BP). The lactotripeptides (LTPs) IPP (isoleucine-proline-proline) and VPP (valine-proline-proline), formed by hydrolyzing dairy proteins, and potassium, a mineral mainly found in fruit, vegetables, and dairy products, are extensively studied for their BP-lowering effect. The efficacy of LTPs seems modest in whites compared with that in Asians.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective was to study the effects of enzymatically produced LTPs alone or in combination with potassium on ambulatory BP in whites.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwo multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover studies were conducted; each consisted of two 4-wk intervention periods separated by a 4-wk washout period. In study 1, 69 subjects received 200 g/d of a dairy drink with 5.8 mg IPP and 4.4 mg VPP or placebo. In study 2, 93 subjects received 100 g/d of a dairy drink with 2.7 mg IPP, 1.9 mg VPP, and 350 mg added K or placebo. The subjects were randomly assigned according to their daytime ambulatory BP.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean 24-h systolic and diastolic BP (baseline values-study 1: 137.1/81.6 mm Hg; study 2: 139.2/80.9 mm Hg) remained similar with no significant differences between treatments in either study (P > 0.10). Office BP decreased over the course of both studies (systolic BP > 5 mm Hg), but differences between interventions were not significant (P > 0.10). In both studies, nighttime BP dipped during all treatments (> or =15%) but was statistically more significant with placebo (P < 0.05). Sodium excretion increased significantly after consumption of LTPs and potassium compared with after placebo intervention (P = 0.01), but not after consumption of LTPs alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe data do not support a BP-lowering effect of LTPs in whites.",

        "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on EstroG-100 as a novel food (NF) submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The NF is EstroG-100, a hot-water extract of a mixture of three herbal roots (Cynanchum wilfordii Hemsley, Phlomis umbrosa Turcz. and Angelica gigas Nakai), which is concentrated and spray-dried. The information provided on the composition, specifications and stability of the NF is sufficient, and does not raise safety concerns. The applicant intends to use EstroG-100 in food supplements, with a proposed maximum intake level of 514 mg/day. The target population is post-menopausal women. The Panel considers that the information provided does not raise safety concerns as regards the genotoxicity of the NF. The Panel considers that the no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) derived from the subchronic 90-day oral toxicity study with EstroG-100, which was supported by observations in other studies, is 500 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Taking into account the NOAEL and the proposed maximum intake level, the Panel considers that the margin of safety of 68 is not sufficient. Based on the absence of chronic toxicity data, increase in effects with exposure duration in toxicity studies, and the absence of investigations of liver parameters and haematology in human studies, the Panel applies the uncertainty factor of 200 to derive the maximum safe intake level for the NF. Thus, the Panel concludes that the NF, EstroG-100, is safe for the use in food supplements at the maximum intake level of 175 mg/day for an adult of 70 kg bw. \u00a9 2016 European Food Safety Authority.

        "abstract": "Bioactive peptides (BPs) are amino acid sequences derived from food proteins. Their relevance lies in the biological activities they have once they are released from the parent protein. BPs or protein hydrolysates can be commercialized as nutraceutical products or functional ingredients according to their activities. Different food protein sources have been researched for their potential to generate BPs. However, with the exception of lunasin (derived from soy), animal protein sources have been predominantly exploited as commercial BPs sources. On the other hand, pulses have shown diverse BP contents without further impact on their commercialization. Pulses are a rich source of protein in the human diet and their consumption has been associated with the prevention of chronic diseases. The beneficial effect in human health has been related to their micronutrients, phytochemical bioactive compounds, and recently BPs. This article reviews the current literature about pulse protein hydrolysates and BPs with proved angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory, antioxidant, cancer preventing, and other health promoting activities. Proteolysis process is commonly achieved by digestive and microorganism enzymes. BP purification and identification has consisted mainly on size segregation procedures followed by mass spectrometry techniques. Hydrolysis time, peptide size, and hydrophobicity are employed as process variants and structural features relevant for the BP activities. Finally, some considerations about industrial processing and BPs used as functional food ingredients were reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Bovine hemoglobin was selected for use in the generation of bioactive hydrolysates with potential for use as functional food ingredients for prevention of disorders such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes. Bovine hemoglobin was isolated and hydrolyzed with papain, which was selected using in silico analysis. The generated hydrolysate was enriched by ultrafiltration and further purified by high performance liquid chromatography. A number of peptides were identified using de novo peptide sequencing and these peptides were chemically synthesized to confirm their bioactivity in vitro. Three multifunctional peptides with both, ACE-I and renin-inhibitory properties and one peptide with ACE-I-inhibiting properties were identified. These included the di-peptide HR with ACE-I and renin IC50 values of 0.19 and 7.09 mM, respectively. The generated papain hydrolysate of bovine hemoglobin not only inhibited the enzymes ACE-I and renin but also the enzyme DPP-IV, which has been linked to type-2 diabetes. \n \nPractical Applications \nSlaughterhouse blood represents a problematic coproduct to meat processors due to the large volumes generated and its high pollutant load, and it is usually discarded as waste or used for low value purposes such as blood meal.

To find potential applications for this largely underutilized coproduct, the ACE-I, renin and DPP-IV inhibitory properties of a papain hydrolysate of bovine hemoglobin were studied and a number of novel multifunctional bioactive hydrolysates and peptides were identified. Results obtained herein may not only reduce blood disposal but also have a role in improving public health.

        "abstract": "Renin catalyzes the rate-determining step in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates mammalian blood pressure by converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). Excessive plasma levels of Ang I is a causative factor in hypertension development. Therefore, inhibition of renin activity can lower blood pressure and provide relief from clinical symptoms associated with hypertension. Synthetic compounds are currently the most used group of renin inhibitors; however, only aliskiren is approved as a drug for hypertension treatment. But some negative side effects are associated with aliskiren therapy, which have necessitated the search for alternative natural compounds such as food protein-derived renin-inhibitory peptides with blood pressure-reducing effects. This paper is a concise review of the currently known sources and methods of production of renin-inhibitory peptides including their potential in vitro and in vivo extent of renin inhibition. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Hypertension is a major human chronic disease that leads to severe cardiovascular impairment and ultimately death if not managed properly. Current therapeutic approach to hypertension management involves the use of drugs that inhibit excessive activities of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), the two main enzymes that control mammalian blood pressure. Since renin catalyzes a single reaction that is the rate-determining step in the renin-angiotensin system, inhibition of this enzyme activity could be a highly effective strategy for controlling blood pressure without severe negative side effects. However, therapeutic control of renin activity remains difficult with only one approved drug. Some food protein-derived peptides have been found to inhibit renin activity inhibition, which could offer a drug-free treatment for hypertension. Therefore, this review provides a summary of recent developments in the advances and efficacy testing of renin-inhibitory peptides.",

        "abstract": "Bioactive peptides from plant protein sources have been continuously identified as nutrient supplements for low toxicity but multiple physiological activities such as antihypertensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10\u00a0kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) higher for the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction (84.25%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.45%, 75.19%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and\u00a0>1\u00a0kDa fractions. The\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction also showed significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) higher oxygen radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.45 (\u03bcM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the\u00a0>1\u00a0kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100\u00a0mg/kg body weight) of the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35\u00a0mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20\u00a0mmHg) after 6\u00a0hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction showing high oxygen radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially\u00a0<1\u00a0kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Oligopeptides exhibit great prospects for clinical application and its separation is of great importance in new drug development. Methods: To accurately predict the retention of pentapeptides with analogous structures in chromatography, the retention times of 57 pentapeptide derivatives in seven buffers at three temperatures and four mobile phase compositions were measured via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The parameters ( k H A , k A , and p K a ) of the acid\u2013base equilibrium were obtained by fitting the data corresponding to a sigmoidal function. We then studied the dependence of these parameters on the temperature (T), organic modifier composition (\u03c6, methanol volume fraction), and polarity ( P m N parameter). Finally, we proposed two six-parameter models with (1) pH and T and (2) pH and \u03c6 or P m N as the independent variables. These models were validated for their prediction capacities by linearly fitting the predicted retention factor k-value and the experimental k-value. Results: The results showed that log k H A and log k A exhibited linear relationships with 1 / T , \u03c6 or P m N for all pentapeptides, especially for the acid pentapeptides. In the model of pH and T, the correlation coefficient (R2) of the acid pentapeptides was 0.8603, suggesting a certain prediction capability of chromatographic retention. Moreover, in the model of pH and \u03c6 or P m N , the R2 values of the acid and neutral pentapeptides were greater than 0.93, and the average root mean squared error was approximately 0.3, indicating that the k-values could be effectively predicted. Discussion: In summary, the two six-parameter models were appropriate to characterize the chromatographic retention of amphoteric compounds, especially the acid or neutral pentapeptides, and could predict the chromatographic retention of pentapeptide compounds.

It also elevated HDL-C levels by 1.2 fold and reduced serum ALT by 37.94% and AST by 31.21% in mice fed a HFD. These changes contributed to the reduction in hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation. Additionally, PA improved insulin resistance and inhibited hepatic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Mechanistic studies revealed that PA alleviated lipid accumulation in HFD-induced NAFLD by activating the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 and ACC, inhibiting the expression of SREBF1 and FASN to reduce hepatic lipogenesis, and increasing the expression of ATGL, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 to promote lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. These results indicate that PA could serve as a dietary supplement for alleviating NAFLD, offering a theoretical foundation for the rational intake of PA in NAFLD intervention.",
