        "abstract": "In a randomized, double blind, multicentre study with 4 weeks follow-up of 290 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee joint, a topical NSAID (eltenac) was compared with oral diclofenac and placebo. The main outcome, Lequesne's Index and pain by VAS showed no statistically significant differences between neither of the active treatments and placebo for the total study population. However, in patients with more severe symptoms, both active groups showed statistically significant differences to placebo. No severe adverse drug reactions were seen but the number of GI reactions were three times higher in the diclofenac group compared to the topical treatment. Local skin reactions were twice as frequent in the eltenac than in the placebo group. Taking into account the nature of the treatment for a chronic disease like OA, our results indicate that eltenac gel could be a safe alternative to oral NSAIDs.",

        "title": "Oral versus topical NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases: a comparison.",
        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and are responsible for approximately one-quarter of all adverse drug reaction reports. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for patients with rheumatic disease--a population at increased risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Topical administration of NSAIDs offers the advantage of local, enhanced drug delivery to affected tissues with a reduced incidence of systemic adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease and GI haemorrhage. NSAIDs administered topically penetrate slowly and in small quantities into the systemic circulation; bioavailability and maximal plasma NSAID concentration after topical application are generally less than 5 and 15%, respectively, compared with equivalent oral administration. Product formulation may have a dramatic impact, not only on absorption rates but also on penetration depth. Compared with oral administration, topical application leads to relatively high NSAID concentrations in the dermis. Concentrations achieved in the muscle tissue below the site of application are variable, but are at least equivalent to that obtained with oral administration. NSAIDs applied topically do reach the synovial fluid, but the extent and mechanism (topical penetration versus distribution via the systemic circulation) remain to be determined. In addition, marked interindividual variability was noted in all studies; percutaneous absorption may be strongly influenced by individual skin properties. In general, interpretation of clinical studies measuring efficacy of topical NSAIDs in rheumatic disease states is difficult because of a remarkably high placebo response rate, use of rescue paracetamol (acetaminophen), and significant variability in percutaneous absorption and response rates between patients. Overall efficacy rates attributable to topical NSAIDs in patients with rheumatic disorders ranged from 18 to 92% of treated patients. Topically applied NSAIDs have a superior safety profile to oral formulations. Adverse effects secondary to topical NSAID application occur in approximately 10 to 15% of patients and are primarily cutaneous in nature (rash and pruritus at site of application). GI adverse drug reactions are rare with topically applied NSAIDs, compared with a 15% incidence reported for oral NSAIDs. Available clinical studies suggest, but do not document, equivalent efficacy of topical over oral NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases.",

        "abstract": "The mammalian skin has long been considered to be poor in drug metabolism. However, many reports clearly show that most drug metabolizing enzymes also occur in the mammalian skin albeit at relatively low specific activities. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on drug metabolizing enzymes in the skin of human, rat, and pig, the latter, because it is often taken as a model for human skin on grounds of anatomical similarities. However only little is known about drug metabolizing enzymes in pig skin. Interestingly, some cytochromes P450 (CYP) have been observed in the rat skin which are not expressed in the rat liver, such as CYP 2B12 and CYP2D4. As far as investigated most drug metabolizing enzymes occur in the suprabasal (i.e. differentiating) layers of the epidermis, but the rat CYP1A1 rather in the basal layer and human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase rather in the stratum corneum. The pattern of drug metabolizing enzymes and their localization will impact not only the beneficial as well as detrimental properties of drugs for the skin but also dictate whether a drug reaches the blood flow unchanged or as activated or inactivated metabolite(s).",

        "abstract": "The use of a prodrug, a conjugate of an active drug with a lipophilic substituent, is a good way of increasing the cutaneous absorption of a drug. However, the activity of dermal hydrolases has rarely been investigated in humans, or experimental animals. In the present study, we focused on the identification of rat dermal esterases and the hydrolysis of a prodrug during permeation across rat skin. We found that carboxylesterase (CES), especially the rat CES1 isozyme, Hydrolase A, is expressed in rat skin and that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acyl derivatives and caproyl-propranolol (PL) was 20-fold lower in the 9000g supernatant fraction of skin homogenate than in liver microsomes. A permeation study of caproyl-PL was performed in rat full-thickness and stripped skin using a flow-through diffusion cell. Caproyl-PL was easily partitioned into the stratum corneum and retained, not only in the stratum corneum, but also in viable epidermis and dermis. Caproyl-PL could barely be detected in the receptor fluid after application to either full-thickness or stripped skin. PL, derived from caproyl-PL, was, however, detected in receptor fluid after extensive hydrolysis of caproyl-PL in viable skin. Permeation of PL was markedly decreased under CES inhibition, indicating that the net flux of caproyl-PL is dependent on its conversion rate to PL.",

        "title": "Interspecies Differences in the Metabolism of a Multiester Prodrug by Carboxylesterases.",
        "abstract": "The pentaethyl ester prodrug of the chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) referred to as C2E5 is being developed as an orally bioavailable radionuclide decorporation agent. The predicted human efficacy obtained in these experimental animals is confounded by interspecies variations of metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, carboxylesterase-mediated metabolism of [(14)C]-C2E5 was compared in the S9 intestinal and hepatic fractions of human, dog, and rat and their respective plasma. Intestinal hydrolysis of C2E5, resulting in the formation of the tetraethyl ester of DTPA (C2E4), was only detected in human and rat. The primary metabolite in human and dog hepatic fractions was C2E4, whereas the predominant species identified in rat hepatic fractions was the triethyl ester (C2E3). Hepatic hydrolysis of C2E5 causes the formation of C2E4 in human, dog, and rat and C2E3 in rat only. Minimal C2E5 hydrolysis was observed in human and dog plasma, whereas in rat plasma C2E5 converted to C2E3 rapidly, followed by slower further metabolism. Both recombinant CES1 and CES2 play roles in C2E5 metabolism. Together, these data suggest that dogs may be the most appropriate species for predicting human C2E5 metabolism, whereas rats might be useful for clarifying the potential toxicity of C2E5 metabolites.",

        "abstract": "6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) is a glutamine antagonist with robust anticancer efficacy; however, its therapeutic potential was hampered by its biodistribution and toxicity to normal tissues, specifically gastrointestinal (GI) tissues. To circumvent DON's toxicity, we synthesized a series of tumor-targeted DON prodrugs designed to circulate inert in plasma and preferentially activate over DON in tumor. Our best prodrug 6 (isopropyl 2-(6-acetamido-2-(adamantane-1-carboxamido)hexanamido)-6-diazo-5-oxohexanoate) showed stability in plasma, liver, and intestinal homogenates yet was readily cleaved to DON in P493B lymphoma cells, exhibiting a 55-fold enhanced tumor cell-to-plasma ratio versus that of DON and resulting in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Using carboxylesterase 1 knockout mice that were shown to mimic human prodrug metabolism, systemic administration of 6 delivered 11-fold higher DON exposure to tumor (target tissue; AUC0- t = 5.1 nmol h/g) versus GI tissues (toxicity tissue; AUC0- t = 0.45 nmol h/g). In summary, these studies describe the discovery of a glutamine antagonist prodrug that provides selective tumor exposure.",

        "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Amplification of c-MYC is a hallmark of a subset of poor-prognosis medulloblastoma. MYC upregulates glutamine metabolism across many types of cancer. We modified the naturally occurring glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) by adding 2 promoeities to increase its lipophilicity and brain penetration creating the prodrug isopropyl 6-diazo-5-oxo-2-(((phenyl (pivaloyloxy) methoxy) - carbonyl) amino) hexanoate, termed JHU395. This prodrug was shown to have a 10-fold improved CSF-to-plasma ratio and brain-to-plasma ratio relative to DON. We hypothesized that JHU395 would have superior cell penetration compared with DON and would effectively and more potently kill MYC-expressing medulloblastoma. JHU395 treatment caused decreased growth and increased apoptosis in multiple human high-MYC medulloblastoma cell lines at lower concentrations than DON. Parenteral administration of JHU395 in Nu/Nu mice led to the accumulation of micromolar concentrations of DON in brain. Treatment of mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of human MYC-amplified medulloblastoma with JHU395 increased median survival from 26 to 45\u2009days compared with vehicle control mice (p\u2009<\u20090.001 by log-rank test). These data provide preclinical justification for the ongoing development and testing of brain-targeted DON prodrugs for use in medulloblastoma.",

        "title": "Glutamine mimicry suppresses tumor progression through asparagine metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma",
        "abstract": "In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), glutamine is a critical nutrient that drives a wide array of metabolic and biosynthetic processes that support tumor growth. Despite this established dependency, the targeting of specific enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism is yet to yield any clinical benefit. Here, we have examined the therapeutic potential of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine antagonist that broadly inhibits glutamine metabolism. We found that DON treatment significantly blocks PDAC tumor growth and attenuates metastasis. Interestingly, we link the effectiveness of DON in PDAC to asparagine (Asn) metabolism. By inhibiting asparagine synthetase (ASNS), DON significantly reduces intracellular Asn production and Asn supplementation rescues the anti-proliferative effects of DON. We discern that PDAC cells upregulate expression of ASNS as a metabolic adaptation and that modulating ASNS levels can impact DON efficacy. Strikingly, in patient-derived organoids, DON responsiveness is inversely correlated with ASNS expression, a feature that is not observed for other metabolic enzymes targeted by DON. We find that treatment with L-asparaginase (ASNase), an enzyme that catabolizes free Asn, synergizes with DON to impact the viability of PDAC cells. Finally, we identify that a combination therapy of DON and ASNase has a significant impact on metastasis. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive the effects of glutamine mimicry and point to the utility of co-targeting adaptive responses to control PDAC progression.",

        "abstract": "Overcoming acquired resistance to Osimertinib remains a critical challenge in treating NSCLC. This research indicates that Osimertinib-resistant cells exhibit a strong dependence on glutamine metabolism. However, targeting GLS1 shows limited anticancer effects, probably because it cannot fully block the glutamine metabolic pathway. The investigation reveals that a more effective strategy involves simultaneously inhibiting both ASCT2 and GLS1. After confirming the efficacy of this dual-targeting approach against Osimertinib-resistant cells in preclinical models, the potential of utilizing a broad-spectrum glutamine metabolism antagonist is further explored to achieve superior antitumor efficacy. DON, broad-spectrum glutamine antagonist, presents toxicity issues. Herein, the high NQO1 expression in Osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells is leveraged to design an NQO1-responsive DON prodrug, 10e (LBJ-10e). This prodrug demonstrates superior safety compared to natural DON and greater antitumor activity against resistant tumors compared to the clinical phase II drug DRP104. These findings may address the clinical limitations of GLS1 allosteric inhibitors and underscore prodrug strategies in effectively treating Osimertinib-resistant lung cancer, providing a foundation for future clinical trials.",
