Crossover data showed that improvement occurred in 26 of 39 courses of 6-MP (67%) as compared with three of 39 courses of placebo (8%) (P less than 0.001). Non-crossover data likewise confirmed the superiority of 6-MP. The drug was more effective than placebo in closing fistulas (31 vs 6%) and in permitting discontinuation or reduction of steroid dosage (75 vs. 36%) (P less than 0.001). The onset of response to 6-MP was often delayed, with 32% of patients taking longer than three months to respond, and 19% taking longer than four months. Adverse side effects to 6-MP occurred in 10% of patients and were uniformly reversible. We conclude that 6-MP is an effective and useful agent in the management of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "EXTERNAL fistulas are a characteristic of Crohn\u2018s disease, occurring in I S -20 per cent of patients ( I . 2). They usually pass through the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. I ) but they can surface in the perineum or on the buttocks. In most instances the amount of discharge of pus and faeces from the fistula is small and some patients cope with it by wearing dressings rather than a bag. Nevertheless, it is often sufficient in quantity to cause sore skin and to soil clothing. Many of these patients have already undergone operations which have failed to control or have even provoked the fistula. Others have been told that their problem is not amenable to surgical treatment. a belief still held by some physicians and an occasional surgeon. and which is just not true. Virtually all external fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease can be successfully closed as long as certain basic rules are followed. However, it has to be admitted that an occasional fistula defies closure. and in others refistulation from a different site somctimes occurs. External fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease are of two types. Type I fistulas are those that arise from a segment of bowel, often the terminal ileum, involved by active disease. The inflamed bowel becomes attached to the abdominal wall which itself becomes inflamed and the site of abscess formation. The point of attachment is often in the right iliac fossa (Fig. I ) or to the inside of a laparotomy scar, especially when this has been recently performed (Fig. 2 ) . Such fistulas form following spontaneous or induced drainage of an abscess pointing on the abdominal surface. Type 1 fistulas nearly always require operation to close them. Tipe 2 fistulas are those that follow breakdown of an anastomosis undertaken following resection of bowel involved with Crohn\u2019s disease. Most fistulas of this type. given correct treatment, will heal spontaneously. In this respect their management differs fundamentally from type 1 fistulas.",

        "abstract": "Fifty\u2010two patients with Crohn's disease have been assessed using acute phase proteins and a scoring system. Thirty\u2010nine underwent operation and intra\u2010abdominal abscesses were found in seventeen. Both scores and acute phase proteins have been shown to reflect inflammation due to secondary sepsis in addition to that from active Crohn's disease. The scores were higher, and acute phase changes greater, in patients with sepsis than those without. By choosing a threshold for each variable that excludes patients without sepsis it has been found that a score > 181, ESR >45 mm/h, CRP >33 mg/l, orosomucoid >1.8g/l and albumin < 26.7 g/l identify sepsis with a specificity >95 per cent and sensitivity > 35 per cent. Over 70 per cent of patients with abscesses exceeded one or more of these thresholds. We believe that operative management should be strongly considered if one or more of these criteria are positive as such patients have a greater than 90 per cent chance of having an intra\u2010abdominal abscess. This will prevent these abscesses eroding into adjacent viscera or to the surface with resulting fistula formation.",

The serum concentrations of serum amyloid A protein (SAA), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1\u2010antichymotrypsin (alpha 1\u2010ACT) and alpha 1\u2010acid glycoprotein (alpha 1\u2010AGP) have been measured in eighty\u2010six patients with Crohn's disease, twenty\u2010five patients with ulcerative colitis and twenty\u2010two patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. In the Crohn's and ulcerative colitis group significant increases in concentration were observed in all four proteins, which parallelled disease severity as defined by other conventional laboratory parameters formulated into a simple activity index. In the irritable bowel group no significant changes were seen. Serum amyloid A and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease when mild, but did not differ significantly when severe. Serum amyloid A correlated well with CRP (r= 0\u00b783) and alpha 1\u2010ACT (r= 0\u00b780), but less well with alpha 1\u2010AGP (r= 0\u00b765). Serum amyloid A was the most sensitive protein (77%) but had the lowest specificity (74%). C\u2010reactive protein was less sensitive (58%) than SAA but had greater specificity (100%). Alpha 1\u2010ACT had a sensitivity and specificity similar to CRP and, therefore, provided little or no additional information. Alpha 1\u2010AGP, although also 100% specific, had the lowest sensitivity (34%) and, therefore, is probably the least useful acute phase monitor of inflammatory bowel disease. The role, and associated problems, of SAA measurements are discussed.",

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 of these patients to generate soluble interleukin-2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations of patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 19) were significantly elevated (757 +/- 438 U/ml) compared with levels in patients with inactive disease (n = 10; 412 +/- 120 U/ml) and healthy control individuals (n = 40; 375 +/- 102 U/ml; p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). Serial determinations of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration in a follow-up of 11 hospitalized patients treated for highly active disease showed a decrease from 1252 +/- 494 U/ml to 527 +/- 193 U/ml (p less than 0.004) that corresponded to clinical improvement, as assessed by Crohn's disease activity index and a reduction of inflammatory parameters. In vitro phytohemagglutinin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn's disease resulted in elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor production not only in patients with active disease (3987 +/- 2439 U/ml), but also in patients with inactive disease (3297 +/- 2282 U/ml), compared with the amount of soluble interleukin-2 receptor produced by mononuclear cells of healthy individuals (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, cultivation of mononuclear cells without mitogen resulted in higher soluble interleukin-2 receptor production in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.02). However, patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis also had significantly increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (1080 +/- 400 U/ml) compared with the levels in patients with chronic disease (455 +/- 140 U/ml; p less than 0.0025). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with ulcerative colitis produced significantly more soluble interleukin-2 receptor upon mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (2314 +/- 936 U/ml), than cells from healthy controls (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.05). The finding of elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels in patients with active Crohn's disease and its increased production by mononuclear cells of patients with both active and inactive disease is a further example of an alteration of the immune system in this condition; however, this alteration can also be found in other inflammatory bowel diseases.",

This is thought to occur as a consequence of regulatory influences which are exerted by the mucosal microenvironment. The present study is aimed at investigating whether proliferative responses of intestinal LPL\u2010T to antigen receptor stimulation are altered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, proliferative responses of LPL\u2010T in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis to stimulation with CD3 MoAb plus IL\u20102 were examined and compared with controls. In addition, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of LPL\u2010T and peripheral blood T lymphocytes were determined by indirect immunofluorescenee using a panel of 11 TCR V\u03b2 specific antibodies. In most patients with inflammatory bowel disease, LPL\u2010T showed enhanced proliferation to antigen receptor stimulation compared with controls. Moreover, perhaps as a consequence, an enhanced frequency of in vivo preactivated T cells was seen as judged from an increased spontaneous proliferative response to low concentrations of exogenous IL\u20102. LPL\u2010T and peripheral blood T lymphocytes exhibited similar percentages of TCR V\u03b2 gene usage both in controls and in patients. In summary, polyclonal activation of LPL\u2010T due to impairment of local adjustment, i.e. insufficient down\u2010regulation of TCR/CD3\u2010dependent signalling processes, may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral lung tissue contains large numbers of T cells, strategically located for immune surveillance at the blood\u2013air interface. Given the intensity of antigenic exposure at this site, it is clear that local T\u2010cell activation events require strict control, in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. How this control is achieved in this unique tissue microenvironment is unknown, and the present study sought to elucidate the process via detailed analysis of the surface phenotypic characteristics of freshly isolated lung T cells. We report below that these cells display typical characteristic of \u2018postactivation\u2019, notably elevated basal Ca2+ concentrations, down\u2010modulated T\u2010cell receptors, expression of Ia and \u2018late\u2019 activation antigens and concomitant CD4/CD8. However, levels of interleukin\u20102 receptor and CD2 expression were below those expected of \u2018activated\u2019 T\u2010cell populations, and virtually all of the cells were found to be in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle.

        "abstract": "Summary: Experimental data indicate that mucosal CD4+ T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Based on the pattern of cytokine production, CD4+ T cells may be distinguished into two different phenotypes. Th1 responses are characterized by secretion of interleukin (IL)\u20102, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr;, lymphotoxin, and interferon (IFN)\u2010&ggr; and are associated with delayedtype hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Th2 responses, which are characterized by secretion of IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010, have been associated with humoral immune responses and allergy. To assess the number of IFN\u2010&agr; and IL\u20104 positive cells in IBD and normal intestinal specimens, frozen sections from intestinal specimens from 10 Crohn's disease (CD), 8 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 healthy controls were examined by immunohistochemistry. Monoclonal antibodies for CD3, CD8, IFN\u2010&ggr;, and IL\u20104 were used. T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration and cytokine expression by epithelial, lamina propria, and submucosal cells were scored on a four\u2010point scale by two independent observers who were blinded for the clinical data. One\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was used for statistical analysis. In intestinal specimens from IBD patients, the number of CD3+ cells was found increased in the lamina propria and, within the submucosa, this increase was significant (p < 0.001). In CD the number of lamina propria IFN\u2010&ggr; positive cells was significantly increased as compared with controls (p < 0.002). In UC the number of both IFN\u2010&ggr; and IL\u20104 producing cells in the lamina propria was not significantly increased as compared with controls.

However, the factors regulating crypt cell growth in pathological conditionsare not fully understood. We report here that the endogenously produced chemokine CXCL10 regulates crypt cell proliferation. CXCL10 was constitutively expressed by basal crypts in mouse colon, but the expression of CXCL10 as well as CXCR3 was enhanced in the epithelium in the proliferative zone after oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium. Neutralization of CXCL10 protected mice from epithelial ulceration by promoting crypt cell survival without evidence of altered immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, recombinant CXCL10 administration into mice inhibited intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. These findings suggest that CXCL10 regulates crypt cell growth to maintain intestinal homeostasis in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Thus, CXCL10 can be a new therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease by controlling the dynamics of epithelial homeostasis.",

        "title": "Dysregulation of CXCR3 Signaling due to CXCL10 Deficiency Impairs the Antiviral Response to Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Infection1",
        "abstract": "The chemokine, CXCL10, chemotactic for NK cells, activated T cells, and dendritic cells is highly expressed during viral infections, including HSV-1. The importance of this chemokine to the control of HSV-1 infection was tested using mice deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10\u2212/\u2212). Following corneal infection, HSV-1 viral titers were elevated in the nervous system of CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment including dendritic cells, NK cells, and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain stem. In the absence of NK cells and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in wild-type (WT) or CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, similar levels of virus were recovered in the nervous system, suggesting these cells are responsible for the observed defects in the control of viral replication in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Leukocyte mobilization was also compared between WT, CXCL10\u2212/\u2212, and mice deficient in the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212). NK cell mobilization was comparably reduced in both CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 and CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to WT animals. However, the reduction in mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 was not observed in CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice following HSV-1 infection. The defect was not the result of an alternative receptor for CXCL10, as Ag-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment was not reduced in mice which were deficient in both CXCL10 and CXCR3. Thus, CXCL10 deficiency results in reduced mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells as a result of dysregulation of CXCR3 signaling.",

        "title": "Differential Gene Expression Patterns of EBV Infected EBNA-3A Positive and Negative Human B Lymphocytes",
        "abstract": "The genome of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes 86 proteins, but only a limited set is expressed in EBV\u2013growth transformed B cells, termed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). These cells proliferate via the concerted action of EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and latent membrane proteins (LMPs), some of which are rate limiting to establish a stable homeostasis of growth promoting and anti-apoptotic activities. We show here that EBV mutants, which lack the EBNA-3A gene, are impaired but can still initiate cell cycle entry and proliferation of primary human B cells in contrast to an EBNA-2 deficient mutant virus. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous reports, these viral mutants are attenuated in growth transformation assays but give rise to permanently growing EBNA-3A negative B cell lines which exhibit reduced proliferation rates and elevated levels of apoptosis. Expression profiles of EBNA-3A deficient LCLs are characterized by 129 down-regulated and 167 up-regulated genes, which are significantly enriched for genes involved in apoptotic processes or cell cycle progression like the tumor suppressor gene p16/INK4A, or might contribute to essential steps of the viral life cycle in the infected host. In addition, EBNA-3A cellular target genes remarkably overlap with previously identified targets of EBNA-2. This study comprises the first genome wide expression profiles of EBNA-3A target genes generated within the complex network of viral proteins of the growth transformed B cell and permits a more detailed understanding of EBNA-3A's function and contribution to viral pathogenesis.",

        "title": "Innate immune response to influenza A virus in differentiated human alveolar type II cells.",
        "abstract": "Alveolar Type II (ATII) cells are important targets for seasonal and pandemic influenza. To investigate the influenza-induced innate immune response in those cells, we measured the global gene expression profile of highly differentiated ATII cells infected with the influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 at 4 hours and 24 hours after inoculation. Infection with influenza stimulated a significant increase in the mRNA concentrations of many host defense-related genes, including pattern/pathogen recognition receptors, IFN, and IFN-induced genes, chemokines, and suppressors of cytokine signaling. We verified these changes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At the protein level, we detected a robust virus-induced secretion of the three glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR)-negative chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, according to ELISA. The ultraviolet inactivation of virus abolished the chemokine and cytokine response. Viral infection did not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, as measured by cellular mRNA and concentrations of surfactant proteins. However, viral infection significantly reduced the secretion of surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D. In addition, influenza A virus triggered a time-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in ATII cells. The inhibition of this pathway significantly decreased the release of infectious virus and the chemokine response, but did not alter virus-induced cell death. This study provides insights into influenza-induced innate immunity in differentiated human ATII cells, and demonstrates that the alveolar epithelium is a critical part of the initial innate immune response to influenza.",

        "title": "CD8+ T Cells Produce the Chemokine CXCL10 in Response to CD27/CD70 Costimulation To Promote Generation of the CD8+ Effector T Cell Pool",
        "abstract": "Various cell types can produce the chemokine CXCL10 in response to IFN-\u03b3 stimulation. CXCL10 is generally viewed as a proinflammatory chemokine that promotes recruitment of CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ effector T cells to infected or inflamed nonlymphoid tissues. We show that CXCL10 plays a role during CD8+ T cell priming in the mouse. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed the Cxcl10 gene as a target of CD27/CD70 costimulation in newly activated CD8+ T cells. CD27/CD70 costimulation is known to promote activated T cell survival, but CXCL10 did not affect survival or proliferation of primed CD8+ T cells in vitro. Accordingly, CXCL10 could not fully rescue CD27 deficiency in mice infected with influenza virus. Rather, CXCL10 acted as chemoattractant for other activated CD8+ T cells. It signaled downstream of CD27 in a paracrine fashion to promote generation of the CD8+ effector T cell pool in the Ag-draining lymph nodes. Consistently, CD8+ T cells required expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 for their clonal expansion in a CD27/CD70-dependent peptide-immunization model. Our findings indicate that CXCL10, produced by primed CD8+ T cells in response to CD27/CD70 costimulation, signals to other primed CD8+ T cells in the lymph node microenvironment to facilitate their participation in the CD8+ effector T cell pool.",

        "title": "CXCL10 Triggers Early Microglial Activation in the Cuprizone Model",
        "abstract": "A broad spectrum of diseases is characterized by myelin abnormalities and/or oligodendrocyte pathology. In most, if not all, of these diseases, early activation of microglia occurs. Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering early microglia activation is, however, incomplete. In this study, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the temporal and causal relationship of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and early microglia activation. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed the induction of distinct chemokines, among them Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Early microglia activation was unchanged in CCL2- and CCL3-deficient knockouts, but was significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice, resulting in an amelioration of cuprizone toxicity at later time points. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that recombinant CXCL10 induced migration and a proinflammatory phenotype in cultured microglia, without affecting their phagocytic activity or proliferation. In situ hybridization analyses suggest that Cxcl10 mRNA is mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also oligodendrocytes, in short-term cuprizone-exposed mice. Our results show that CXCL10 actively participates in the initiation of microglial activation. These findings have implications for the role of CXCL10 as an important mediator during the initiation of neuroinflammatory processes associated with oligodendrocyte pathology.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress critically contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Astrocytes are the main regulators of oxidative homeostasis in the brain and dysregulation of these cells likely contributes to the accumulation of oxidative damage. The nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2010related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the main transcriptional regulator of the anti\u2010oxidant stress defense. In this study, we elucidate the effects of astrocytic Nrf2\u2010activation on brain\u2010intrinsic inflammation and lesion development. Cells deficient for the Nrf2 repressor kelch\u2010like ECH\u2010associated protein 1 (Keap1) are characterized by hyperactivation of Nrf2\u2010signaling. Therefore, wild type mice and mice with a GFAP\u2010specific Keap1\u2010deletion were fed with 0.25% cuprizone for 1 or 3 weeks. Cuprizone intoxication induced pronounced oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination and reactive gliosis in wild type animals. In contrast, astrocyte\u2010specific Nrf2\u2010activation was sufficient to prevent oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination, to ameliorate brain intrinsic inflammation and to counteract axonal damage. Our results highlight the potential of the Nrf2/ARE system for the treatment of neuroinflammation in general and of multiple sclerosis in particular. \u00a9 GLIA 2016;64:2219\u20132230",

        "abstract": "The potential of autologous cell\u2010based therapies including those using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is being investigated for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological conditions. However, the phenotype of MSC in neurological diseases has not been fully characterized. We have previously shown that MSC isolated from patients with progressive MS (MS\u2010MSC) have reduced expansion potential, premature senescence, and reduced neuroprotective potential in vitro. In view of the role of antioxidants in ageing and neuroprotection, we examined the antioxidant capacity of MS\u2010MSC demonstrating that MS\u2010MSC secretion of antioxidants superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione S\u2010transferase P (GSTP) is reduced and correlates negatively with the duration of progressive phase of MS. We confirmed reduced expression of SOD1 and GSTP by MS\u2010MSC along with reduced activity of SOD and GST and, to examine the antioxidant capacity of MS\u2010MSC under conditions of nitrosative stress, we established an in vitro cell survival assay using nitric oxide\u2010induced cell death. MS\u2010MSC displayed differential susceptibility to nitrosative stress with accelerated senescence and greater decline in expression of SOD1 and GSTP in keeping with reduced expression of master regulators of antioxidant responses nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2010related factor 2 and peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor gamma coactivator 1\u2010\u03b1. Our results are compatible with dysregulation of antioxidant responses in MS\u2010MSC and have significant implications for development of autologous MSC\u2010based therapies for MS, optimization of which may require that these functional deficits are reversed.
