        "abstract": "Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of a worksite health promotion programme by individual counselling on sick leave. Methods: Three municipal services of Enschede, the Netherlands, participated in this trial. A total of 299 civil servants were measured at baseline and were randomised by cluster into the intervention (n\u200a=\u200a131) or the control group (n\u200a=\u200a168). During nine months, subjects in the intervention group received a total of seven consultations, particularly aimed at increasing their physical activity level and improving their dietary habits. Both the intervention and the control subjects received written information as to several lifestyle factors. Sick leave data regarding the nine month intervention period (from May until January) were collected from each municipal service\u2019s personnel department. In addition, sick leave data concerning the nine month period pre- and post-intervention were collected. Sick leave data were analysed using multilevel analysis. Results: For both groups, the mean sick leave rate during the intervention increased compared to before the intervention. After the intervention period, the control group increased even more (from 22.9 to 27.6 days), whereas the intervention group slightly decreased (from 21.5 to 20.5 days). Median values of sick leave rate decreased for both groups. No statistically significant intervention effect was found. In both groups, the mean sick leave frequency slightly decreased over time (intervention effects were not significant). Conclusions: Results showed no significant effect of individual counselling on sick leave. Continued research investigating the effectiveness of this individual counselling programme on several health related outcomes is useful to clarify the trend observed in sick leave.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the dose\u2013response relation between moderate and vigorous physical activity and sick leave in a working population. Methods: Data were used from three large Dutch databases: two continuous, cross sectional surveys among a representative sample of the Dutch population and one prospective cohort study. A distinction was made between duration, frequency and intensity of physical activity. The outcome measure was the number of days of sick leave. Analyses of variance were used to compare sick leave (in days) for workers with different amounts of physical activity, in particular workers meeting the physical activity recommendations v those who did not. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to obtain effect estimates in the prospective cohort study, with the generalised estimating equation (GEE) method. Results: No relation was found between moderate physical activity and sick leave. In two databases, workers meeting the recommendation of vigorous physical activity (active at a vigorous level for at least three times a week) had significantly less sick leave: more than one day over two months and more than four days over a year. The duration of vigorous physical activity was not associated with sick leave. Conclusion: Physical activity at a vigorous intensity level for at least three times a week, as in the CDC/ACSM recommendation, has a positive effect on sick leave.",

Over the past few decades, the number of health promotion programmes in workplace settings has continued to grow. Though employer rationales vary, health promotion programmes may yield economic benefits in terms of, for example, reduced absenteeism, presenteeism, employee health care costs, and employee turnover.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine whether the volume and intensity of physical activity are associated with subsequent sickness absence spells of different lengths, and how much of these associations can be explained by socioeconomic position, body mass index (BMI) and physical health functioning. Baseline data were collected by questionnaire surveys in 2000\u20132002 among 40\u201360\u2010year\u2010old employees of Helsinki City (n=6465, 79% women). Sickness absence data were derived from the employer's registers (mean follow\u2010up time 3.9 years). Associations of physical activity with shorter (\u226414 days) and longer (>14 days) sickness absence spells were examined, using Poisson's regression analysis. The volume of physical activity was weakly and somewhat inconsistently associated with sickness absence. However, men and women who were vigorously active systematically had reduced risk of sickness absence, whereas the same volume of moderately intensive physical activity did not reduce the risk of sickness absence. Adjusting for BMI and in particular physical health functioning attenuated these associations, after which the associations lost statistical significance. The results suggest that vigorous physical activity is associated with sickness absence and may contribute to better work ability.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the associations of sleep duration with subsequent weight and major weight gain in women and men during a follow\u2010up period of 5\u20137\u2003years. The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort mail questionnaire surveys among 40\u201360\u2010year\u2010old employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland. At baseline in 2000\u20132002, 8960 people responded to the survey (80% women, response rate 67%). The follow\u2010up survey was conducted in 2007 among all respondents to the baseline survey (n\u2003=\u20037332, response rate 83%). Sleep duration (5\u2003h or less up to 10\u2003h or more) and weight and weight gain of at least 5\u2003kg were based on self\u2010reports. Analyses of variance and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between sleep duration and weight, as well as major weight gain. Short sleep duration was associated with major weight gain [odds ratio (OR) 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 2.14] during the follow\u2010up. Adjusting for several covariates had only minor effects on that association. Long sleep duration was associated with major weight gain after adjusting for age (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.00\u20131.81). No associations were found among men. Sleep duration was associated with major weight gain among middle\u2010aged employed women. Short sleep may be a risk factor for subsequent weight gain.",

        "title": "Physical Activity and Risk of Hypertension: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies",
        "abstract": "Published literature reports controversial results about the association of physical activity (PA) with risk of hypertension. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed to investigate the effect of PA on hypertension risk. PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify all related prospective cohort studies. The Q test and I2 statistic were used to examine between-study heterogeneity. Fixed or random effects models were selected based on study heterogeneity. A funnel plot and modified Egger linear regression test were used to estimate publication bias. Thirteen prospective cohort studies were identified, including 136 846 persons who were initially free of hypertension, and 15 607 persons developed hypertension during follow-up. The pooled relative risk (RR) of main results from these studies suggests that both high and moderate levels of recreational PA were associated with decreased risk of hypertension (high versus low: RR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76\u20130.85 and moderate versus low: RR, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.85\u20130.94). The association of high or moderate occupational PA with decreased hypertension risk was not significant (high versus low: RR, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.81\u20131.08 and moderate versus low: RR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.87\u20131.06). No publication bias was observed. The results of this meta-analysis suggested that there was an inverse dose\u2013response association between levels of recreational PA and risk of hypertension, whereas there was no significant association between occupational PA and hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy of the program Keep Moving toward Healthy Heart and Healthy Brain (KM2H2) in encouraging physical activities for the prevention of heart attack and stroke among hypertensive patients enrolled in the Community-Based Hypertension Control Program (CBHCP). Design Cluster randomized controlled trial with three waves of longitudinal assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months post intervention. Setting Community-based and patient-centered self-care for behavioral intervention in urban settings of China. Participants A total of 450 participants diagnosed with hypertension from 12 community health centers in Wuhan, China were recruited, and were randomly assigned by center to receive either KM2H2 plus standard CBHCP care (6 centers and 232 patients) or the standard care only (6 centers and 218 patients). Intervention KM2H2 is a behavioral intervention guided by the Transtheoretical Model, the Model of Personalized Medicine and Social Capital Theory. It consists of six intervention sessions and two booster sessions engineered in a progressive manner. The purpose is to motivate and maintain physical activities for the prevention of heart attack and stroke. Outcome Measures Heart attack and stroke (clinically diagnosed, primary outcome), blood pressure (measured, secondary outcome), and physical activity (self-report, tertiary outcome) were assessed at the individual level during the baseline, 3- and 6-month post-intervention. Results Relative to the standard care, receiving KM2H2 was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of heart attack (3.60% vs. 7.03%, p < .05) and stroke (5.11% vs. 9.90%, p<0.05), and moderate reduction in blood pressure (-3.72mmHg in DBP and -2.92 mmHg in DBP) at 6-month post-intervention; and significant increases in physical activity at 3- (d = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.85) and 6-month (d = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.85) post-intervention, respectively. Conclusion The program KM2H2 is efficacious to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke among senior patients who are on anti-hypertensive medication. Findings of this study provide solid data supporting a formal phase-III trial to establish the effectiveness of KM2H2 for use in community settings for prevention.

Appropriate food ingredients can significantly decrease stroke risk as recently confirmed for Mediterranean diet. The optimal intensity and amount of physical exercise is still not well established before and after stroke, although modest levels of activity already show benefits. Passive smoking represents an important health hazard. The impact of tobacco withdrawal using e-cigarette is currently uncertain. Alcohol and stroke risk relation is probably J-shaped for ischaemic stroke and linear for intracranial haemorrhage. Coffee consumption is J-shaped for overall stroke. Several interventions have failed to show significant effects, including regular intake of 'healthy' forms of fatty acids, various vitamin supplements, and other antioxidants. Both individualized and public educational programmes are likely needed on a repetitive basis to induce and maintain a healthy lifestyle before or after a stroke.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Nowadays, international organisations such as WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA support a holistic approach towards an individual, aimed at solving life problems, which is missing from educational prevention programmes. At first, the level of knowledge in the individuals should be defined in order to adjust the information concerning an ailment to educational needs. The overall and neurological state of the individual affected by stroke very frequently does not allow to convey much knowledge. Knowledge on stroke results in decreased incidence, which explains the necessity to raise awareness of risk factors for stroke.\n\nThe aim: The aim of the research was to establish a connection between the level of knowledge of the ailment in people affected by stroke and their quality of life.\n\nMaterial and methods: The research included 279 people after stroke. Their quality of life was assessed using a shortened version of the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire. In order to assess the level of knowledge of health-supporting actions after stroke, an indicator of knowledge was created.\n\nResults: The strongest dependence in the somatic (DOM1), social (DOM3) and environmental fields (DOM4) was observed in the group of people between 13 and 24 months after falling ill. The strongest dependence in the psychological field (DOM2) was observed in the group of people between 6 and 12 months after the incident.\n\nConclusion: The level of health-supporting knowledge in people affected by stroke is not satisfactory. A higher level of knowledge results in a higher quality of life.\n\n",
