        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nRimonabant, a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker, may reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in patients who are overweight or obese.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of rimonabant with placebo each in conjunction with diet and exercise for sustained changes in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors over 2 years.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 3045 obese (body mass index > or =30) or overweight (body mass index >27 and treated or untreated hypertension or dyslipidemia) adult patients at 64 US and 8 Canadian clinical research centers from August 2001 to April 2004.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAfter a 4-week single-blind placebo plus diet (600 kcal/d deficit) run-in period, patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg/d of rimonabant, or 20 mg/d of rimonabant for 1 year. Rimonabant-treated patients were rerandomized to receive placebo or continued to receive the same rimonabant dose while the placebo group continued to receive placebo during year 2.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBody weight change over year 1 and prevention of weight regain during year 2. Additional efficacy measures included changes in waist circumference, plasma lipid levels, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt year 1, the completion rate was 309 (51%) patients in the placebo group, 620 (51%) patients in the 5 mg of rimonabant group, and 673 (55%) patients in the 20 mg of rimonabant group. Compared with the placebo group, the 20 mg of rimonabant group produced greater mean (SEM) reductions in weight (-6.3 [0.2] kg vs -1.6 [0.2] kg; P<.001), waist circumference (-6.1 [0.2] cm vs -2.5 [0.3] cm; P<.001), and level of triglycerides (percentage change, -5.3 [1.2] vs 7.9 [2.0]; P<.001) and a greater increase in level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (percentage change, 12.6 [0.5] vs 5.4 [0.7]; P<.001). Patients who were switched from the 20 mg of rimonabant group to the placebo group during year 2 experienced weight regain while those who continued to receive 20 mg of rimonabant maintained their weight loss and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. Use of different imputation methods to account for the high rate of dropouts in all 3 groups yielded similar results. Rimonabant was generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse event was nausea (11.2% for the 20 mg of rimonabant group vs 5.8% for the placebo group).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this multicenter trial, treatment with 20 mg/d of rimonabant plus diet for 2 years promoted modest but sustained reductions in weight and waist circumference and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the trial was limited by a high drop-out rate and longer-term effects of the drug require further study. Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00029861.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nAbdominal obesity is associated with metabolic abnormalities and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, no obesity management strategy has demonstrated the ability to slow progression of coronary disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether weight loss and metabolic effects of the selective cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist rimonabant reduces progression of coronary disease in patients with abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS\nRandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-group, parallel-group trial (enrollment December 2004-December 2005) comparing rimonabant with placebo in 839 patients at 112 centers in North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients received dietary counseling, were randomized to receive rimonabant (20 mg daily) or matching placebo, and underwent coronary intravascular ultrasonography at baseline (n = 839) and study completion (n = 676).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy parameter was change in percent atheroma volume (PAV); the secondary efficacy parameter was change in normalized total atheroma volume (TAV).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the rimonabant vs placebo groups, PAV (95% confidence interval [CI]) increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.54%) vs 0.51% (0.22% to 0.80%) (P = .22), respectively, and TAV decreased 2.2 mm3 (-4.09 to -0.24) vs an increase of 0.88 mm3 (-1.03 to 2.79) (P = .03). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, imputing results based on baseline characteristics for patients not completing the trial, PAV increased 0.25% (-0.04% to 0.55%) vs 0.57% (0.29% to 0.84%) (P = .13), and TAV decreased 1.95 mm3 (-3.8 to -0.10) vs an increase of 1.19 mm3 (-0.73 to 3.12) (P = .02). Rimonabant-treated patients had a larger reduction in body weight (4.3 kg [-5.1 to -3.5] vs 0.5 kg [-1.3 to 0.3]) and greater decrease in waist circumference (4.5 cm [-5.4 to -3.7] vs 1.0 cm [-1.9 to -0.2]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). In the rimonabant vs placebo groups, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 5.8 mg/dL (4.9 to 6.8) (22.4%) vs 1.8 mg/dL (0.9 to 2.7) (6.9%) (P < .001), and median triglyceride levels decreased 24.8 mg/dL (-35.4 to -17.3) (20.5%) vs 8.9 mg/dL (-14.2 to -1.8) (6.2%) (P < .001). Rimonabant-treated patients had greater decreases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (1.3 mg/dL [-1.7 to -1.2] [50.3%] vs 0.9 mg/dL [-1.4 to -0.5] [30.9%]) and less increase in glycated hemoglobin levels (0.11% [0.02% to 0.20%] vs 0.40% [0.31% to 0.49%]) (P < .001 for both comparisons). Psychiatric adverse effects were more common in the rimonabant group (43.4% vs 28.4%, P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter 18 months of treatment, the study failed to show an effect for rimonabant on disease progression for the primary end point (PAV) but showed a favorable effect on the secondary end point (TAV). Determining whether rimonabant is useful in management of coronary disease will require additional imaging and outcomes trials, which are currently under way.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00124332.",

        "abstract": "Background\u2014Rimonabant, the first selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, improves cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese patients. ADAGIO-Lipids assessed the effect of rimonabant on cardiometabolic risk factors and intraabdominal and liver fat. Methods and Results\u2014803 abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides [TG] or reduced high-density lipoprotein\u2013cholesterol [HDL-C]) were randomized to placebo or rimonabant 20 mg/d for 1 year. HDL-C and TG were coprimary end points. Intraabdominal (visceral) and liver fat were measured by computed tomography in a subgroup of 231 patients. In total, 73% of rimonabant- and 70% of placebo-treated patients completed the study treatment. Rimonabant 20 mg produced significantly greater changes from baseline versus placebo in HDL-C (+7.4%) and TG levels (\u221218%; P<0.0001), as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL particle sizes, apolipoprotein A1 and B, HDL2, HDL3, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels (all P<0.05). Rimonabant decreased abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) cross-sectional area by 5.1% compared to placebo (P<0.005), with a greater reduction in visceral AT (\u221210.1% compared to placebo; P<0.0005), thereby reducing the ratio of visceral/subcutaneous AT (P<0.05). Rimonabant significantly reduced liver fat content (liver/spleen attenuation ratio; P<0.005). Systolic (\u22123.3 mm Hg) and diastolic (\u22122.4 mm Hg) blood pressure were significantly reduced with rimonabant versus placebo (P<0.0001). The safety profile of rimonabant was consistent with previous studies; gastrointestinal, nervous system, psychiatric, and general adverse events were more common with rimonabant 20 mg. Conclusions\u2014In abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia, rimonabant 20 mg significantly improved multiple cardiometabolic risk markers and induced significant reductions in both intraabdominal and liver fat.",

        "title": "Neuropsychiatric Adverse Effects of Centrally Acting Antiobesity Drugs",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Central neurochemical systems including the monoamine, opioid, and cannabinoid systems have been promising targets for antiobesity drugs that modify behavioral components of obesity. In addition to modulating eating behavior, centrally acting antiobesity drugs are also likely to alter emotional behavior and cognitive function due to the high expression of receptors for the neurochemical systems targeted by these drugs within the fronto\u2010striatal and limbic circuitry. Methods: This paper reviewed the neuropsychiatric adverse effects of past and current antiobesity drugs, with a central mechanism of action, linking the adverse effects to their underlying neural substrates and neurochemistry. Results: Antiobesity drugs were found to have varying neuropsychiatric adverse event profiles. Insomnia was the most common adverse effect with drugs targeting monoamine systems (sibutramine, bupropion and tesofensine). These drugs had some positive effects on mood and anxiety and may have added therapeutic benefits in obese patients with comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. Sedation and tiredness were the most common adverse effects reported with drugs targeting the m\u2010opioid receptors (i.e., naltrexone) and combination therapies targeting the opioid and monoamine systems (i.e., Contrave\u2122). Cognitive impairments were most frequently associated with the antiepileptic drugs, topiramate and zonisamide, consistent with their sedative properties. Drugs targeting the cannabinoid system (rimonabant and taranabant) were consistently associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression, including reports of suicidal ideation. Similar adverse events have also been noted for the D1/D5 antagonist ecopipam. Conclusion: These findings highlight the need to assess neuropsychiatric adverse events comprehensively using sensitive and validated methods early in the clinical development of candidate antiobesity drugs with a central mechanism of action.",

        "abstract": "The disposition of 1-(8-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-(4-chlorophenyl)-9H- purin-6-yl)-4-(ethylamino)-piperidine-4-carboxamide (CP-945,598), an orally active antagonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, was studied after a single 25-mg oral dose of [14C]CP-945,598 to healthy human subjects. Serial blood samples and complete urine and feces were collected up to 672 h after dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity was 60.1 \u00b1 12.8 from the urine and feces, with the majority of the dose excreted in the feces. The absorption of CP-945,598 in humans was slow with Tmax at 6 h. Less than 2% of the dose was recovered as unchanged drug in the combined excreta, suggesting that CP-945,598 is extensively metabolized. The primary metabolic pathway of CP-945,598 involved N-de-ethylation to form an N-desethyl metabolite (M1), which was then subsequently metabolized by amide hydrolysis (M2), N-hydroxylation (M3), piperidine ring hydroxylation (M6), and ribose conjugation (M9). M3 was further metabolized to oxime (M4) and keto (M5) metabolites. M1, M4, and M5 were the major circulating metabolites, with AUC(0\u201348) values 4.7-, 1.5-, and 1.1-fold greater than that of CP-945,598. M1, M2, and M9 accounted for 5.6, 33.6, and 6.30% of the dose, respectively, in excreta. The results from in vitro experiments with recombinant isoforms suggested that the oxidative metabolism of CP-945,598 to M1 is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4/3A5. The molecular docking study showed that the N-ethyl moiety of CP-945,598 can access to the heme iron-oxo of CYP3A4 in an energetically favored orientation. Together, these data suggest that CP-945,598 is well absorbed and eliminated largely by CYP3A4/3A5-catalyzed metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been implicated in cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy associated with heart failure, and atherosclerosis, in addition to its recognized role in metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Numerous studies have presented contradictory findings about the role of HO-1 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this study, we explored the role of HO-1 in myocardial dysfunction, myofibril structure, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model in mice systemically overexpressing HO-1 (Tg-HO-1) or mutant HO-1 (Tg-mutHO-1). The diabetic mouse model was induced by multiple peritoneal injections of STZ. Two months after injection, left ventricular (LV) function was measured by echocardiography. In addition, molecular biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated using classical molecular biological/biochemical techniques. Mice with DCM exhibited severe LV dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, aberrant cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and increased levels of HO-1. In addition, we determined that systemic overexpression of HO-1 ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction, myofibril structure disarray, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in DCM mice. Furthermore, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation is normally inhibited in DCM, but overexpression of the HO-1 gene restored the phosphorylation of these kinases to normal levels. In contrast, the functions of HO-1 in DCM were significantly reversed by overexpression of mutant HO-1. This study underlines the unique roles of HO-1, including the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and the enhancement of autophagy, in the pathogenesis of DCM.",

        "abstract": "Silymarin (SM), an extract from the Silybum marianum (milk thistle) plant containing various flavonolignans (with silybin being the major one), has received a tremendous amount of attention over the last decade as a herbal remedy for liver treatment. In many cases, the antioxidant properties of SM are considered to be responsible for its protective actions. Possible antioxidant mechanisms of SM are evaluated in this review. (1) Direct scavenging free radicals and chelating free Fe and Cu are mainly effective in the gut. (2) Preventing free radical formation by inhibiting specific ROS-producing enzymes, or improving an integrity of mitochondria in stress conditions, are of great importance. (3) Maintaining an optimal redox balance in the cell by activating a range of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants, mainly via Nrf2 activation is probably the main driving force of antioxidant (AO) action of SM. (4) Decreasing inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathways is an emerging mechanism of SM protective effects in liver toxicity and various liver diseases. (5) Activating vitagenes, responsible for synthesis of protective molecules, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), thioredoxin and sirtuins and providing additional protection in stress conditions deserves more attention. (6) Affecting the microenvironment of the gut, including SM-bacteria interactions, awaits future investigations. (7) In animal nutrition and disease prevention strategy, SM alone, or in combination with other hepatho-active compounds (carnitine, betaine, vitamin B12, etc.), might have similar hepatoprotective effects as described in human nutrition.",

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of orally administered G. kola stem bark ethanolic extract (EEGK) and triterpenoid fraction (TFGK) against sodium arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity using rat models for 14 days. Assays for plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, urea, and creatinine, liver, kidney, and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH) activities were carried out using spectrophotometric methods. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical method was used to identify the bioactive compounds present in TFGK and EEGK. Hematological parameters were assayed using autoanalyzer. Data showed that TFGK reduced liver function markers viz. ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin, while EEGK reduced kidney function markers viz. plasma creatinine and urea. Furthermore, EEGK elevated plasma, liver and kidney SOD, GPx, and GSH while TFGK modulated hematological markers.

This review focuses in detail on the effectiveness of these natural products, and describes the possible mechanisms of the actions in reducing chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced side effects. Recent advances in the efficacy of natural dietary supplements to counteract these side effects are highlighted. In addition, we draw particular attention to gut microbiotan in the context of prebiotic potential of natural products for the protection against cancer therapy-induced toxicities.

In this review, we discuss the dual role that mitophagy plays in cancer and age-related pathologies, as a consequence of oxidative stress, evidencing the triggering stimuli and mechanisms and suggesting the molecular targets for its therapeutic control.

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have fueled ample translation for treatment of immune\u2010mediated diseases. Our previous study had demonstrated that MSCs could elicit macrophages (M\u03c6) into anti\u2010inflammatory phenotypes, and alleviate kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN) mice via improving mitochondrial function of M\u03c6, yet the specific mechanism was unclear. Recent evidence indicated that MSCs communicated with their microenvironment through exchanges of mitochondria. By a coculture system consisting of MSCs and M\u03c6, we showed that MSCs\u2010derived mitochondria (MSCs\u2010Mito) were transferred into M\u03c6, and the mitochondrial functions were improved, which contributed to M2 polarization. Furthermore, we found that MSCs\u2010Mito transfer activated peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor gamma coactivator\u20101 alpha (PGC\u20101\u03b1)\u2010mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, PGC\u20101\u03b1 interacted with TFEB in high glucose\u2010induced M\u03c6, leading to the elevated lysosome\u2010autophagy, which was essential to removal of damaged mitochondria. As a result, in M\u03c6, the mitochondrial bioenergy and capacity to combat inflammatory response were enhanced. Whereas, the immune\u2010regulatory activity of MSCs\u2010Mito was significantly blocked in PGC\u20101\u03b1 knockdown M\u03c6. More importantly, MSCs\u2010Mito transfer could be observed in DN mice, and the adoptive transfer of MSCs\u2010Mito educated M\u03c6 (M\u03c6Mito) inhibited the inflammatory response and alleviated kidney injury. However, the kidney\u2010protective effects of M\u03c6Mito were abolished when the MSCs\u2010Mito was impaired with rotenone, and the similar results were also observed when M\u03c6Mito were transfected with sipgc\u20101\u03b1 before administration. Collectively, these findings suggested that MSCs elicited M\u03c6 into anti\u2010inflammatory phenotype and ameliorated kidney injury through mitochondrial transfer in DN mice, and the effects were relied on PGC\u20101\u03b1\u2010mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and PGC\u20101\u03b1/TFEB\u2010mediated lysosome\u2010autophagy.",

        "title": "Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviate Podocyte Injury in Diabetic Kidney Disease by Modulating Mitophagy via the SIRT1-PGC-1alpha-TFAM Pathway",
        "abstract": "The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has become a new strategy for treating diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the role of placenta derived mesenchymal stem cells (P-MSCs) in DKD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic application and molecular mechanism of P-MSCs on DKD from the perspective of podocyte injury and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy at the animal, cellular, and molecular levels. Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of podocyte injury-related markers and mitophagy-related markers, SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and TFAM. Knockdown, overexpression, and rescue experiments were performed to verify the underlying mechanism of P-MSCs in DKD. Mitochondrial function was detected by flow cytometry. The structure of autophagosomes and mitochondria were observed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, we constructed a streptozotocin-induced DKD rat model and injected P-MSCs into DKD rats. Results showed that as compared with the control group, exposing podocytes to high-glucose conditions aggravated podocyte injury, represented by a decreased expression of Podocin along with increased expression of Desmin, and inhibited PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, manifested as a decreased expression of Beclin1, the LC3II/LC3I ratio, Parkin, and PINK1 associated with an increased expression of P62. Importantly, these indicators were reversed by P-MSCs. In addition, P-MSCs protected the structure and function of autophagosomes and mitochondria. P-MSCs increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content and decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, P-MSCs alleviated podocyte injury and mitophagy inhibition by enhancing the expression of the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1-TFAM pathway. Finally, we injected P-MSCs into streptozotocin-induced DKD rats. The results revealed that the application of P-MSCs largely reversed the markers related to podocyte injury and mitophagy and significantly increased the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, and TFAM compared with the DKD group. In conclusion, P-MSCs ameliorated podocyte injury and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy inhibition in DKD by activating the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1-TFAM pathway.",

        "title": "JiangyaTongluo decoction ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis via regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1/mitophagy axis in hypertensive nephropathy",
        "abstract": "Introduction With the increasing prevalence of hypertension, the incidence of kidney diseases is also increasing, resulting in a serious public burden. Jiangya Tongluo decoction (JYTL), a recognized prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is commonly used to calm an overactive liver and reduce excess yang, while also promoting blood flow to alleviate obstructions in the meridians. Previous research has indicated that JYTL may help mitigate kidney damage caused by hypertension; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly assessed. Methods First, an amalgamation of UPLC-QE/MS and network pharmacology techniques was employed to pinpoint potential active components, primary targets, and crucial action mechanisms of JYTL in treating hypertensive nephropathy (HN). Then, we used spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) to evaluate the efficacy of JYTL on HN with valsartan as a positive reference. We also conducted DCFH-DA fluorescence staining in rat renal tissues to detect the level of ROS. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate further the effect of JYTL decoction on key targets and signaling pathways. Results Through UPLC-QE/MS and network analysis, 189 active ingredients and 5 hub targets were identified from JYTL. GSEA in the MitoCarta3.0 database and PPI network analysis revealed that JYTL predominantly engages in the Sirt1-mitophagy signaling pathway. Tanshinone iia, quercetin, and adenosine in JYTL are the main active ingredients for treating HN. In vivo validation showed that JYTL decoction could improve kidney function, ameliorate tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), and improve mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS production and regulating mitochondrial dynamics in SHRs. JYTL treatment could also increase the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf1, and TFAM, and activate PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Conclusion JYTL decoction may exert renal function protective and anti-fibrosis effects in HN by ameliorating mitochondrial function and regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1-mitophagy pathway.",
