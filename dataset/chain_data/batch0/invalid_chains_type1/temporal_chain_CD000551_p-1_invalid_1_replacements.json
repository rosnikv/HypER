        "abstract": "Recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been described in liver transplant recipients. Type of immunosuppression has been reported to influence the frequency of recurrence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence and pattern of recurrent PBC in our liver transplant recipients and determine any association of immunosuppressive agents with its recurrence. Patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for PBC were identified from the University of Chicago Liver Transplant Database. Recurrent PBC was diagnosed based on specific pathological criteria. Of 46 patients who underwent OLT for PBC between 1984 and 2000, a total of 7 patients (15%) were diagnosed with recurrent PBC at a median of 78 months (range, 27 to 120 months) after OLT. Forty\u2010three percent of patients were administered cyclosporine, whereas 57% were administered tacrolimus before disease recurrence. Rates of recurrence were not different between patients maintained on cyclosporine therapy (16%) compared with those maintained on tacrolimus therapy (18%; P = 1.0). There also was no difference in frequency of rejection episodes or duration of corticosteroid therapy between those who did and did not have recurrent PBC. In conclusion, recurrent PBC developed in a small number of patients 2 years or longer after OLT. In our population, there was no difference in recurrence rates between those administered cyclosporine or tacrolimus for immunosuppression. (Liver Transpl 2003;9:733\u2010736.)",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only effective curative therapy for end\u2010stage primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Survival after OLT is excellent, although recent data have shown a recurrence rate of PBC of up to 32% after transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate the course after disease recurrence, particularly with regard to liver function and survival in a long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Between April 1989 and April 2003, 1553 liver transplantations were performed in 1415 patients at the Charit\u00e9, Virchow Clinic. Protocol liver biopsies were taken after one, three, five, seven, 10 and 13\u2003yr. One hundred (7%) patients suffered from histologically proven PBC. Primary immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (n=54) or tacrolimus (Tac) (n=46). Immediately after OLT, all patients received ursodeoxycholic acid. Corticosteroids were withdrawn three to six months after OLT. The median age of the 85 women and 15 men was 55\u2003yr (range 25\u201366\u2003yr). The median follow\u2010up after liver transplantation was 118 months (range 16\u2013187 months) and after recurrence 30 months (range 4\u201379 months). Actuarial patient survival after five, 10 and 15\u2003yr was 87, 84 and 82% respectively. Ten patients (10%) died after a median survival time of 32 months. Two of these patients developed organ dysfunction owing to recurrence of PBC. Histological recurrence was found in 14 patients (14%) after a median time of 61 months (range 36\u2013122 months). Patients with Tac immunosuppression developed PBC recurrence more often (p<0.05) and also earlier (p<0.05). Fifty\u2010seven patients developed an acute rejection and two patients a chronic rejection episode. Liver function did not alter within the first five\u2003yr after histologically proven PBC recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the investigated patients showed that the recipient's age and Tac immunosuppression were significant risk factors for PBC recurrence. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up of up to 15\u2003yr after liver transplantation, owing to PBC, in addition to maintenance of liver function, shows excellent organ and patient survival rates. Although protocol liver biopsies revealed histological recurrence in 14 (14%) patients, only two patients developed graft dysfunction. Tac\u2010treated patients showed more frequently and also earlier histologically proven PBC recurrence; however, in our population we could not observe an impact on graft dysfunction and patient's survival.",

        "abstract": "The recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in the hepatic allograft may impact patient and graft survival with long\u2010term follow\u2010up. The efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for treatment of recurrent PBC after liver transplantation (LT) remains less well known. The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to determine the significance of recurrent PBC on overall survival among PBC patients who underwent LT, and 2) to determine the efficacy of UDCA treatment after LT in patients with recurrent PBC. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 154 PBC patients who underwent LT with at least 1 yr of follow\u2010up after transplantation from 1985 through 2005. A total of 52 patients with recurrent PBC were identified. After adjusting for age and gender, recurrent PBC was not associated with death or liver retransplantation (hazard ratio, 0.97, 95% confidence interval, 0.41\u20132.31; P = 0.9). A total of 38 patients with recurrent PBC received UDCA at an average dose of 12 mg/kg/day for a mean duration of 55 months. Over a 36\u2010month period, an estimated 52% of UDCA\u2010treated patients experienced normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase compared to 22% of untreated patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of histological progression between subgroups. UDCA did not influence patient and graft survival. In conclusion, the development of recurrent PBC has little impact on long\u2010term survival or need for retransplantation. While UDCA therapy is associated with biochemical improvement, its role in delaying histologic progression remains unknown. In this short period of treatment, UDCA was not associated with improved patient and graft survival compared to untreated patients. Liver Transpl 13:1236\u20131245, 2007. \u00a9 2007 AASLD.",

        "abstract": "The book Transplantation Pathology has been in print since February 2009 and probably due for revision. Edited by Phillip Ruiz, the book lined up an impressive roster of leading experts in the field of solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Chapters 2\u20139 are each devoted to an organ system or group of organ systems, making for easy reading and practical resource for everyday practice. The clinical and histopathological illustrations, especially in the dermatology chapter (chapter 2) do much justice to the authors\u2019 efforts. The arrangement within each chapter is methodological and easy to follow. However while beginning with Immunopathology of Organ Transplantation is to be applauded, it might have been better to follow-up with chapter 11 (Laboratory Medicine in Transplantation) to provide the readers with key pathophysiological tool for the understanding of the subsequently described phenotypes resulting from the immunopathological processes and detection methods in chapters 1 and 11. Most of the information presented in this book remains valid and applicable to everyday practice. However many aspects of this book need to be updated on account of progress made since the book was first published. For example the literature and criteria have changed in how we assess and evaluate antibody-mediated rejections in most organs especially the liver, kidney and heart. Also the experience garnered from composite transplantation has improved our understanding even if this area still lags significantly behind the other solid organ allografts. In summary this book, Transplantation Pathology continues to offer a practical tool for pathologists and other medical specialists involved in managing allograft patients. The inclusion of most organ systems with impressive illustrations makes it a \u2018one-stop\u2019 place to obtain relevant information for day-to-day practice, as well as a valuable asset to trainees. This book therefore attains an excellent score on this review. The editor and authors should however consider updating this document to address recent changes that have made their way into standard of care.",

        "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs) can recur following liver transplantation (LT) despite immunosuppressive therapy, with implications for graft survival. Although the evidence is not robust, disease recurrence seems to occur in the presence of less intense and/or steroid\u2010free immunosuppression (IS) in particular in the case of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The main risk factor for AIH recurrence is the severity of disease activity in the explant and potential donor/recipient human leukocyte antigen D\u2010related 3 (DR3) mismatch. The treatment for AIH recurrence includes reintroduction or increase in the dose of steroids with or without the addition of azathioprine. T cell\u2013mediated rejection episodes are also more common in AILD. Steroid withdrawal is the common practice in LT for non\u2010AILD, eliminating the risks associated with longterm exposure to steroids. In AILD, maintenance of steroids at a low dose in the long term may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and rejection. This strategy is safe when there is vigilance for steroid\u2010related adverse effects. Alternatively, identifying patients who are at the greatest risk for disease recurrence and who would benefit from intensified IS might be an option.",

Risk factors for recurrence and its impact on long-term patient outcome are poorly defined. We aimed to assess prevalence, time to disease recurrence, as well as patient and graft survival in patients with recurrent AIH (rAIH) versus those without recurrence. Methods Single-center retrospective study of adult recipients who underwent LT for AIH between January 2007 and December 2017. Patients with AIH overlap syndromes were excluded. Results A total of 1436 LTs were performed during the study period, of whom 46 (3%) for AIH. Eight patients had AIH overlap syndromes and were excluded. Patients were followed up for 4.4 \u00b1 3.4 years and mean age at LT was 46.8 years. Average transplant MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score was 24.9. About 21% of patients (8 of 38) were transplanted for acute onset of AIH; 66% of patients (n = 25) received a deceased donor liver graft, and 34% a living donor organ. rAIH occurred in 7.8% (n = 3/38) of recipients. Time to recurrence was 1.6, 12.2 and 60.7 months. Patient and graft survival in patients without recurrence was 88.6% and 82.8% in 5 years, whereas in those with rAIH, it was 66.7%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases are characterized by immune-mediated inflammation and eventual destruction of the hepatocytes and the biliary epithelial cells. They can progress to irreversible liver damage requiring liver transplantation. The post-liver transplant goals of treatment include improving the recipient\u2019s survival, preventing liver graft-failure, and decreasing the recurrence of the disease. The keystone in post-liver transplant management for autoimmune liver diseases relies on identifying which would be the most appropriate immunosuppressive maintenance therapy. The combination of a steroid and a calcineurin inhibitor is the current immunosuppressive regimen of choice for autoimmune hepatitis. A gradual withdrawal of glucocorticoids is also recommended. On the other hand, ursodeoxycholic acid should be initiated soon after liver transplant to prevent recurrence and improve graft and patient survival in primary biliary cholangitis recipients. Unlike the previously mentioned autoimmune diseases, there are not immunosuppressive or disease-modifying agents available for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, colectomy and annual colonoscopy are key components during the post-liver transplant period.",

The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood, but, according to various sources, it involves genetic factors, innate and adaptive immunity mechanisms, the toxic effects of hydrophobic bile acids and, possibly, intestinal dysbiosis. The strong association with inflammatory bowel disease is associated with a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer, which, along with cholangiocarcinoma, represents the most significant diagnostic challenge in the long-term management of PSC. The diagnosis of PSC is established based on the identification of typical cholangiographic lesions of the bile ducts and the exclusion of secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis. Complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity of clinical features and the rare nature of the disease have led to the lack of effective therapy to date; there are no treatment algorithms, but a course of ursodeoxycholic acid in doses of 17\u201323 mg/kg/day can be prescribed for up to a year in order to monitor the dynamics of the decrease in levels serum alkaline phosphatase.
