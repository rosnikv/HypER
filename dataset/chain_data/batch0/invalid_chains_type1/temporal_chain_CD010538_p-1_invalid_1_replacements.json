        "title": "Efficacy of symptomatic control of knee osteoarthritis with 0.0125% of capsaicin versus placebo.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent and associated with both pain and functional disability. Current treatments aim to alleviate mild to moderate symptoms by various methods. Topical capsaicin (0.075% and 0.05%) has been evaluated for the treatment of the painful joints. A burning sensation was the most common side effect at these strengths. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 0.0125% capsaicin gel (Capsika gel) compared to a placebo (the vehicle gel) in patients with symptomatic OA knee.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\nThis was a cross-over; double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 100 patients with mild to moderate knee OA. All of the patients received either capsaicin gel or placebo gel applied to the affected knee, three times daily for 4 weeks with one week washout period after which the treatment switched to either capsaicin gel or placebo gel for the next 4 weeks. A blinded examiner used the visual analog scale (VAS) and WOMAC score to do weekly assessments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects averaged 61 years of age (range, 44 to 82). During the enrollment phase, only female farmers presented. Mean body weight and height was 62.97 +/- 10.25 kg and 1.54 +/- 0.053 m, respectively The respective baseline VAS and WOMAC score was 6.40 +/- 1.64 and 51.65 +/- 13.3. The severity of OA, according to the KL criteria was: 83 patients with grade 2 and 16 with grade 3. The respective mean difference of VAS and total WOMAC score in the capsaicin group vs. the placebo group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean difference of the WOMAC pain, stiffness and functional subscales in the capsaicin vs. the placebo group was also significant (p < 0.05). The only adverse event reported was a burning sensation. During the 4-week treatment with capsaicin, approximately 67% of patients had a burning sensation but none withdrew for this reason.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n0.0125% capsaicin gel was an effective treatment in mildly to moderately painful OA knees. The burning sensation reported by patients in the capsaicin group was less disturbing than in previous studies and none of the present patients withdrew for this reason.",

        "title": "Diabetic Neuropathy: A Randomized, Double- Blind, Crossover, Placebo-Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "& Abstract Background: Topical therapy may provide additional benefit in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). This study was conducted to study the safety and efficacy of 0.025% capsaicin gel in this condition. Methods: A 20-week, double-blind, crossover, randomized, single-center study enrolled subjects with PDN. They received 0.025% capsaicin gel or placebo for 8 weeks, with a washout period of 4 weeks between the two treatments. Primary efficacy end point was percent change in visual analog scale (0\u2013100 mm) of pain severity. Secondary outcomes were score change in Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS), short-form McGill Pain Questionnaires (SF-MPQ), proportion of patients who had pain score reductions of 30% and 50%, and adverse event. Results: Of the 35 subjects screened, 33 were enrolled and 33 completed at least an 8-week treatment period. Intentionto-treat analysis showed no significant improvement in pain with capsaicin gel, compared with placebo with visual analog scale (VAS) score 28.8 mm vs. 34.6 mm (P = 0.53). No significant difference between the groups was found in SF-MPQ (7.4 vs. 7.71, P = 0.95), NPS (29.4 vs. 31.3, P = 0.81), and proportion of patients who had 30% or 50% pain relief. Capsaicin gel was well tolerated with minor skin reaction. Conclusions: 0.025% capsaicin gel is safe and well tolerated, but does not provide significant pain relief in patients with PDN. &",

        "title": "Reducing CXCR 4-mediated nociceptor hyperexcitability reverses painful diabetic neuropathy",
        "abstract": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is an intractable complication of diabetes that affects 25% of patients. PDN is characterized by neuropathic pain and small-fiber degeneration, accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor hyperexcitability and loss of their axons within the skin. The molecular mechanisms underlying DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability and small-fiber degeneration in PDN are unknown. We hypothesize that chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is central to this mechanism, as we have shown that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is necessary for the development of mechanical allodynia, a pain hypersensitivity behavior common in PDN. Focusing on DRG neurons expressing the sodium channel Nav1.8, we applied transgenic, electrophysiological, imaging, and chemogenetic techniques to test this hypothesis. In the high-fat diet mouse model of PDN, we were able to prevent and reverse mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration by limiting CXCR4 signaling or neuronal excitability. This study reveals that excitatory CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration in a mouse model of PDN. Hence, we propose that targeting CXCR4-mediated DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic approach for disease-modifying treatments for this currently intractable and widespread affliction.

        "title": "Neuroinflammation Involved in Diabetes-Related Pain and Itch",
        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic with increasing incidence, which results in diverse complications, seriously affects the patient quality of life, and brings huge economic burdens to society. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common chronic complication of DM, resulting in neuropathic pain and chronic itch. The precise mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy have not been fully clarified, hindering the exploration of novel therapies for diabetic neuropathy and its terrible symptoms such as diabetic pain and itch. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiologic process of neuropathic pain and chronic itch. Indeed, researchers have currently made significant progress in knowing the role of glial cells and the pro-inflammatory mediators produced from glial cells in the modulation of chronic pain and itch signal processing. Here, we provide an overview of the current understanding of neuroinflammation in contributing to the sensitization of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, we also summarize the inflammation mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic itch, including activation of glial cells, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory factors. Targeting excessive neuroinflammation may provide potential and effective therapies for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and itch in DM.",

        "title": "Wnt5a/Ryk signaling contributes to bone cancer pain by sensitizing the peripheral nociceptors through JNK-mediated TRPV1 pathway in rats.",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nTreating bone cancer pain (BCP) continues to be a clinical challenge, and the underlying mechanisms of BCP remain elusive. This study reports that Wnt5a/Ryk signaling in the dorsal root ganglion neurons is critical to the development of BCP. Tibia bone cavity tumor cell implantation produces spontaneous and evoked behaviorally expressed pain as well as ectopic sprouting and activity of Wnt5a/Ryk signaling in the neural soma and peripheral terminals and the tumor-affected bone tissues. Intraplantar, intratibial, or intrathecal injection of Wnt5a/Ryk signaling blockers significantly suppresses the painful symptoms. Peripheral injection of exogenous Wnt5a in na\u00efve rats produces pain, and the dorsal root ganglion neurons become more sensitive to Wnt5a. Wnt5a/Ryk signaling activation increases intracellular calcium response and expression of transient receptors potential vanilloid type-1 and regulates capsaicin-induced intracellular calcium response. Blocking Ryk receptor activation suppresses Wnt5a-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Wnt5a facilitation of transient receptors potential vanilloid type-1 sensitization is blocked by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. These findings indicate a critical peripheral mechanism of Wnt5a/Ryk signaling underlying the pathogenesis of BCP and suggest that targeting Wnt5a/Ryk in the primary sensory neurons and the tumor-invasive area may be an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of BCP.",
