        "title": "Low-frequency electroacupuncture and physical exercise decrease high muscle sympathetic nerve activity in polycystic ovary syndrome.",
        "abstract": "We have recently shown that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with high muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Animal studies support the concept that low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and physical exercise, via stimulation of ergoreceptors and somatic afferents in the muscles, may modulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of these interventions on sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. In a randomized controlled trial, 20 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to one of three groups: low-frequency EA (n = 9), physical exercise (n = 5), or untreated control (n = 6) during 16 wk. Direct recordings of multiunit efferent postganglionic MSNA in a muscle fascicle of the peroneal nerve before and following 16 wk of treatment. Biometric, hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic parameters were measured. Low-frequency EA (P = 0.036) and physical exercise (P = 0.030) decreased MSNA burst frequency compared with the untreated control group. The low-frequency EA group reduced sagittal diameter (P = 0.001), while the physical exercise group reduced body weight (P = 0.004) and body mass index (P = 0.004) compared with the untreated control group. Sagittal diameter was related to MSNA burst frequency (Rs = 0.58, P < 0.005) in the EA group. No correlation was found for body mass index and MSNA in the exercise group. There were no differences between the groups in hemodynamic, endocrine, and metabolic variables. For the first time we demonstrate that low-frequency EA and physical exercise lowers high sympathetic nerve activity in women with PCOS. Thus, treatment with low-frequency EA or physical exercise with the aim to reduce MSNA may be of importance for women with PCOS.",

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age that is associated with significant adverse short- and long-term health consequences. Multiple metabolic aberrations, such as insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinaemia, high incidence of impaired glucose tolerance, visceral obesity, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and dyslipidemia are associated with the syndrome. Assessing the metabolic aberrations and their long term health impact in women with PCOS is challenging and becomes more important as therapeutic interventions currently available for the management of PCOS are not fully able to deal with all these consequences. Current therapeutic management of PCOS has incorporated new treatments resulting from the better understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of old, new and emerging therapies used in the management of PCOS, on the metabolic aberrations of PCOS",

        "abstract": "Whether or not blood pressure (BP) and heart function of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are altered remains unclear, albeit subtle abnormalities in the regulation of BP observed in these women might suggest a mild masculinization of their cardiovascular system. To study the influence of obesity and androgen excess on BP and echocardiographic profiles of women with the syndrome, we conducted a cross-sectional case\u2013control study comparing office and ambulatory BP monitoring, as well as echocardiographic assessments, in 63 premenopausal women with the classic phenotype, 33 nonhyperandrogenic women with regular menses, and 25 young men. Forty-nine subjects were lean and 72 had weight excess (body mass index \u226525 kg/m2). Participants had no previous history of hypertension and were nonsmokers. Men showed the highest BP readings, and the lowest readings were observed in control women, whereas women with PCOS had intermediate values. Undiagnosed hypertension was more common in subjects with weight excess irrespective of sex and hyperandrogenism. Women with PCOS and weight excess showed frequencies of previously undiagnosed hypertension that were similar to those of men with weight excess and higher than those observed in nonhyperandrogenic women. Lastly, male sex, weight excess and hypertension, the latter in men as well as in women with PCOS, increased left ventricular wall thickness. In summary, our results show that patients with classic PCOS and weight excess frequently have undiagnosed BP abnormalities, leading to target organ damage.",

        "title": "Roles for the sympathetic nervous system, renal nerves, and CNS melanocortin-4 receptor in the elevated blood pressure in hyperandrogenemic female rats.",
        "abstract": "Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperandrogenemia and increased prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including elevated blood pressure. We recently characterized a hyperandrogenemic female rat (HAF) model of PCOS [chronic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) beginning at 4 wk of age] that exhibits similar characteristics as women with PCOS. In the present studies we tested the hypotheses that the elevated blood pressure in HAF rats is mediated in part by sympathetic activation, renal nerves, and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) activation. Adrenergic blockade with terazosin and propranolol or renal denervation reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP by telemetry) in HAF rats but not controls. Hypothalamic MC4R expression was higher in HAF rats than controls, and central nervous system MC4R antagonism with SHU-9119 (1 nmol/h icv) reduced MAP in HAF rats. Taking a genetic approach, MC4R null and wild-type (WT) female rats were treated with DHT or placebo from 5 to 16 wk of age. MC4R null rats were obese and had higher MAP than WT control rats, and while DHT increased MAP in WT controls, DHT failed to further increase MAP in MC4R null rats. These data suggest that increases in MAP with chronic hyperandrogenemia in female rats are due, in part, to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, renal nerves, and MC4R and may provide novel insights into the mechanisms responsible for hypertension in women with hyperandrogenemia such as PCOS.",

        "title": "Serum testosterone acts as a prognostic indicator in polycystic ovary syndrome\u2010associated kidney injury",
        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is closely related with the onset and development of metabolic abnormalities. However, the correlation between PCOS and kidney injury has not been clarified, and the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we performed a prospective survey in 55 PCOS and 69 healthy participants. Furthermore, the correlation analyses between serum testosterone and renal functional manifestations of patients and healthy subjects, including urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary \u03ba\u2010light chains (KapU), urinary \u03bb\u2010light chains (LamU), urinary \u03b11\u2010microglobulin (\u03b11\u2010MU), and urinary \u03b22\u2010microglobulin (\u03b22\u2010MU), were analyzed. Compared with that in normal subjects, the levels of serum testosterone and UACR were significantly higher in PCOS patients. Serum testosterone is significantly correlated with the disease severity of PCOS. Although urinary excretions of KapU, LamU, \u03b11\u2010MU, and \u03b22\u2010MU did not increase in PCOS patients, they had a significantly positive correlation with the extent of serum testosterone in PCOS patients. IN vitro, primary cultured human ovary granulosa cells (GCs) were isolated from the follicular fluid (FF) extracting from PCOS patients and controls. FF, especially which extracted from PCOS patients with a high expression of serum testosterone, significantly induced cell apoptosis and inflammation in human GCs. To examine the communication between PCOS and kidney injury, a human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HKC\u20108) was cultured and administered FF. Interestingly, FF from PCOS patients with a higher level of serum testosterone induced fibrotic lesions in HKC\u20108 cells. These data suggest serum testosterone plays a critical role in PCOS and PCOS\u2010associated kidney injury. Serum testosterone may serve as a promising indicator for kidney fibrotic injury outcomes in PCOS patients.",

        "abstract": "The susceptibility and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, and preexisting pulmonary, metabolic, renal, and cardiac conditions. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women, is associated with obesity, hyperandrogenism, and cardiometabolic dysregulations. We analyzed cardiac, renal, circulatory, and urinary SARS-CoV-2 viral entry proteins (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17) and androgen receptor (AR) expression, in a peripubertal androgen exposure model of PCOS. Peripubertal female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and low (LFD) or high (HFD) fat diet for 90 days. HFD exacerbated DHT-induced increase in body weight, fat mass, and cardiac and renal hypertrophy. In the heart, DHT upregulated AR protein in both LFD and HFD, ACE2 in HFD, and ADAM17 in LFD. In the kidney, AR protein expression was upregulated by both DHT and HFD. Moreover, ACE2 and ADAM17 were upregulated by DHT in both diets. Renal TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsin L were upregulated by DHT and differentially modulated by the diet. DHT upregulated urinary ACE2 in both diets, while neither treatment modified serum ACE2. Renal AR mRNA expression positively correlated with Ace2, Tmprss2, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17. Our findings suggest that women with PCOS could be a population with a high risk of COVID-19-associated cardiac and renal complications. Furthermore, our study suggests that weight loss by lifestyle modifications (i.e., diet) could potentially mitigate COVID-19-associated deleterious cardiorenal outcomes in women with PCOS.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinologic disorder among women of childbearing age. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study aimed to determine the levels of renin, d-dimer, and some relevant biomarkers in patients with PCOS (with and without COVID-19) compared with non-PCOS patients (with and without COVID-19).\nMethods: This cross-sectional study included 120 women [80 PCOS women (40 with COVID-19 and 40 without COVID-19) and 40 non-PCOS women (20 with COVID-19 and 20 without)] with age range of 15\u201340 years old. Blood samples were collected from participants, and biochemical assays were carried out. Renin and d-dimer levels were determined using the enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA), lipid-profile and fasting blood glucose concentrations were assessed by using the colorimetric methods, and hormones were evaluated by VIDAS.\nResults: Renin and d-dimer levels were found to be significantly higher in PCOS-women groups compared to non-PCOS group. In addition, the results showed that hormones, fasting blood glucose, and lipid-profile are significantly increased in PCOS patients compared to non-PCOS women, while high-density-lipoprotein and follicle-stimulating-hormone levels were low when comparing PCOS patients with non-PCOS ones. The results also showed that a highly significant increase in renin and d-dimer levels can be detected in PCOS patients with COVID-19.\nConclusions: In the present study, we found there is a possible relationship between renin and d-dimer in PCOS patients who are also COVID-19 infected.",
