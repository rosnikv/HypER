        "abstract": "AIMS\nWe studied a novel sirolimus eluting stent with a bioabsorbable coating (SES) in >3 months old chronic total coronary occlusions (CTO).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nNinety-five patients were randomised to either BMS (n=47) or SES (n=48). The primary endpoints were late lumen loss (LLL) and in-segment restenosis (ISR) after six months. Secondary endpoints were target vessel revascularisation after six and 24 months. Occlusion length (37.6 mm), reference diameter (2.8 mm) as well as the stented segment (45.5 mm) were similar in both groups. Up until six months no death, myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis occurred in either group. Angiographic follow-up (45BMS/46SES): LLL 1.8 mm/0.77 mm (p<0.0001), ISR 60%/17.4% (p<0.0001). In-segment re-occlusion 15.5%/0% and TVR 53.3%/10.8% (p<0.0001). After 24 months: 1 BMS, 2 SES patients died; 0 BMS, 0 SES infarction; 0 BMS, 0 SES stent thrombosis and 3 BMS, 0 SES TVR between six and 24 months. Thus total TVR after 24 months was 60% for BMS and 10.8% for SES (p<0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe alternative sirolimus-coated stent was shown to reduce the relative risk of restenosis after six months by 71%, and of TVR after 24 months by 82%. Between six and 24 months, neither stent thrombosis occurred, nor repeat revascularisation was required in patients who received a SES.",

        "abstract": "Percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusions (CTOs), the most difficult and time-consuming intervention, is evolving rapidly. There has been a well-documented increase in the success rate of procedures in the hands of specifically trained operators from about 60 % to 90 % over the past 10 years; at the same moment the long-term patency with drug-eluting stents is exceeding 90 %. These results are comparable or even superior to surgical revascularisation. Several sophisticated techniques unique to CTO interventions are described in this article and the need for specific training is emphasised so that a success rate of at least 80 % can be met, as claimed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on myocardial revascularisation, and so that patients with CTO who deserve revascularisation are no longer denied appropriate treatment.",

        "title": "Faster, easier, safer: \u201cguideliner reverse CART\u201d for retrograde chronic total occlusion interventions",
        "abstract": "The retrograde approach has revolutionized percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) by significantly improving success rates [1,2]. The retrograde approach involves two main steps: (a) delivering a guidewire and microcatheter distal to the occlusion via a collateral vessel and (b) crossing the CTO segment [2,3]. CTO crossing can be achieved using three techniques (Fig. 1a): (a) using the distal true lumen guidewire as a marker for antegrade guidewire crossing (\u201cjust marker\u201d and \u201ckissing wire\u201d techniques); (b) achieving \u201ctrue to true\u201d lumen crossing with the retrograde guidewire; or (c) using dissection/re-entry techniques, in which the guidewire is redirected from the subintimal space into the true lumen. There are two main dissection/re-entry techniques: in controlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART), a balloon is inflated over the retrograde guidewire allowing the antegrade guidewire to enter the distal true lumen. In reverse CART a balloon is inflated over the antegrade guidewire followed by retrograde guidewire crossing into the proximal true lumen using the space created by the antegrade balloon inflation. With the advent of the channel dilator (Corsair, Asahi Intecc, Nagoya, Japan), reverse CART is currently the most commonly utilized retrograde CTO crossing technique, since it is very common for the antegrade and retrograde guidewires to enter the subintimal space during CTO segment crossing attempts, especially in long occluded segments. Reverse CART also allows for wire externalization, which provides the strongest support for balloon/stent delivery. However, reverse CART may be difficult to perform, necessitating the development of several facilitating techniques. One such technique is the use of large balloons over the antegrade guidewire. Another technique is the use of intravascular ultrasonography, which allows better understanding of the spatial relationship between the antegrade and retrograde guidewires, plaque morphology, vessel size, and allows selection of suitable size balloon for subintimal space dilation [4]. Still, recoil of the subintimal space may occur, even when adequately sized balloons are used. To solve this problem, several additional techniques were developed. The \u201cstent reverse CART\u201d technique involves deploying a stent over the antegrade wire in the subintimal space to create a target for the retrograde wire. Deploying a snare in the antegrade subintimal space can prevent recoil and facilitate retrograde wire crossing into the antegrade true lumen. However, \u201cstent reverse CART\u201d cannot be reversed, i.e. a deployed stent cannot be retrieved and the use of a snare can be cumbersome and expensive. In this issue of the Journal, Mozid et al. describe a novel and elegant modification of reverse CART, the \u201cGuideliner reverse CART\u201d [5] (Fig. 1b). A guide catheter extension is advanced over the antegrade guidewire, creating a new \u201ctarget\u201d for the retrograde guidewire to enter. This technique can achieve re-entry faster and safer compared to the traditional reverse CART technique. For instance, reverse CART in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) can cause left main injury, which may compromise the left circumflex artery. By inserting a guide catheter extension into the proximal LAD, re-entry can be achieved safely without injuring the left main bifurcation. Furthermore, when performing reverse CART in distal vessels, i.e. the distal right coronary artery, it is sometimes very difficult or impossible for the retrograde",
