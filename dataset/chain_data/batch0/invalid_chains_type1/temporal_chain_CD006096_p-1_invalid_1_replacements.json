        "abstract": "Background:\u2002 Collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon with a benign and sometimes relapsing course. Frequency among patients with chronic diarrhea and normal looking colonoscopy is around 10\u201315%. To date, treatment of CC and LC is not well defined. Data about these conditions are mostly derived from retrospective studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response to treatment and the clinical course of CC and LC in a large group of patients prospectively diagnosed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCollagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active collagenous colitis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nRelevant papers published between 1970 and January 2002 were identified via the MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nFour randomized trials were identified. One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), and 3 trials (2 published in abstract form only) studied budesonide in the therapy of collagenous colitis.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThere were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active drug were more likely to have clinical (p=0.003) and histological (p=0.003) improvement than those assigned to placebo. A total of 86 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 16.79 (95% CI 7.28-38.74), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nBudesonide is effective in the treatment of collagenous colitis. The evidence for bismuth subsalicylate is weaker, but still important. The roles of these and other therapies in inducing or maintaining remission (as opposed to clinical or histological improvement) of collagenous colitis are unknown.",

        "abstract": "Collagenous gastritis (CG) characterized by the deposition of a subepithelial collagen band and accompanying inflammatory infiltrate is a rare disorder. The natural history and pathogenesis of CG remain unclear. We describe the histologic features (23 gastric, 18 duodenal, and 4 colonic biopsies) and clinical findings of an additional 12 cases. Histologic features including active or chronic inflammation, surface epithelial injury, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, intestinal metaplasia, and Helicobacter pylori, and measurement of thickness of subepithelial collagenous band were evaluated in gastric biopsies. The clinical features, endoscopic findings, and follow-up were obtained and correlated with histologic features. There was an even number of males (n=6) and females (n=6). Four patients were children/young adults, 3 of whom (75%) presented with anemia and gastric nodularity. Eight patients were adults, 6 of whom (75%) had an associated autoimmune disease (1 with Hashimoto thyroiditis and polymyositis) or other intestinal disease (3 with celiac sprue, 1 with collagenous colitis, 1 with collagenous sprue), in contrast to none in the 4 children/young adults, P=0.06. The range of subepithelial collagen thickness was 15 to 120\u2009\u03bcm in CG. The collagenous layer showed surface epithelial injury and entrapped inflammatory cells. On presentation, the thickened collagen distribution in the antrum and body was variably patchy and diffuse. Four (33%) patients showed lymphocytic gastritis (3 within the same biopsy); one of these patients also had celiac sprue and another had collagenous sprue. Three (25%) patients had celiac sprue (2 had duodenal biopsy proven and 1 had a clinical diagnosis of celiac sprue). An additional patient had duodenal biopsies showing collagenous sprue. Four patients had follow-up biopsies during a 3 to 119-month period after the diagnosis of CG. CG persisted on the follow-up gastric biopsies in 3 (75%) of the 4 patients, and the other patient had lymphocytic gastritis, a finding not seen in previous biopsies. CG is a rare disorder with a distinct presentation and association in pediatric and adult patients. An absence of associated intestinal and autoimmune diseases characterizes the pediatric population. Association with lymphocytic gastritis, celiac or collagenous sprue, collagenous colitis, and autoimmune disorders are frequently seen in adult patients.",

        "abstract": "Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, the two types of microscopic colitis, cause watery diarrhea. Budesonide, a glucocorticoid medication with limited systemic availability, is commonly used to treat these illnesses. Budesonide has proven efficacy in the induction of clinical remission in both collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. Budesonide is effective as a maintenance drug for patients with collagenous colitis, but has not been studied for this indication in patients with lymphocytic colitis. This drug improves quality of life in patients while causing few mild adverse events. Budesonide is an effective treatment of microscopic colitis that is safe and well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "Chronic diarrhea can have a substantial impact on the patient\u2019s quality of life and overall health. Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory bowel disease, which is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea. Many drugs, including steroids, had emerged to treat MC. Our aim was testing the efficacy of Budesonide enema in improvement of patients with collagenous microscopic colitis both clinically and histo-pathologiclly. 22 patients with active microscopic colitis were enrolled in the present study, 15 women, and 7 men, with mean age of 60.9\u00b18.5 years. Mean duration of symptoms was 2.6\u00b10.8 years. Patients were given Budesonide enema 2mg/100ml twice daily for 2 weeks then, once daily for 4 weeks. They were evaluated both clinically and histopathologically after 6 weeks.18 patients (81.8%) showed high statistically significant decrease in the thickness of collage layer, and degree of inflammation. The patients\u2019 frequency of stool decreased from 7.6\u00b11.0 to 2.7\u00b11.6 motions/day (p<0.001), and also consistency of stool improved (p<0.001).We concluded that Budesonide enema in a dose of 2 mg/100ml was well tolerated and effective in induction of remission in active collagenous colitis. Effects on both clinical symptoms and inflammatory infiltrate were seen. Recurrence rate after stopping treatment is moderate. Non-responders may need prolonged duration of treatment or omitting the drugs that may be responsible for colonic inflammation.",
