        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUrsodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) therapy leads to major improvements in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The benefit of long-term treatment is uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 145 patients with biopsy-proved primary biliary cirrhosis to receive ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) (72 patients) or placebo (73 patients). After two years of follow-up, because of the benefit from ursodiol, all patients completing the study received ursodiol in an open trial and were monitored for two more years. The end points in the assessment of efficacy were as follows: progression of disease, as defined by the presence of hyperbilirubinemia, variceal bleeding, ascites, or encephalopathy; liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure; and liver transplantation (or a referral) or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDisease progressed significantly less frequently in the ursodiol group than in the placebo group (P < 0.002; relative risk, 0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.63). The probability of liver transplantation or a referral for that procedure and the probability of transplantation or death were significantly lower in the group assigned to ursodiol than in the group assigned to placebo (for transplantation alone, P = 0.003; relative risk, 0.21; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.66; for transplantation or death, P = 0.005; relative risk, 0.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.74). High bilirubin levels and, to a lesser extent, signs of cirrhosis at entry into the trial were predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or a referral, and transplantation or death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term ursodiol therapy slows the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis and reduces the need for liver transplantation.",

This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) transfusion in PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a single-arm trial that included seven PBC patients with a suboptimal response to UDCA treatment. UC-MSCs were first cultured, and then 0.5 \u00d7 10(6) cells/kg body weights were infused through a peripheral vein. UC-MSCs were given three times at 4-week intervals, and patients were followed up for 48 weeks. Primary outcomes were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of UC-MSC treatment, and secondary outcomes were to evaluate liver functions and patient's quality of life.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo obvious side-effects were found in the patients treated with UC-MSCs. Symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus were obviously alleviated in most patients after UC-MSC treatment. There was a significant decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels at the end of the follow-up period as compared with baseline. No significant changes were observed in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time activity, international normalized ratio, or immunoglobulin M levels. The Mayo risk score, a prognostic index, was also stable during the treatment and follow-up period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUC-MSC transfusion is feasible and well tolerated in patients with PBC who respond only partially to UDCA treatment, thus representing a novel therapeutic approach for patients in this subgroup. A larger, randomized controlled cohort study is warranted to confirm the clinical efficacy of UC-MSC transfusion.",

        "abstract": "Since the 1960s and the therapeutic use of hematopoietic stem cells of bone marrow origin, there has been an increasing interest in the study of undifferentiated progenitors that have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into various tissues. Stem cells (SC) with different potency can be isolated and characterised. Despite the promise of embryonic stem cells, in many cases, adult or even fetal stem cells provide a more interesting approach for clinical applications. It is undeniable that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from bone marrow, adipose tissue, or Wharton's Jelly are of potential interest for clinical applications in regenerative medicine because they are easily available without ethical problems for their uses. During the last 10 years, these multipotent cells have generated considerable interest and have particularly been shown to escape to allogeneic immune response and be capable of immunomodulatory activity. These properties may be of a great interest for regenerative medicine. Different clinical applications are under study (cardiac insufficiency, atherosclerosis, stroke, bone and cartilage deterioration, diabetes, urology, liver, ophthalmology, and organ's reconstruction). This review focuses mainly on tissue and organ regeneration using SC and in particular MSC.",

        "abstract": "Cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is expected to provide a new strategy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large amounts of MSCs can be obtained from human amnion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of transplantation of human amnion-derived MSCs (hAMSCs) or enema of conditioned medium (CM) from hAMSCs into rats with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. In the first experiment, 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were intravenously injected with hAMSCs (1 \u00d7 106 cells) 3 h after rectal administration of TNBS (45 mg/kg). In the second experiment, rats with TNBS-induced colitis received CM by enema into the colon for 3 days. Colitis was investigated by endoscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and by measuring mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators. Administration of hAMSCs or CM enema significantly improved the endoscopic score. In addition, these two interventions resulted in significantly decreased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and decreased expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL1, and CCL2. In conclusion, transplantation of hAMSCs and CM enema provided significant improvement in rats with TNBS-induced colitis. CM from hAMSCs and hAMSCs may be new strategies for the treatment of IBD.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, are present in almost all organs and tissues, including the amnion. Human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hAMSC) transplantation has been reported to ameliorate liver fibrosis in animal models. However, the mechanism for the prevention of liver fibrosis is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects, and underlying mechanisms, of a conditioned medium obtained from hAMSC cultures (hAMSC-CM) on a primary culture of rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We observed that in routine culture, hAMSC-CM in HSCs significantly inhibited the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), an activation marker of HSCs, and the production of collagen type 1 (COL1), a dominant component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the culture medium. In addition, hAMSC-CM upregulated the expression of ECM degradation-related genes, such as metalloproteinase- (Mmp-) 2, Mmp-9, Mmp-13, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- (Timp-) 1; however, it did not affect the expression of collagen type 1\u03b11 (Col1a1). These regulatory effects on HSCs were concentration-dependent. A cell proliferation assay indicated that hAMSC-CM significantly suppressed HSC proliferation and downregulated the expression of cyclin B (Ccnb), a proliferation-related gene. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) treatment further activated HSCs and hAMSC-CM significantly inhibited the upregulation of \u03b1-Sma and Col1a1 induced by TGF-\u03b2. These findings demonstrated that hAMSC-CM can modulate HSC function via secretory factors and provide a plausible explanation for the protective role of hAMSCs in liver fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) provides both structural support and dynamic microenvironment for cells regulating their behavior and fate. As a critical component of stem cell niche ECM maintains stem cells and activates their proliferation and differentiation under specific stimuli. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) regulate tissue-specific stem cell functions locating in their immediate microenvironment and producing various bioactive factors, including ECM components. We evaluated the ability of MSC-produced ECM to restore stem and progenitor cell microenvironment in vitro and analyzed the possible mechanisms of its effects. Human MSC cell sheets were decellularized by different agents (detergents, enzymes, and apoptosis inductors) to select the optimized combination (CHAPS and DNAse I) based on the conservation of decellularized ECM (dECM) structure and effectiveness of DNA removal. Prepared dECM was non-immunogenic, supported MSC proliferation and formation of larger colonies in colony-forming unit-assay. Decellularized ECM effectively promoted MSC trilineage differentiation (adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic) compared to plastic or plastic covered by selected ECM components (collagen, fibronectin, laminin). Interestingly, dECM produced by human fibroblasts could not enhance MSC differentiation like MSC-produced dECM, indicating cell-specific functionality of dECM. We demonstrated the significant integrin contribution in dECM-cell interaction by blocking the stimulatory effects of dECM with RGD peptide and suggested the involvement of key intracellular signaling pathways activation (pERK/ERK and pFAK/FAK axes, pYAP/YAP and beta-catenin) in the observed processes based on the results of inhibitory analysis. Taken together, we suppose that MSC-produced dECM may mimic stem cell niche components in vitro and maintain multipotent progenitor cells to insure their effective response to external differentiating stimuli upon activation. The obtained data provide more insights into the possible role of MSC-produced ECM in stem and progenitor cell regulation within their niches. Our results are also useful for the developing of dECM-based cell-free products for regenerative medicine.",

        "title": "Impact of Donor Age on the Osteogenic Supportive Capacity of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Matrix",
        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been proposed as an emerging cell-based therapeutic option for regenerative medicine applications as these cells can promote tissue and organ repair. In particular, MSC have been applied for the treatment of bone fractures. However, the healing capacity of these fractures is often compromised by patient\u2019s age. Therefore, considering the use of autologous MSC, we evaluated the impact of donor age on the osteogenic potential of bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC. MSC from older patients (60 and 80 years old) demonstrated impaired proliferative and osteogenic capacities compared to MSC isolated from younger patients (30 and 45 years old), suggesting that aging potentially changes the quantity and quality of MSC. Moreover, in this study, we investigated the capacity of the microenvironment [i.e., extracellular matrix (ECM)] to rescue the impaired proliferative and osteogenic potential of aged MSC. In this context, we aimed to understand if BM MSC features could be modulated by exposure to an ECM derived from cells obtained from young or old donors. When aged MSC were cultured on decellularized ECM derived from young MSC, their in vitro proliferative and osteogenic capacities were enhanced, which did not happen when cultured on old ECM. Our results suggest that the microenvironment, specifically the ECM, plays a crucial role in the quality (assessed in terms of osteogenic differentiation capacity) and quantity of MSC. Specifically, the aging of ECM is determinant of osteogenic differentiation of MSC. In fact, old MSC maintained on a young ECM produced higher amounts of extracellularly deposited calcium (9.10 \u00b1 0.22 vs. 4.69 \u00b1 1.41 \u03bcg.\u03bcl\u20131.10\u20137 cells for young ECM and old ECM, respectively) and up-regulated the expression of osteogenic gene markers such as Runx2 and OPN. Cell rejuvenation by exposure to a functional ECM might be a valuable clinical strategy to overcome the age-related decline in the osteogenic potential of MSC by recapitulating a younger microenvironment, attenuating the effects of aging on the stem cell niche. Overall, this study provides new insights on the osteogenic potential of MSC during aging and opens new possibilities for developing clinical strategies for elderly patients with limited bone formation capacity who currently lack effective treatments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Replicative senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) caused by repeated cell culture undermines their potential as a cell therapy because of the reduction in their proliferation and therapeutic potential. Glutaminase-1 (GLS1) is reported to be involved in the survival of senescent cells, and inhibition of GLS1 alleviates age-related dysfunction via senescent cell removal. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the association between MSC senescence and GLS1. We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the effect of GLS1 inhibition on senolysis and the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Inhibition of GLS1 in Wharton\u2019s jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) reduced the expression of aging-related markers, such as p16, p21, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype genes, by senolysis. Replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs, which recovered after short-term treatment with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES), showed increased proliferation and therapeutic effects compared to those observed with senescent WJ-MSCs. Moreover, compared to senescent WJ-MSCs, replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs inhibited apoptosis in serum-starved C2C12 cells, enhanced muscle formation, and hindered apoptosis and fibrosis in mdx mice. These results imply that GLS1 inhibition can ameliorate the therapeutic effects of senescent WJ-MSCs in patients with muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, GLS1 is a key factor in modulating the senescence mechanism of MSCs, and regulation of GLS1 may enhance the therapeutic effects of senescent MSCs, thereby increasing the success rate of clinical trials involving MSCs.",
