        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nGuidelines for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) from the American College of Chest Physicians do not address patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group with a high risk of both VTE and gastrointestinal bleeding. We present recommendations for the prevention and treatment of VTE in patients with IBD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on VTE in IBD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform, then finalized and voted on by a working group of adult and pediatric gastroenterologists and thrombosis specialists.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIBD patients have an approximately 3-fold higher risk of VTE compared with individuals without IBD, and disease flares further increase this risk. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended for IBD patients who are hospitalized with IBD flares without active bleeding and is suggested when bleeding is nonsevere. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is suggested during moderate-severe IBD flares in outpatients with a history of VTE provoked by an IBD flare or an unprovoked VTE, but not otherwise. The recommended duration of anticoagulation after a first VTE is based on the presence of provoking factors. Specific suggestions are made for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pediatric and pregnant IBD patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing the American College of Chest Physicians' guidelines as a foundation, we have integrated evidence from IBD studies to develop specific recommendations for the management of VTE in this high-risk population.",

        "title": "Therapeutic Applications of Curcumin Nanoformulations",
        "abstract": "Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a bioactive and major phenolic component of turmeric derived from the rhizomes of curcuma longa linn. For centuries, curcumin has exhibited excellent therapeutic benefits in various diseases. Owing to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin plays a significant beneficial and pleiotropic regulatory role in various pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inflammatory disorders, neurological disorders, and so on. Despite such phenomenal advances in medicinal applications, the clinical implication of native curcumin is hindered due to low solubility, physico-chemical instability, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and poor pharmacokinetics. However, these issues can be overcome by utilizing an efficient delivery system. Active scientific research was initiated in 2005 to improve curcumin\u2019s pharmacokinetics, systemic bioavailability, and biological activity by encapsulating or by loading curcumin into nanoform(s) (nanoformulations). A significant number of nanoformulations exist that can be translated toward medicinal use upon successful completion of pre-clinical and human clinical trials. Considering this perspective, current review provides an overview of an efficient curcumin nanoformulation for a targeted therapeutic option for various human diseases. In this review article, we discuss the clinical evidence, current status, and future opportunities of curcumin nanoformulation(s) in the field of medicine. In addition, this review presents a concise summary of the actions required to develop curcumin nanoformulations as pharmaceutical or nutraceutical candidates.",

        "title": "Delivery Systems in Wound Healing and Nanomedicine",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Delivery systems in nanomedicine contribute to the improvements in wound healing, tissue regeneration, and anticancer pharmacological fields. Although various wound dressings have been used in wound care treatments, there is a great challenge in the wound management of ulcers, trauma, chronic wounds, and severe injury and burns, especially infected wounds. Body: To accelerate wound healing, influence tissue repair, reduce scarring, and control infection, various delivery devices have been developed in wound healing. The application of delivery devices has improved early as well as long\u2010term wound care in delayed healing wounds. Main delivery systems are described, including drugs, bioactive proteins/growth factors, genes, and cells, outlining the advantages and limitations of each carrier in wound healing, as well as the mechanisms and release. This chapter reviews biomaterials and scaffolds that provide the carriers of bioactive agents, which include antimicrobial agents, combinations of cells, growth factors and genes, both scaffolds and cell interactions toward regeneration of skin tissues, vascular reconstructions, as well as transdermal carriers. In addition, the regulations, procedures, and clinical trails for delivery systems for wound healing are discussed. Conclusion: In the past decades, many wound dressings and skin substitutes have been developed to treat skin loss and wounds. Delivery systems can improve wound healing and tissue regeneration. Looking toward the future, the need for delivery wound healing products for chronic and complex wounds will increase. Functionalized delivery systems will probably be the academic interest and industrial focus on wound healing.",

        "abstract": "Chronic liver diseases represent a global health problem due to their high prevalence worldwide and the limited available curative treatment options. They can result from various causes, both infectious and noninfectious diseases. The application of nanoparticle (NP) systems has emerged as a rapidly evolving area of interest for the safe delivery of various drugs and nucleic acids for chronic liver diseases. This review presents the pathogenesis, diagnosis and the emerging nanoparticulate systems used in the treatment of chronic liver diseases caused by liver fibrosis. Activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is considered to be the main mechanism for liver fibrosis. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging techniques are widely used noninvasive diagnostic methods for hepatic fibrosis. A variety of nanoparticulate systems are mainly focused on targeting HSC in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. As early liver fibrosis is reversible by current NP therapy, it is being studied in preclinical as well as clinical trials. Among various nanoparticulate systems, inorganic NPs, liposomes and nanomicelles have been widely studied due to their distinct properties to deliver drugs as well as other therapeutic moieties. Liposomal NPs in clinical trials is considered to be a milestone in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. Currently, NP therapy for liver fibrosis is updating fast, and hopefully, it can be the future remedy for liver fibrosis.",

        "title": "Synergistic Antiproliferative Effects of Co-nanoencapsulated Curcumin and Chrysin on MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells Through Upregulating miR-132 and miR-502c",
        "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we explored whether co-nanoencapsulated Curcumin (Cur) and Chrysin (Chr), natural herbal compounds with antitumor activities, regulate miR-132 and miR-502c and their downstream targets, leading to the synergistic growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. For this purpose, Cur and Chr were co-encapsulated into PLGA-PEG nanoparticles (NPs) and characterized through DLS, FTIR and FE-SEM. MTT assay and cell cycle arrest analysis revealed that CurChr-loaded NPs had a considerable synergistic cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells with more cell accumulation in G2/M phase compared to the other groups. In addition, highest percentage of cell apoptosis was acquired in cells treated with CurChr-loaded NPs according to apoptosis analysis. Real-time PCR findings revealed that co-encapsulated form of Cur and Chr than free combination could further upregulate miR-132 and miR-502c expression (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Also, the strong reduction was detected in the protein levels of HN1 and P65 at the cells co-nanodelivered with Cur and Chr. These findings demonstrated that the co-nanodelivery of Cur and Chr through targeting miR-132 and miR-205c might be a novel strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacological profile of phytochemicals has attracted much attention to their use in disease therapy. Since cancer is a major problem for public health with high mortality and morbidity worldwide, experiments have focused on revealing the anti-tumor activity of natural products. Flavonoids comprise a large family of natural products with different categories. Chrysin is a hydroxylated flavonoid belonging to the flavone category. Chrysin has demonstrated great potential in treating different disorders, due to possessing biological and therapeutic activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, etc. Over recent years, the anti-tumor activity of chrysin has been investigated, and in the present review, we provide a mechanistic discussion of the inhibitory effect of chrysin on proliferation and invasion of different cancer cells. Molecular pathways, such as Notch1, microRNAs, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), PI3K/Akt, MAPK, etc., as targets of chrysin are discussed. The efficiency of chrysin in promoting anti-tumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents and suppressing drug resistance is described. Moreover, poor bioavailability, as one of the drawbacks of chrysin, is improved using various nanocarriers, such as micelles, polymeric nanoparticles, etc. This updated review will provide a direction for further studies in evaluating the anti-tumor activity of chrysin.",

        "abstract": "The present study is a mechanistic validation of \u2018proof-of-technology\u2019 for the effective topical delivery of chrysin nanoemulgel for localized, efficient treatment of melanoma-affected skin. Background: Currently available treatments for skin cancer are inefficient due to systemic side effects and poor transcutaneous permeation, thereby presenting a formidable challenge for the development of novel nanocarriers. Methods: We opted for a novel approach and formulated a nanocomplex system composed of hydrophobic chrysin dissolved in a lipid mix, which was further nanoemulsified in Pluronic\u00ae F-127 gel to enhance physicochemical and biopharmaceutic characteristics. Chrysin, a flavone extracted from passion flowers, exhibits potential anti-cancer activities; however, it has limited applicability due to its poor solubility. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the best self-nanoemulsifying region by varying the compositions of oil, Caproyl\u00ae 90 surfactant, Tween\u00ae 80, and co-solvent Transcutol\u00ae HP. Chrysin-loaded nanoemulsifying compositions were characterized for various physicochemical properties. Results: This thermodynamically stable, self-emulsifying drug delivery system showed a mean droplet size of 156.9 nm, polydispersity index of 0.26, and viscosity of 9100 cps after dispersion in gel. Mechanical characterization using Texture Analyzer exhibited that the gel had a hardness of 487 g and adhesiveness of 500 g. Ex vivo permeation through rat abdominal skin revealed significant improvement in percutaneous absorption measured as flux, the apparent permeability coefficient, the steady-state diffusion coefficient, and drug deposition. In vitro cytotoxicity on A375 and SK-MEL-2 cell lines showed a significantly improved therapeutic effect, thus ensuring reduction in dose. The safety of the product was established through biocompatibility testing on the L929 cell line. Conclusion: Aqueous, gel-based, topical, nanoemulsified chrysin is a promising technology approach for effective localized transcutaneous delivery that will help reduce the frequency and overall dose usage and ultimately improve the therapeutic index.",

        "abstract": "As regulatory and technical landscapes for pharmaceutical formulation development are rapidly evolving, a risk-management approach using multivariate analysis is highly essential for designing a product with requisite critical quality attributes (CQA). Efinaconazole, a newly approved poorly water-soluble antifungal triazole drug has poor permeability. Spanlastics, new-generation surfactant nanovesicles, being fluidic, help improve the permeability of drugs. Therefore, we optimized efinaconazole spanlastics using the concepts of Formulation-by-Design (FbD) and explored the feasibility of transungual delivery for the management of onychomycosis. Using the Ishikawa fishbone diagram, the risk factors that may have an impact on the CQA of efinaconazole spanlastic vesicles were identified. Application of the Plackett\u2013Burman experimental design facilitated the screening of eight different formulation and process parameters influencing particle size, transmittance, relative deformability, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and dissolution efficiency. With the help of Pareto charts, the three most significant factors were identified, viz., vesicle builder (Span), edge activator (Tween), and mixing time. The levels of these three critical variables were optimized by FbD to reduce the particle size and maximize the transparency, relative deformability, encapsulation efficiency, and dissolution efficiency of efinaconazole spanlastic nanovesicles. Bayesian and Lenth\u2019s analysis and mathematical modeling of the experimental data helped to quantify the critical formulation attributes required for getting the formulation with optimum quality features. The optimized efinaconazole-loaded spanlastic vesicles had a particle size of 197 nm, transparency of 91%, relative deformability of 12.5 min, and dissolution efficiency of 81.23%. The spanlastic formulation was incorporated into a gel and explored ex vivo for transungual delivery. This explorative study provides an example of the application of principles of risk management, statistical multivariate analysis, and the FbD approach in developing efinaconazole spanlastic nanovesicles.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of topical antifungal therapy in onychomycosis has been hindered by the failure of the antimycotic to permeate the nail plate. This research aims to design and develop a transungual system for the effective delivery of efinaconazole utilizing constant voltage iontophoresis. Seven prototype drug-loaded hydrogel formulations (E1\u2013E7) were prepared to assess the influence of solvent (ethanol) and cosolvent (Labrasol\u00ae) on transungual delivery. Optimization was performed to evaluate the effect of three independent variables; voltage, solvent-to-cosolvent ratio, and penetration enhancer (PEG 400) concentration on critical quality attributes (CQAs), such as drug permeation and loading into the nail. The selected hydrogel product was characterized for pharmaceutical properties, efinaconazole release from the nail, and antifungal activity. Preliminary data indicates ethanol, Labrasol\u00ae, and voltage influence the transungual delivery of efinaconazole. Optimization design indicates a significant impact by applied voltage (p-0.0001) and enhancer concentration (p-0.0004) on the CQAs. Excellent correlation between selected independent variables and CQAs was confirmed by the high desirability value (0.9427). A significant (p < 0.0001) enhancement in the permeation (~78.59 \u00b5g/cm2) and drug loading (3.24 \u00b5g/mg) was noticed in the optimized transungual delivery with 10.5 V. FTIR spectral data indicates no interaction between the drug and excipients, while the DSC thermograms confirmed the amorphous state of the drug in the formulation. Iontophoresis produces a drug depot in the nail that releases above the minimum inhibitory concentration level for an extended period, potentially reducing the need for frequent topical treatment. Antifungal studies further substantiate the release data and have shown remarkable inhibition of Trichophyton mentagrophyte. Overall, the promising results obtained here demonstrate the prospective of this non-invasive method for the effective transungual delivery of efinaconazole, which could improve the treatment of onychomycosis.",
