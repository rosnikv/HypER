        "abstract": "Nitric oxide is a ubiquitous estrogen-regulated signaling molecule that has been implicated in the regulation of bone maturation and remodeling. To better understand the role that bone-cell-secreted nitric oxide plays in ovariectomy-induced modifications of bone turnover, we examined the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in bone cells and bone progenitor cells at regular intervals up to 10 wk after acute estrogen deprivation. Ovariectomy led to an anticipated initial decline in bone cell eNOS production, but surprisingly, 17 d after ovariectomy, eNOS expression by bone and marrow stromal cells dramatically rebounded and was maintained at high levels for at least 10 wk after surgery. We examined the long-term consequences of eNOS in the process of ovariectomy-induced bone loss by prospectively analyzing bone mineral density in wild-type and eNOS(-/-) mice for 10 wk after ovariectomy. Ovariectomized eNOS(-/-) mice were observed to undergo an exaggerated state of estrogen-deficiency-induced bone remodeling compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that eNOS may act to mitigate this process. Furthermore, we found that whereas bone formation in estrogen-replete wild-type mice slowed between 14 and 20 wk of age, eNOS knockout mice continued to accrue basal bone mass at a high rate and showed no sign of entering a remodeling stage. Our data suggest that eNOS may play an important role in limiting ovariectomy-induced bone remodeling as well as regulating the transition from basal modeling to remodeling.",

        "abstract": "Bone metastasis is common in lung cancer patients and associated with reduced quality of life and reduced overall and median survival, so the early detection of bone metastasis and monitoring of its status is very important for clinicians. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin (OC), beta isomer of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were compared with regard to their usefulness as indicators of bone metastasis in lung cancer. The serum concentrations of the 4 markers were measured by commercially available tests in 96 male patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 30 male patients with other pulmonary diseases. The levels of both \u00e2-CTX and ICTP were significantly higher in 61 lung cancer patients with bone metastases than in 35 lung cancer patients without bone metastases (both p<0.001), and significantly correlated with the extent of bone disease. Although ICTP had a better sensitivity and accuracy than beta-CTX (75.4% vs 65.6% and 72.9% vs 68.8%, respectively), they had a similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.85 vs 0.83). These results support the use of beta-CTX and ICTP as an adjunct tool for the diagnosis and screening of bone metastasis in lung cancer.",

Primary outcome measure included clinical attachment levels (CAL) and secondary outcomes included probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), as well as gingival crevicular fluid bone marker assessment [collagen telopeptides (ICTP)]. These measurements were taken at baseline through 12 months post-surgery and drug administration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients treated with SDD and surgery demonstrated stronger reductions in PD in surgically-treated sites of >or=7 mm as well as gains in CAL (p<0.004). Furthermore, SDD+surgery resulted in short-term reductions in ICTP levels compared with placebo. Rebounds in ICTP levels and clinical parameters occurred when SDD was withdrawn.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results from this multi-centre study suggests that SDD in combination with surgery improves the short-term response of periodontal therapy by reducing PD, increasing CAL gain and inhibiting early stage bone resorption.",

        "abstract": "The role of heat shock proteins and anti-HSP 60/65 antibodies in atherogenesis has been widely described in the literature, but the participation of these molecules in the pathogenesis of diabetic macroangiopathy has not been extensively investigated. 30 patients with type 2 diabetes complicated with macroangiopathy of the lower extremities in the intermittent claudication stage. The control group (n=18) consisted of healthy volunteers of corresponding age. Levels of anti-HSP 60/65 antibodies, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and hsCRP in blood serum were measured. We also assessed static effort based on isometric contraction lasting until full fatigue. In patients with lower limb ischemia in diabetic macroangiopathy, a positive correlation between anti-HSP 60/65 antibodies and von Willebrand factor levels in blood serum was found (R=0.543, p<0.05). Concentrations of anti-HSP 60/65 antibodies were higher than in the control group, but not statistically significant (44.77\u00b155.00 vs. 26.09\u00b113.85; NS). The ongoing disease process contributed statistically significantly to the strength of the quadriceps muscle of the thigh (21.47 vs. 27.82 for the right limb, and 20.27 vs. 28.33 for the left limb; p<0.05). Increased concentrations of anti-HSP 60/65 antibodies in blood serum suggests their involvement in the pathogenesis of diabetic macroangiopathy and correlates with the parameters of endothelial cell damage.

        "title": "The influence of angiotensin-(1-7) peptidomimetic (AVE 0991) and nebivolol on angiotensin I metabolism in aorta of apoE-knockout mice.",
        "abstract": "The detrimental role of over activation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in atherogenesis is widely recognized. Recently, we have demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) peptidomimetic - AVE0991, as well as known beta-adrenolytic agent nebivolol, exert anti-atherogenic actions in mouse model of atherosclerosis - apoE-knockout mice. Here, using LC-ESI-MS ex vivo system, we tested whether prolonged treatment of apoE-knockout mice by these drugs can influence RAS in aorta of apoE-knockout mice in regard to generation of most active metabolites of Ang I-Ang II and Ang-(1-7). As compared to wild type animals there was increased generation of Ang II in aorta of apoE-knockout mice, while the formation of Ang-(1-7) did not differ between both groups. Either treatment with AVE0991 or nebivolol resulted in significant attenuation of Ang II production in aorta of apoE-knockout mice. In conclusion, for the first time we directly demonstrated that there is increase in ability of aortic tissue to generate Ang II in mouse model of atherosclerosis of apoE knockout mice, and that such effect could be efficiently attenuated either by treatment of nebivolol or Ang-(1-7) peptidomimetic - AVE0991. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for interference of both drugs with RAS require further investigation.",

        "title": "The renin-angiotensin system and its vasoactive metabolite angiotensin-(1-7) in the mechanism of the healing of preexisting gastric ulcers. The involvement of Mas receptors, nitric oxide, prostaglandins and proinflammatory cytokines.",
        "abstract": "The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or the blockade of angiotensin (Ang) AT-1 receptors affords protection against acute gastric mucosal injury, but whether the major metabolite of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), Ang-(1-7), accelerates the healing process of preexisting gastric ulcers remains unknown. Previous studies documented that Ang-(1-7) acting via its own Mas receptor exerts vascular responses opposing those of Ang II. We studied the effects of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis on the healing rate of acetic-acid-induced gastric ulcers with or without the blockade of Mas receptors by A 779 and compared it with the effects of activation and blockade of the AT-1 receptor by the treatment with Ang II and losartan, respectively, the inhibition of ACE by lisinopril, the NO/cNOS inhibition by L-NAME and inhibition of prostaglandin/COX system by indomethacin in the presence of Ang-(1-7). Additionally, ex vivo metabolism of Ang I in gastric tissue was assessed by LC/MS method. At day 9 after ulcer induction, the area of these ulcers and the accompanying changes in total gastric blood flow (GBF) were determined as were gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) at ulcer margin and gastric oxygen uptake (GVO2). The gastric mucosal expression of mRNAs for constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and plasma level of both cytokines were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. The 9 days treatment with Ang II dose-dependently increased the area of gastric ulcers and this effect was accompanied by a significant fall in the GBF, GVO2 and GMBF at ulcer margin. In contrast, treatment with Ang-(1-7) which produced a significant rise in the luminal content of NO significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcer and significantly increased the GBF, GVO2 and the GMBF at ulcer margin. Similar GMBF changes and significant reduction the area of gastric ulcer was observed in rats with gastric ulcers treated with the agonist of Mas receptor, AVE 0991. These effects of Ang-(1-7) and AVE 0991 were eliminated by blockade of the Mas receptor with A779. Similarly to Ang-(1-7), treatment with losartan or lisinopril significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcers and the accompanying increase in the GMBF at ulcer margin and these effects were significantly attenuated by a concomitant administration of L-NAME and indomethacin. The rate of healing of ulcers was associated with a decrease in ex vivo Ang-(1-7) formation and this effect was attenuated by lisinopril. The treatment with Ang-(1- 7) or AVE 0991 increased the expression of mRNA for cNOS and SOD and downregulated that of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 followed by the decrease in the plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. We conclude that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor system accelerates the healing of preexisting gastric ulcers via an increase in the gastric macro- and microcirculations, and an increase in gastric tissue oxygenation. These effects are mediated by PG and NO derived from overexpression of cNOS, an increase in the expression of antioxidizing enzyme SOD 2 and an anti-inflammatory action involving the inhibition of expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Our results seem to underlie the importance of the Ang-(1-7), AT-1 and Mas receptors in the regulation of local vascular and metabolic effects associated with mechanism of gastric ulcer healing.",

        "abstract": "Objective The present study was designed to evaluate the possible gastroprotective effects of different doses of azilsartan in ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats. Methodology Forty-eight male adult Wistar rats were used and allocated randomly into four groups: negative control treated with distilled water, positive control treated with ethanol, lansoprazole treated group, and azilsartan (1mg, 5mg, and 10mg/kg) treated group. The treatment protocol was for 15 days, and all the groups except for the negative control group received 1mL of ethanol on the last day 1hr before scarification. Gastric content was collected for measuring the volume, free acidity, and pH. The stomach was used for measuring the gastric lesion area and ulcer index. Blood samples were collected for measuring serum hydroxyproline, gastrin, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, MDA, and TAOC. Gastric tissues were sent for histopathological examinations. Results Ethanol administration significantly increased gastric lesion, gastric ulcer index, and gastric acidity. Ethanol also decreased serum levels of hydroxyproline and TAOC and increased serum gastrin, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA. Azilsartan 10mg/kg was able to decrease the lesion by 43.6% and increase gastric pH and significantly decreased MDA level. Both 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg azilsartan have successfully restored the level of hydroxyproline, gastrin, and TNF-\u03b1. The histopathological finding showed gastroprotection by azilsartan in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion The study revealed that azilsartan possesses a gastroprotective effect. The proposed mechanisms could be increased blood flow to the stomach, antioxidant capacity, and anti-inflammatory activity along with restoring hydroxyproline and gastrin levels. These findings suggest azilsartan as a promising candidate to be tested in a clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "Azilsartan, a known angiotensin receptor blocker, has shown potential in reducing 24-hour blood pressure and may have protective effects against cardiac complications. Increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue is directly related to the cardiac complications of doxorubicin. This study investigated whether azilsartan could mitigate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. We divided 28 male rats into four groups: the control group receiving a standard diet and water, the vehicle group given DMSO orally for two weeks, doxorubicin group receiving 2.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin three times a week for two weeks, and azilsartan group treated with 5 mg/kg/day of azilsartan orally and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was evidenced by a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MDA, and caspase-3 levels and significantly decreased TAC and Bcl-2 levels in the cardiac tissues of treated rats compared to the DMSO and control groups. Azilsartan significantly decreased doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by a decline in serum levels of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Additionally, MDA significantly decreased in the cardiac tissue, although TAC was significantly increased when comparing the azilsartan group to the group receiving doxorubicin-only. These results suggest that azilsartan effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, likely by mitigating apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in cardiac tissues.",

IRI causes Oxidative damage, inflammation, and cell death. Autophagy, which recycles cytoplasmic components and breaks them down into smaller pieces, may have a role in cell death or survival in certain pathological states. Objective: Through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic actions, as well as activation of the autophagy system, this study explores the potential nephroprotective benefits of trandolapril against renal ischemia-reperfusion damage. Material and method: There were four groups of rats used in this study: sham, RIRI, Dimethyl sulfoxide, and Trandolapril pretreated groups. The sham group underwent the same anesthesia and surgical procedures except for ischemia. Other groups undergo bilateral renal ischemia for 30 minutes and then reperfusion for 24 hours. DMSO group vehicle for trandolapril and trandolapril group 0.3mg/kg given 2 hours before ischemia induction. Results: The study found that blood urea and serum creatinine levels increased in the RIRI and DMSO groups when compared with the sham group. Renal tissue levels of IL-6, Kim-1, caspase-3, LC-3, and Akt were also elevated in RIRI while GSH levels decreased in the RIRI. The Trandolapril group showed significant increases in GSH, LC-3, and Akt levels when compared to the sham group.
