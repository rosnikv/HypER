        "abstract": "AIMS\nThe aim of this study was to assess the effects of pre-operative statin therapy on cardiovascular events in the first 30-days after non-cardiac surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe conducted an international, prospective, cohort study of patients who were \u226545 years having in-patient non-cardiac surgery. We estimated the probability of receiving statins pre-operatively using a multivariable logistic model and conducted a propensity score analysis to correct for confounding. A total of 15 478 patients were recruited at 12 centres in eight countries from August 2007 to January 2011. The matched population consisted of 2845 patients (18.4%) treated with a statin and 4492 (29.0%) controls. The pre-operative use of statins was associated with lower risk of the primary outcome, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS), or stroke at 30 days [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.95; P = 0.007]. Statins were also associated with a significant lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.83; P = 0.003), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.76; P = 0.004), and MINS (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73-0.98; P = 0.02). There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, pre-operative statin therapy was independently associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes at 30 days. These results require confirmation in a large randomized trial.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinical Trials.gov NCT00512109.",

        "abstract": "Background: The effect on cardiovascular outcomes of withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic users before noncardiac surgery is unknown. Methods: In this international prospective cohort study, the authors analyzed data from 14,687 patients (including 4,802 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker users) at least 45 yr old who had in-patient noncardiac surgery from 2007 to 2011. Using multivariable regression models, the authors studied the relationship between withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and a primary composite outcome of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery at 30 days, with intraoperative and postoperative clinically important hypotension as secondary outcomes. Results: Compared to patients who continued their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, the 1,245 (26%) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker users who withheld their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the 24\u2009h before surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury (150/1,245 [12.0%] vs. 459/3,557 [12.9%]; adjusted relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = 0.01) and intraoperative hypotension (adjusted relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93; P < 0.001). The risk of postoperative hypotension was similar between the two groups (adjusted relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.10; P = 0.36). Results were consistent across the range of preoperative blood pressures. The practice of withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers was only modestly correlated with patient characteristics and the type and timing of surgery. Conclusions: Withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers before major noncardiac surgery was associated with a lower risk of death and postoperative vascular events. A large randomized trial is needed to confirm this finding. In the interim, clinicians should consider recommending that patients withhold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers 24\u2009h before surgery.",

        "title": "Bronchial Blocker Use in the Difficult Airway Patient Requiring Lung Isolation: Clarification as to What Blockers Are Actually Available.",
        "abstract": "To the Editor The recent narrative review by Collins et al 1 outlining the various lung isolation techniques available for patients with a difficult airway makes particular note of bronchial blocker use where placing a conventional double-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) might otherwise be difficult. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that a singlelumen ETT would not offer a significant advantage over of double-lumen ETT in this situation. Unquestionably, the use of video laryngoscopy with a single-lumen ETT has changed the landscape of difficult airway management, and this certainly extends to situations where it can be combined with a bronchial blocker. Their otherwise very informative article includes a photograph (noted as their Figure 1) of the various commercially available bronchial blockers. Notably, the Arndt endobronchial blocker system (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) depicted in the image has an elliptically shaped occlusion balloon. However, this particular elliptical blocker has not been commercially available since 2010; the currently available Arndt endobronchial blocker (model C-AES-9.0-78-SPH-AS) actually has a spherically shaped balloon. Although this does not change the usefulness of this bronchial blocker system for lung isolation, a clear and accurate representation of the currently available blockers is nonetheless important.",

        "abstract": "The elderly patient presenting with an acute surgical abdomen or bowel obstruction has become a common and challenging situation. These patients bring comorbidity and frailty that necessitate appropriate risk assessment and comprehensive perioperative management. Robust communication is required between patients, families and health professions. The Australia and New Zealand Emergency Laparotomy Audit-Quality Improvement (ANZELA-QI) study is based on the United Kingdom's National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) and will gather large scale data, providing hospital-level information to enable clinicians to reduce variation in management. Successful management of the elderly laparotomy patient requires close coordination between surgeons, anaesthetists and physicians. The ANZELA-QI study will help establish the role of collaborative models of care and the need for perioperative care teams.",

        "title": "Withholding vs. Continuing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers Before Non-cardiac Surgery in Older Patients: Study Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial",
        "abstract": "Background: Older hypertensive adults are at increased risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. As first line antihypertensive drug therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have many beneficial effects. However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs in the perioperative period remains controversial. This study aims to determine the effects of withholding vs. continuing ACEIs/ARBs before non-cardiac surgery on perioperative hypotension and postoperative outcomes in older patients. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a total of 2036 patients aged 60\u201380 years undergoing non-cardiac surgical procedures will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral ACEIs/ARBs (the ACEIs/ARBs continued group) or inactive placebos (the ACEIs/ARBs withheld group) on the morning of surgery. For both groups, the ACEIs/ARBs will be continued from the first postoperative day. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of perioperative hypotensive events, defined as mean blood pressure (MBP) < 65 mmHg or \u226530% reduction in MBP from baseline during surgery and in a post-anesthesia care unit. The secondary outcomes include duration of perioperative hypotension, intraoperative use of fluids and vasopressors, hypotensive events within postoperative 3 days, and perioperative neurocognitive disorders, major adverse cardiocerebral events (a composite outcome of stroke, coma, myocardial infarction, heart block, and cardiac arrest), and mortality within 30 days after surgery. Discussion: The results of this trial will offer an evidence-based perioperative ACEIs/ARBs therapy for older hypertensive adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Study Registration: This study is approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Approval No. 2020-077-1) and by the institutional ethics review board of each participating center. This protocol is registered at the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (ChiCTR2000039376).",

        "abstract": "Introduction Post-induction hypotension (PIH) is a common event in elderly surgical patients and is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. This study aims to develop and validate a PIH prediction model for elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery to identify potential PIH in advance and help to take preventive measures. Methods and analysis A total of 938 elderly surgical patients (n=657 for development and internal validation, n=281 for temporal validation) will be continuously recruited at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China. The main outcome is PIH during the first 15\u2009min after anaesthesia induction or before skin incision (whichever occurs first). We select candidate predictors based on published literature, professional knowledge and clinical expertise. For model development, we will use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and multivariable logistic regression. For internal validation, we will apply the bootstrapping technique. After model development and internal validation, temporal validation will be conducted in patients recruited in another time period. We will use the discrimination, calibration and max-rescaled Brier score in the temporal validation cohort. Furthermore, the clinical utility of the prediction model will be assessed using the decision curve analysis, and the results will be presented in a nomogram and a web-based risk calculator. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Approval No. 2023-012). This PIH risk prediction model will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration number ChiCTR2200066201.",
