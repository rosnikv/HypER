        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNo therapy has been shown to reliably prevent the evolution of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

        "title": "Wireless capsule endoscopy and small intestine contrast ultrasonography in recurrence of Crohn's disease",
        "abstract": "Background: The best available tool to assess recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) is ileocolonoscopy (CC). Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) are noninvasive techniques able to detect small bowel lesions. In a prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the usefulness of SICUS and WCE for assessing postoperative recurrence of CD 1 year after surgery, using CC as the gold standard. Methods: Twenty\u2010two patients (11 men, median age 33 years, range 22\u201367 years) undergoing ileocolonic resection for CD were prospectively followed from July 2003 to May 2006, with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) used for clinical assessment every 3 months for 1 year. At 1 year, recurrence was assessed by SICUS and CC, followed by WCE. CD recurrence was assessed by CC (Rutgeerts score). SICUS was performed after ingestion of polyethylene glycol, and WCE was performed with Given M2A equipment. Results: At 1 year, all 22 patients had inactive CD (CDAI < 150). In 5 patients, WCE was not performed because of luminal narrowing or stenosis. Seventeen of the 22 patients had all 3 techniques performed. CC detected recurrence in 21 of 22 patients. Lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 22 patients (1 false positive). When considering only the 17 patients studied by all 3 techniques, recurrence was detected by CC in 16 of 17 patients, whereas lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 17 patients (16 true positives [TPs], 1 FP) and by WCE in 16 of 17 patients (16 TPs, 1 true negative). Conclusions: The present findings suggest that SICUS and WCE may be used as noninvasive techniques for the assessment of recurrence of CD in patients being regularly followed up after ileocolonic resection.

        "abstract": "The majority of patients with Crohn's disease require surgery for disease-related complications. Postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence is common after intestinal resection. The optimal management strategy for postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease is controversial. In the absence of universally adopted guidelines, clinicians and patients must discuss and weigh the risks and benefits of postoperative pharmacotherapy. Those patients at low risk of disease recurrence may not require treatment. On the other hand, patients with more aggressive disease and high risk of recurrence may be best treated early in the postoperative period with an immunomodulator or antitumor necrosis factor agents. Ideally, postoperative treatment decisions would be made using predictable, reliable, and reproducible clinical prediction criteria that would guide treatment. This article reviews the data on postoperative Crohn's disease, including predictors of early recurrence, available options for postoperative monitoring, timing of initiation, and choice of postoperative therapy for prevention and management.",

        "title": "Diagnostics in inflammatory bowel disease: ultrasound.",
        "abstract": "Diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging data. Imaging of the morphological characteristics of IBD includes the assessment of mucosal alterations, transmural involvement and extraintestinal manifestations. No single imaging technique serves as a diagnostic gold standard to encompass all disease manifestations. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow cross-sectional imaging of the transmural alterations and extraintestinal manifestations. While in the USA the technique of choice is CT, in Europe the focus is more on MRI and ultrasound (US). Most patients with chronic IBD are diagnosed at a young age. After baseline diagnosis many of these young patients have to undergo repetitive imaging procedures during the variable clinical course of the disease, characterized by alternate periods of remission and active disease, and in monitoring the response to treatment. US has the advantage of being noninvasive, less costly, and easily repeatable, and thus can be very useful in following up patients with IBD. In addition, rising concern about radiation exposure in young adults indicates the demand for radiation-sparing techniques like US and MRI. This article focuses on the current clinical practice of US in IBD, describing the current technologies used in transabdominal intestinal US and the characteristic sonographic findings in Crohn\u00b4s disease and ulcerative colitis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review Imaging the gut provides information on Crohn's disease activity, identifies complications and provides insight into patient symptoms. Imaging can help direct therapy and can predict important patient outcomes. In a rapidly changing, technology-driven field, new imaging applications add novel insights that we are only beginning to appreciate. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in imaging as they are applied to the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. Recent findings In the past year, key literature describing cross-sectional imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) based imaging, specifically CT enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), transcutaneous ultrasound, and PET-based imaging, has emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease. MRI sequences that have been recently applied to Crohn's disease assessment, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), add important new insights. These new data highlight the current status of available imaging modalities and provide a glimpse into the future of our practice. Summary CTE and MRE are our new standard imaging modalities for small bowel Crohn's disease. PET scanning is promising but currently only used routinely in centers with a strong research presence in this area. Ultrasound is emerging as a useful, potentially less costly, radiation-free technique. New MRI sequences offer future promise for effectively monitoring the natural history of Crohn's disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe primary objective of our study was to examine the association between contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) parameters and established gray-scale ultrasound with color Doppler imaging (CDI) for the determination of disease activity in patients with Crohn disease. Our secondary objective was to develop quantitative time-signal intensity curve thresholds for disease activity.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nOne hundred twenty-seven patients with Crohn disease underwent ultrasound with CDI and CEUS. Reviewers graded wall thickness, inflammatory fat, and mural blood flow as showing remission or inflammation (mild, moderate, or severe). If both gray-scale ultrasound and CDI predicted equal levels of disease activity, the studies were considered concordant. If ultrasound images suggested active disease not supported by CDI findings, the ultrasound results for disease activity were indeterminate. Time-signal intensity curves from CEUS were acquired with calculation of peak enhancement (PE), and AUCs. Interobserver variation and associations between PE and ultrasound parameters were examined. Multiclass ROC analysis was used to develop CEUS thresholds for activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-six (76%) studies were concordant, 19 of which showed severe disease, and 31 (24%) studies were indeterminate. Kappa analyses revealed good interobserver agreement on grades for CDI (\u03ba = 0.76) and ultrasound (\u03ba = 0.80) assessments. PE values on CEUS and wall thickness showed good association with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for the entire population (\u03c1 = 0.62, p < 0.01) and for the concordant group (\u03c1 = 0.70, p < 0.01). Multiclass ROC analyses of the concordant group using wall thickness alone as the reference standard showed cutoff points of 18.2 dB for differentiating mild versus moderate activity (sensitivity, 89.0% and specificity, 87.0%) and 23.0 dB for differentiating moderate versus severe (sensitivity, 90% and specificity, 86.8%). Almost identical cutoff points were observed when using ultrasound global assessment as the reference standard: using 18.2 dB to differentiate mild versus moderate activity yielded sensitivity of 89.2% and specificity of 90.9% and using 22.9 dB to differentiate moderate versus severe activity yielded sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 83.1%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nQuantitative CEUS parameters integrated into inflammatory assessments with ultrasound reduce indeterminate results and improve disease activity level determinations.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims\nIncreased small intestinal wall thickness correlates with both inflammatory activity and fibrosis in Crohn's disease [CD]. Assessment of perfusion holds promise as an objective marker distinguishing between the two conditions. Our primary aim was to determine if relative bowel wall perfusion measurements correlate with histopathological scores for inflammation or fibrosis in CD.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 25 patients were investigated before elective surgery for small intestinal CD. Unenhanced ultrasonography [US] and magnetic resonance enterography [MRE] were applied to describe bowel wall thickness. Perfusion was assessed with contrast-enhanced US [CEUS] and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRE [DCE-MRE]. Histopathology was used as gold standard.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with histopathology, the mean wall thickness was 0.4 mm greater on US [range -0.3 to 1.0, p = 0.24] and 1.4 mm greater on MR [0.4 to 2.3, p = 0.006]. No correlation was found between the severity of inflammation or fibrosis on histopathology, and either DCE-MRE [r = -0.13, p = 0.54 for inflammation and r = 0.41, p = 0.05 for fibrosis] or CEUS [r = 0.16, p = 0.45 for inflammation and r = -0.28, p = 0.19 for fibrosis]. Wall thickness assessed with US was correlated with both histological inflammation [r = 0.611, p = 0.0012] and fibrosis [r = 0.399, p = 0.048]. The same was not true for MR [r = 0.41, p = 0.047 for inflammation and r = 0.29, p = 0.16 for fibrosis].\n\n\nConclusions\nBowel wall thickness assessed with US is a valid marker of inflammation in small intestinal CD.

Bowel fibrosis was histologically classified as none-mild or moderate-severe. In the training cohort, 1454 radiomic features were extracted from venous-phase CTE, and a machine learning-based RM was developed based on the reproducible features using logistic regression. The RM was validated in an independent external test cohort recruited from three centres. The diagnostic performance of RM was compared with two radiologists' visual interpretation of CTE using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RM for distinguishing moderate-severe from none-mild intestinal fibrosis was 0.888 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.818-0.957).
