        "abstract": "For decades sulphasalazine has been the only valuable non-corticosteroid drug in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Then Truelove et al showed that the pharmacologically active moiety in sulphasalazine for the treatment of this disease was 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).' This resulted in new 5-ASA formulations for topical and oral use. 5-ASA enemas and suppositories seem to have the same efficacy as topical corticosteroids in active distal ulcerative colitis.2 3 Sulphasalazine is not as effective as corticosteroids for the treatment of widespread active disease, and there is no evidence that any of the newer salicylates is better in this respect.4 Because extensive, active ulcerative colitis must be treated aggressively so that it does not become severe and require surgery, systemic corticosteroids are always the first alternative in these cases. Maintenance treatment is therefore the main indication for oral use of sulphasalazine and the new salicylates in ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis was unable to show that any of the new salicylates was more efficient than sulphasalazine.4 There are three factors to consider when choosing which drug to use: (1) effectiveness; (2) which formulation delivers 5-ASA to the colon with the fewest systemic effects; and (3) safety. The formulations and sites of 5-ASA release of various new 5-ASA based drugs are shown in the Table.",

        "abstract": "This study quantified and characterised changes to a species level for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from colonic biopsies of acute ulcerative colitis (UC) comparing them with that of a normal control group. Fresh endoscopic biopsies of the recto\u2013sigmoid region were obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy from 10 patients suffering an acute attack of UC and a similar number of healthy controls. Quantitative estimation was carried out on selective media for total aerobic, anaerobic, Bacteroides , Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. (Miles\u2013Misra). Species identification involved gram stain, indole, catalase tests and commercially validated anaerobic, gram-positive and non-enteric fermenting enzyme hydrolysis kits. There was a significant quantitative decrease in growth of Lactobacillus spp. in colitic biopsies (p<0.05). Total aerobic speciation revealed 32 different sub-species with 18 of these found only in UC biopsies. Anaerobic speciation revealed 41 different sub-species with a mean 6.7 species in normal and 4.7 in UC patients. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was isolated in significantly increased frequency in UC biopsies (8:10) in comparison with normal (4:10). Our data are consistent with the possibility that a reduction in mucosally associated Lactobacillus bacteria in UC permits proliferation of a large number of potentially pathogenic aerobic species and anaerobic predominance of B. thetaiotaomicron .

        "title": "Identification of Probiotics and Prebiotics with Antiallergenic Properties",
        "abstract": "Probiotics have been defined as bacterial preparations which impart clinically verified beneficial health effects on the host when consumed orally. Prebiotics are nonabsorbable carbohydrates which act by promoting beneficial members of intestinal microbiota in a manner that provides demonstrated health benefits to humans [1]. Most probiotics are currently either lactic acid bacteria or bifidobacteria, but new species and genera are being assessed for probiotic use. Common prebiotics are based on fructo-oligosaccharides from plant sources or lactose-based galacto-oligosaccharides resembling those found in breast milk [1]. Current knowledge of probiotics and prebiotics shows that mechanisms of probiotic action are multi-facetted and each probiotic or prebiotic may have specific functions affecting the host. The criteria for effective probiotics were defined based on the general properties of probiotics. It may be necessary to redefine these criteria and acquire new standards to allow the development of probiotics for specific functions and targets [2]. The same is required for prebiotics as most of them were developed as substrates for intestinal bifidobacteria in general without understanding their role in microbiota\u2013host interactions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is able to bind the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and thus potentially restrict its rapid absorption from the intestine. In this study we investigated the potential of GG to reduce AFB1 availability in vitro in Caco-2 cells adapted to express cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, such that both transport and toxicity could be assessed. Caco-2 cells were grown as confluent monolayers on transmembrane filters for 21 days prior to all studies. AFB1 levels in culture medium were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. In CYP 3A4-induced monolayers, AFB1 transport from the apical to the basolateral chamber was reduced from 11.1% \u00b1 1.9% to 6.4% \u00b1 2.5% (P = 0.019) and to 3.3% \u00b1 1.8% (P = 0.002) within the first hour in monolayers coincubated with GG (1 \u00d7 1010 and 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml, respectively). GG (1 \u00d7 1010 and 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml) bound 40.1% \u00b1 8.3% and 61.0% \u00b1 6.0% of added AFB1 after 1 h, respectively. AFB1 caused significant reductions of 30.1% (P = 0.01), 49.4% (P = 0.004), and 64.4% (P < 0.001) in transepithelial resistance after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Coincubation with 1 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml GG after 24 h protected against AFB1-induced reductions in transepithelial resistance at both 24 h (P = 0.002) and 48 h (P = 0.04). DNA fragmentation was apparent in cells treated only with AFB1 cells but not in cells coincubated with either 1 \u00d7 1010 or 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml GG. GG reduced AFB1 uptake and protected against both membrane and DNA damage in the Caco-2 model. These data are suggestive of a beneficial role of GG against dietary exposure to aflatoxin.",

        "abstract": "Our previous studies have selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with antifungal activities from traditional fermented foods made from cassava (G7) and silage feed palm leaf (PDS5 and PDS3). In this study we evaluated their ability to bind aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and probiotic characteristic. The probiotic characteristic assays of LAB consisted of resistance to acidic conditions (pH 3), gastric juice and bile salts 0.3%. We also carried out an in vitro evaluation of LAB aflatoxin binding ability in viable and non-viable cell for 24 and 48 hours of incubation. The measurement of aflatoxin content was performed by ELISA method using AgraQuant Total Aflatoxin Assay kit. The results showed that all isolates were potential as probiotics and the G7 isolate had the highest viability among other isolates in pH 3 (92.61 %) and the bile salts assay (97.71 %). The percentage of aflatoxin reduction between viable and non-viable cell from each LAB isolate were different. The highest aflatoxin reduction in viable cell assay was performed by G7 isolate (69.11 %) whereas in non-viable cell assay was performed by PDS3 isolate (73.75 %) during incubation time 48 hours. In this study, G7 isolate performed the best probiotic characteristics with the highest viability in acid pH assay, bile salt 0.3% assay and percentage of aflatoxin B1 reduction in viable cell condition. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that G7 isolate had homology with Lactobacillus plantarum (99.9%). It was concluded that Lactobacillus plantarum G7 was potential as probiotic with aflatoxin binding activities.",

        "abstract": "The equine hindgut ecosystem is specialized in dietary fibers\u2019 fermentation to provide horses\u2019 energy and contribute to its health. Nevertheless, antibiotics are known to disrupt the hindgut microbiota, affecting the fibrolytic activity of bacteria and the intestinal immune balance, leading to diseases. This in vivo study used a general and comprehensive approach for characterizing the hindgut ecosystem of 9 healthy horses over 28 days in response to a 5-day challenge with oral trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (TMS), with a special emphasis on microbial fibrolytic activity and the host immune response. Horses were supplemented with two doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Ligilactobacillus salivarius (formerly L. salivarius), and Bifidobacterium lactis blend or a placebo in a 3 \u00d7 3 Latin square design. Changes in fecal microbiota were investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clostridioides difficile was quantified in feces using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Anaerobic microbiological culture was used to enumerate functional bacterial groups (cellulolytic, amylolytic, and lactic acid-utilizing). The environmental dimensions were assessed by measuring the concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and lactic acid using biochemical methods, and changes in pH and dry matter weight. Systemic and local inflammation was evaluated by determination of cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)A concentrations in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) concentrations in the feces using immuno-enzymatic methods. Oral TMS treatment strongly altered the whole hindgut ecosystem by 2 days after the first administration. Bacterial diversity decreased in proportion to the relative abundance of fibrolytic genera, which coincided with the decrease in the concentration of cellulolytic bacteria. At the same time, the composition of microbiota members was reorganized in terms of relative abundances, probably to support the alteration in fibrolysis. C. difficile DNA was not found in these horses, but the relative abundances of several potential pathobiont genera increased. 2 days after the first TMS administration, fecal concentrations of VFAs and SIgA increased in parallel with fecal water content, suggesting an alteration of the integrity of the hindgut mucosa. Recovery in bacterial composition, functions, and immune biomarkers took 2\u20139 days after the end of TMS administration. Supplementation with this bacterial blend did not limit bacterial alteration but might have interesting mucosal immunomodulatory effects.",

Make-up of the bacterial gut population was assessed, as well as indicators of manure quality. The PBP + AB group had a significantly different population of bacteria in their manure compared with all other groups. Most of the differences were found in bacterial populations that function to degrade fiber, including Fibrobacter and Ruminococcaceae. The Fibrobacter population was significantly higher in AB and PBP + AB horses than Control. For Ruminococcaceae, Control was significantly higher than AB and PBP during antibiotic treatment, and PBP + AB horses were significantly higher than PBP horses after antibiotic treatment.
