        "title": "Technical Considerations and Patient Comfort in Total Colonoscopy with and without a Transparent Cap: Initial Experiences from a Pilot Study",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS\nEven though colonoscopy was introduced 30 years ago, endoscopists still leave a small percentage of the colonic mucosal surface unexamined because of the limitations of the procedure, so there is still room for technical improvements. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of attaching a transparent cap to the tip of the colonoscope, partly to gather basic data and experience for planning a larger randomized study, and partly to evaluate any technical advantages or disadvantages, and also to appraise the patients' experiences.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn 50 consecutive patients examined by a single experienced endoscopist, a prospective pilot study was carried out comparing the use of a colonoscope fitted with a transparent cap (in half of the colonoscopies) with the use of an ordinary colonoscope without a cap (in the remaining 25 patients). The following parameters were recorded: indication for colonoscopy, time to reach the cecum, total time for the colonoscopy, findings, diagnosis, type of colonoscopy (diagnostic or therapeutic, partial or total, ileal intubation), the amount of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy, and complications. At the end of the examination and also before leaving the hospital, the patients were asked by a nurse to estimate pain experienced during the colonoscopy, using a visual analogue scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time for the procedure, the ability to perform a complete colonoscopy (including ileal intubation when it was medically relevant), and the complication rate turned out to be similar in both groups. There were no differences between the amounts of analgesia and sedation given during the endoscopy or between the patients' estimations of the pain experienced.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe time to reach the cecum and the total time for the colonoscopy is the same with or without the cap, which is well tolerated by patients. Using the cap greatly facilitates the possibility of finding small polyps behind folds in the colon, because the folds can be straightened, thereby improving the view, although in this small pilot study it could not be proven that the number of polyps found was greater using a cap-fitted colonoscope.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Colonoscopy, the \u201cgold standard\u201d screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC), has known diagnostic limitations. Advances in endoscope technology have focused on improving mucosal visualisation. In addition to increased angle of view and resolution features, recent colonoscopes have non-white-light optics, such as narrow band imaging (NBI), to enhance image contrast. We aimed to study the neoplasia diagnostic characteristics of NBI, by comparing the neoplasm miss rate when the colonoscopy was performed under NBI versus white light (WL). Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: US Veterans hospital. Patients: Elective colonoscopy adults. Intervention: We randomly assigned patients to undergo a colonoscopic examination using NBI or WL. All patients underwent a second examination using WL, as the reference standard. Main outcome measures: The primary end point was the difference in the neoplasm miss rate, and secondary outcome was the neoplasm detection rate. Results: In 276 tandem colonoscopy patients, there was no significant difference of miss or detection rates between NBI or WL colonoscopy techniques. Of the 135 patients in the NBI group, 17 patients (12.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5 to 19.4%) had a missed neoplasm, as compared with 17 of the 141 patients (12.1%; 95% CI 7.2 to 18.6%) in the WL group, with a miss rate risk difference of 0.5% (95% CI \u22127.2 to 8.3). 130 patients (47%) had at least one neoplasm. Missed lesions with NBI showed similar characteristics to those missed with WL. All missed neoplasms were tubular adenomas, the majority (78%) was \u2a7d5 mm and none were larger than 1 cm (one-sided 95% CI up to 1%). Nonpolypoid lesions represented 35% (13/37) of missed neoplasms. Interpretation: NBI did not improve the colorectal neoplasm miss rate compared to WL; the miss rate for advanced adenomas was less than 1% and for all adenomas was 12%. The neoplasm detection rates were similar high using NBI or WL; almost a half the study patients had at least one adenoma. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00628147",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background\u2002To improve detection of mucosal lesions during colonoscopy a number of imaging modalities have been suggested, including high definition and virtual chromoendoscopy. Given the theoretical advantage of these new imaging techniques, we aimed to investigate their use for the detection of polyps in patients referred for colonoscopy in a large tertiary hospital. Methods\u2002Demographic, endoscopic, and histological data from 1855 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy were collected prospectively. Patients were randomly assigned to three endoscopy systems (Fujinon, Olympus, or Pentax) in combination with four modalities: conventional white-light colonoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a505), high definition white-light colonoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a582), virtual chromoendoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a285) and high definition virtual chromoendoscopy (n\u200a=\u200a483). Results\u2002The mean adenoma detection rate (ADR) was 34.9\u200a%, and the adenoma per colonoscopy rate (APCR) was 2.1. No significant differences were noted between the three endoscopy systems. Moreover, no differences in ADR or APCR were observed between the four imaging modalities. High definition white-light colonoscopy resulted in a significantly higher detection of sessile serrated adenomas (8.2\u200a% vs. 3.8\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.01) and adenocarcinomas (2.6\u200a% vs. 0.5\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.05) compared with the conventional procedure. Conclusions\u2002No significant differences in ADR or APCR between different endoscopy systems, high definition, and/or virtual chromoendoscopy could be observed in routine colonoscopies in the general population. High definition endoscopy was associated with a significantly higher detection rate of serrated adenomas and adenocarcinomas.",
