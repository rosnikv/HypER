            "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (HF) with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction is common and remains an extremely serious disorder with a high mortality and morbidity. Many complications related to HF can be related to thrombosis. Epidemiological and pathophysiological data also link HF to an increased risk of thrombosis, leading to the clinical consequences of sudden death, stroke, systemic thrombo\u2010embolism, and/or venous thrombo\u2010embolism. This consensus document of the Heart Failure Association (EHFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis reviews the published evidence and summarizes \u2018best practice\u2019, and puts forward consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and assist management decisions in everyday clinical practice. In HF patients with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation is recommended, and the CHA2DS2\u2010VASc and HAS\u2010BLED scores should be used to determine the likely risk\u2013benefit ratio (thrombo\u2010embolism prevention vs. risk of bleeding) of oral anticoagulation. In HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who are in sinus rhythm there is no evidence of an overall benefit of vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) on mortality, with risk of major bleeding. Despite the potential for a reduction in ischaemic stroke, there is currently no compelling reason to use warfarin routinely for these patients. Risk factors associated with increased risk of thrombo\u2010embolic events should be identified and decisions regarding use of anticoagulation individualized. Patient values and preferences are important determinants when balancing the risk of thrombo\u2010embolism against bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulants that offer a different risk\u2013benefit profile compared with warfarin may appear as an attractive therapeutic option, but this would need to be confirmed in clinical trials.",

            "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (HF) with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction is common and remains an extremely serious disorder with a high mortality and morbidity. Many complications related to HF can be related to thrombosis. Epidemiological and pathophysiological data also link HF to an increased risk of thrombosis, leading to the clinical consequences of sudden death, stroke, systemic thrombo\u2010embolism, and/or venous thrombo\u2010embolism. This consensus document of the Heart Failure Association (EHFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis reviews the published evidence and summarizes \u2018best practice\u2019, and puts forward consensus statements that may help to define evidence gaps and assist management decisions in everyday clinical practice. In HF patients with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation is recommended, and the CHA2DS2\u2010VASc and HAS\u2010BLED scores should be used to determine the likely risk\u2013benefit ratio (thrombo\u2010embolism prevention vs. risk of bleeding) of oral anticoagulation. In HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who are in sinus rhythm there is no evidence of an overall benefit of vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) on mortality, with risk of major bleeding. Despite the potential for a reduction in ischaemic stroke, there is currently no compelling reason to use warfarin routinely for these patients. Risk factors associated with increased risk of thrombo\u2010embolic events should be identified and decisions regarding use of anticoagulation individualized. Patient values and preferences are important determinants when balancing the risk of thrombo\u2010embolism against bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulants that offer a different risk\u2013benefit profile compared with warfarin may appear as an attractive therapeutic option, but this would need to be confirmed in clinical trials.",

The main objective of this study was to determine LXA4 plasma levels in PE women. The correlations among LXA4 levels, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP) levels, and clinical/laboratory parameters of the studied participants were also investigated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLXA4 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 23 nonpregnant, 26 normotensive pregnant, and 27 PE women (early PE (N = 10) and late PE (N = 17)), according to gestational age (GA) at clinical symptoms onset). The clinical/laboratory parameters included in Spearman's correlation analysis were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, platelet count, proteinuria, and white blood cell count (WBC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nLXA4 levels were higher in PE women than in nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women, and similar between nonpregnant and normotensive pregnant women. LXA4 plasma levels were higher in early PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA < 34 weeks) and in late PE vs. normotensive pregnancy (GA \u2265 34 weeks). No significant differences were detected between early and late PE. LXA4 levels were positively correlated with us-CRP levels, SBP, DBP, and WBC. No significant correlation was detected between LXA4 levels and the other laboratory parameters.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChronic inflammation in PE, in spite of increased levels of LXA4, points to a possible failure in this regulatory pathway. Further studies are necessary to clarify this issue and to evaluate the role of LXA4 and other proresolving mediators of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PE.",

            "abstract": "Background/Aims: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint degenerative biomechanical disorder involving immunity, metabolic alterations, inflammation, and cartilage degradation, where chondrocytes play a pivotal role. OA has not effective pharmacological treatments and new therapeutic targets are needed. Adipokines contribute to the low-grade systemic inflammation in OA. Here, we explored novel molecular mechanisms of sodium butyrate (BuNa) in modulating inflammation and chemotaxis in chondrocytes, demonstrating the direct involvement of its G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-43. Methods: ATDC5 murine chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, in the presence or not of BuNa, for 24 h. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory mediators and structural proteins. Results: Butyrate reduced the expression of canonic pro-inflammatory mediators (Nos2, COX-2, IL-6), pro-inflammatory adipokines (lipocalin-2 and nesfatin-1) and adhesion molecule (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes, inhibiting several inflammatory signalling pathways (NF\u03baB, MAPKinase, AMPK-\u03b1, PI3K/Akt). Butyrate also reduced metalloproteinase production and limited the loss of type II collagen in IL-1\u03b2-inflamed chondrocytes. The chemoattractant effect of butyrate, after different inflammatory challenges, was revealed by increased annexin (AnxA)1 levels and chemokines expression. The chemoattractant and anti-inflammatory activities of butyrate were completely blunted by GPR43 silencing using RNA interference. Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest the potential application of sodium butyrate as a novel candidate in a multi-target approach for the treatment of chondrocyte inflammation and cartilage degenerative process.",

            "abstract": "Gut microbes influence tumor development and progression in the intestines and may provide a novel paradigm for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut dysbiosis may be associated with the development and progression of CRC. Identifying the interactions between the colonic tract and gut microbiota may provide novel information relevant to CRC prevention. The present study examined the effects of butyrate-producing Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (B. pullicaecorum) on mice with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced CRC and the microbial metabolite of B. pullicaecorum on CRC cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the mouse colon tissues and reverse transcription PCR of CRC cells were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) transporter solute carrier family 5 member 8 (SLC5A8) and G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43). In CRC-bearing mice fed B. pullicaecorum, DMH-induced CRC regressed, body weight increased and serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels decreased. Notably, SLC5A8 and GPR43 were diffusely and moderately to strongly expressed in the neoplastic epithelial cells and underlying muscularis propria in the colons of the mice. In conclusion, administration of B. pullicaecorum or its metabolites improved the clinical outcome of CRC by activating the SCFA transporter and/or receptor. These results indicated that B. pullicaecorum was a probiotic with anti-CRC potential.",

            "abstract": "This review describes current evidence supporting butyrate impact in the homeostatic regulation of the digestive ecosystem in health and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Butyrate is mainly produced by bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum. It stimulates mature colonocytes and inhibits undifferentiated malignant and stem cells. Butyrate oxidation in mature colonocytes (1) produces 70\u201380% of their energetic requirements, (2) prevents stem cell inhibition by limiting butyrate access to crypts, and (3) consumes oxygen, generating hypoxia and maintaining luminal anaerobiosis favorable to the microbiota. Butyrate stimulates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the GPR41 and GPR109A receptors, and inhibits HDAC in different cell types, thus stabilizing the gut barrier function and decreasing inflammatory processes. However, some studies indicate contrary effects according to butyrate concentrations. IBD patients exhibit a lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and butyrate content. Additionally, colonocyte butyrate oxidation is depressed in these subjects, lowering luminal anaerobiosis and facilitating the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae that contribute to inflammation. Accordingly, gut dysbiosis and decreased barrier function in IBD seems to be secondary to the impaired mitochondrial disturbance in colonic epithelial cells.",

            "abstract": "This review describes current evidence supporting butyrate impact in the homeostatic regulation of the digestive ecosystem in health and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Butyrate is mainly produced by bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum. It stimulates mature colonocytes and inhibits undifferentiated malignant and stem cells. Butyrate oxidation in mature colonocytes (1) produces 70\u201380% of their energetic requirements, (2) prevents stem cell inhibition by limiting butyrate access to crypts, and (3) consumes oxygen, generating hypoxia and maintaining luminal anaerobiosis favorable to the microbiota. Butyrate stimulates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the GPR41 and GPR109A receptors, and inhibits HDAC in different cell types, thus stabilizing the gut barrier function and decreasing inflammatory processes. However, some studies indicate contrary effects according to butyrate concentrations. IBD patients exhibit a lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and butyrate content. Additionally, colonocyte butyrate oxidation is depressed in these subjects, lowering luminal anaerobiosis and facilitating the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae that contribute to inflammation. Accordingly, gut dysbiosis and decreased barrier function in IBD seems to be secondary to the impaired mitochondrial disturbance in colonic epithelial cells.",
