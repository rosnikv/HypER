            "abstract": "Propylthiouracil has been shown experimentally to protect against alcohol-induced hepatocellular necrosis in hypoxic conditions. An earlier, short-term study of patients with alcoholism and liver disease indicated clinical improvement with propylthiouracil, but the effect on mortality could not be assessed. In the present study, we investigated the effect of propylthiouracil on mortality in patients with alcoholic liver disease in a long-term, double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 310 compliant patients who received propylthiouracil (n = 157) or placebo (n = 153) for a maximum of two years. There were no differences between the two groups in demographic and clinical characteristics and biopsy-confirmed diagnoses at randomization, or in daily urinary alcohol levels during the study. The cumulative dropout rate over two years was not significantly different (propylthiouracil group, 0.68; placebo group, 0.60). The group receiving propylthiouracil (300 mg per day) had a cumulative mortality rate half that in the group receiving placebo (0.13 vs. 0.25 [P less than 0.05] in the total sample, and 0.25 vs. 0.55 [P less than 0.03] in a subgroup of severely ill patients [propylthiouracil group, n = 56; placebo group, n = 41]). Proportional-hazards stepwise regression analyses indicated that only propylthiouracil treatment, prothrombin time, hemoglobin levels, and mean daily urinary alcohol levels significantly affected mortality. The hazards ratio for the complete group indicated that mortality in the propylthiouracil group was 0.38 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.83) that of the placebo group. Protection by propylthiouracil was not observed in patients with high morning urinary alcohol levels. No clinically important side effects of propylthiouracil were observed at the dose used. We conclude that the administration of propylthiouracil can reduce mortality due to alcoholic liver disease.",

            "abstract": "The basal energy production rate was measured using indirect calorimetry in 25 stable cirrhotic patients and 10 controls of comparable age. The endogenous substrate oxidation was also calculated by measuring urinary nitrogen excretion. The energy production rate was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls. The origins of liver disease and the degree of liver damage did not seem to influence the energy production rate. On the other hand, in cirrhotic patients, as in controls, a significant correlation was present between the energy production rate and parameters of body size, such as body weight and fat\u2010free mass. As a consequence, cirrhotic patients with poor nutritional status, with a reduced fat\u2010free mass, showed a lower energy production rate. The measured energy production rate was compared with the resting energy expenditure estimated by formulas commonly used in healthy individuals. The good agreement found between the measured energy production rate and calculated energy expenditure suggests that these formulas may be applied to stable cirrhotic patients in clinical practice. In cirrhotic patients, the oxidation of endogenous fat is the main contributor to basal energy production rate. The fat oxidation rate does not appear to be influenced by the hormonal pattern found in the cirrhotic patients. However, a significant correlation was present between fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid levels. This confirms that the prevalent fat use in cirrhotic patients is supported by the greater availability of fat\u2010derived substrates. (HEPATOLOGY 1990;12:106\u2013112).",

            "abstract": "Oral glucose tolerance was tested in a heterogeneous group of 108 patients with liver cirrhosis. Data were compared with those from 181 subjects without liver disease (44% normal, 35% impaired glucose tolerance and 21% type 2 diabetes mellitus). In cirrhosis, 27% of the patients had normal, 36% had impaired glucose tolerance, and 37% were diabetic. There was no association between glucose intolerance or diabetes and the aetiology of cirrhosis, the duration of the disease, the biochemical indicators of hepatocyte damage, cholestasis and/or liver function. Only weak associations were found between the results of quantitative liver functions tests (caffeine, xylocaine, indocyanine green) and basal and post load glucose and insulin concentrations. Cirrhotics with 1st degree relatives with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 16) did not show an increased prevalence of diabetes. Older and/or malnourished patients were more frequently glucose intolerant. Using the plasma glucose concentration 120 minutes after glucose load as the dependent variable, multivariate regression analysis showed that 54% of its variance is associated with the following variables: basal plasma glucose (36%) and free fatty acid concentration (5%), age (3%), basal glucose oxidation rate (3%), muscle mass (3%) and plasma free glycerol at 120 minutes after glucose load (3%). By contrast, the clinical state of the patients (i.e. the CHILD-Pugh score) accounted for only 2% of the variance. We conclude that glucose tolerance is variable in cirrhosis. After manifestation of liver disease, glucose intolerance or diabetes cannot be explained by the clinical, histological or biochemical signs of liver disease.",

Localization and absolute quantification should help to trace regional hepatic metabolism. An improved protocol for the absolute quantification of 31P metabolites in vivo in human liver was developed by employing three\u2010dimensional (3D) k\u2010space weighted spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) with B1\u2010insensitive adiabatic excitation. The protocol allowed for high spatial resolution of 17.8 \u00b1 0.22 cm3 in 34 min at 3 T. No pulse adjustment prior to MRSI measurement was necessary due to adiabatic excitation. The protocol geometry was identical for all measurements so that one calibration data set, acquired from phantom replacement measurement, was applied for all quantifications. The protocol was tested in 10 young, healthy volunteers, for whom 57 \u00b1 7 spectra were quantified.

Steatosis and T2DM have been further associated with impaired muscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover indicating reduced mitochondrial fitness. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that hepatic energy metabolism could be impaired even in metabolically well\u2010controlled T2DM. We measured hepatic lipid volume fraction (HLVF) and absolute concentrations of \u03b3ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters using noninvasive 1H/ 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in individuals with T2DM (58 \u00b1 6 years, 27 \u00b1 3 kg/m 2), and age\u2010matched and body mass index\u2013matched (mCON; 61 \u00b1 4 years, 26 \u00b1 4 kg/m 2) and young lean humans (yCON; 25 \u00b1 3 years, 22 \u00b1 2 kg/m 2, P < 0.005, P < 0.05 versus T2DM and mCON). Insulin\u2010mediated whole\u2010body glucose disposal (M) and endogenous glucose production (iEGP) were assessed during euglycemic\u2010hyperinsulinemic clamps. Individuals with T2DM had 26% and 23% lower \u03b3ATP (1.68 \u00b1 0.11; 2.26 \u00b1 0.20; 2.20 \u00b1 0.09 mmol/L; P < 0.05) than mCON and yCON individuals, respectively. Further, they had 28% and 31% lower Pi than did individuals from the mCON and yCON groups (0.96 \u00b1 0.06; 1.33 \u00b1 0.13; 1.41 \u00b1 0.07 mmol/L; P < 0.05). Phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and liver aminotransferases did not differ between groups. HLVF was not different between those from the T2DM and mCON groups, but higher (P = 0.002) than in those from the yCON group. T2DM had 13\u2010fold higher iEGP than mCON (P < 0.05). Even after adjustment for HLVF, hepatic ATP and Pi related negatively to hepatic insulin sensitivity (iEGP) (r =\u20100.665, P = 0.010, r =\u20100.680, P = 0.007) but not to whole\u2010body insulin sensitivity.

We measured hepatic lipid volume fraction (HLVF) and absolute concentrations of \u03b3ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters using noninvasive 1H/ 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in individuals with T2DM (58 \u00b1 6 years, 27 \u00b1 3 kg/m 2), and age\u2010matched and body mass index\u2013matched (mCON; 61 \u00b1 4 years, 26 \u00b1 4 kg/m 2) and young lean humans (yCON; 25 \u00b1 3 years, 22 \u00b1 2 kg/m 2, P < 0.005, P < 0.05 versus T2DM and mCON). Insulin\u2010mediated whole\u2010body glucose disposal (M) and endogenous glucose production (iEGP) were assessed during euglycemic\u2010hyperinsulinemic clamps. Individuals with T2DM had 26% and 23% lower \u03b3ATP (1.68 \u00b1 0.11; 2.26 \u00b1 0.20; 2.20 \u00b1 0.09 mmol/L; P < 0.05) than mCON and yCON individuals, respectively. Further, they had 28% and 31% lower Pi than did individuals from the mCON and yCON groups (0.96 \u00b1 0.06; 1.33 \u00b1 0.13; 1.41 \u00b1 0.07 mmol/L; P < 0.05). Phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and liver aminotransferases did not differ between groups. HLVF was not different between those from the T2DM and mCON groups, but higher (P = 0.002) than in those from the yCON group. T2DM had 13\u2010fold higher iEGP than mCON (P < 0.05). Even after adjustment for HLVF, hepatic ATP and Pi related negatively to hepatic insulin sensitivity (iEGP) (r =\u20100.665, P = 0.010, r =\u20100.680, P = 0.007) but not to whole\u2010body insulin sensitivity. Conclusion: These data suggest that impaired hepatic energy metabolism and insulin resistance could precede the development of steatosis in individuals with T2DM. (HEPATOLOGY 2009.)",

            "abstract": "The high mortality associated with pancytopenia and multi-organ failure resulting from hematopoietic disorders of acute radiation syndrome (h-ARS) creates an urgent need for developing more effective treatment strategies. Here, we showed that bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) effectively regulate oxidative stress following radiative injury, which might be on account of irradiation-induced elevation of protein levels of CR6-interacting factor 1(CRIF1) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2(NRF2). Crif1-knockdown BMMSCs presented increased oxidative stress and apoptosis after irradiation, which were partially due to a suppressed antioxidant response mediated by decreased NRF2 nuclear translocation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments indicated that CRIF1 interacted with protein kinase C-\u03b4 (PKC-\u03b4). NRF2 Ser40 phosphorylation was inhibited in Crif1-deficient BMMSCs even in the presence of three kinds of PKC agonists, suggesting that CRIF1 might co-activate PKC-\u03b4 to phosphorylate NRF2 Ser40. After radiative injury, the supporting effect of BMMSCs for the colony forming ability of HSCs in vitro was reduced, and the deficiency of CRIF1 aggravated such damage. Thus, CRIF1 plays an essential role in PKC-\u03b4/NRF2 pathway modulation to alleviate oxidative stress in BMMSCs after irradiative injury, and at some level it may maintain the HSCs-supporting effect of BMMSCs after radiative injuries.",

            "abstract": "Significance The mechanism of radioresistance in osteosarcoma is unknown. We analyze osteosarcoma patient tissues, combine in vitro and in vivo mouse osteosarcoma models, and determine that CR6-interacting factor-1 (CRIF1) drives radioresistance by regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). After ionizing radiation, CRIF1 promotes CDK2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation on T14/T160, facilitating G1/S checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair. CRIF1 knockdown enhances the radiosensitivity of osteosarcoma in both in vitro and xenograft models. Our study sheds light on the role of tumor-specific biomarkers in identifying a therapeutic window to overcome radioresistance of osteosarcoma, pointing out a way to precision medicine for a particular patient. Resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which is a conventional treatment for osteosarcoma that cannot be resected, undermines the efficacy of this therapy. However, the mechanism by which IR induces radioresistance in osteosarcoma is not defined. Here, we report that CR6-interacting factor-1 (CRIF1) is highly expressed in osteosarcoma and undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) after IR. Osteosarcoma cells lacking CRIF1 show increased sensitivity to IR, which is associated with delayed DNA damage repair, inactivated G1/S checkpoint, and mitochondrial dysfunction. CRIF1 interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint regulator CDK2, and CRIF1 and CDK2 colocalize in the nucleus after IR. Nuclear localization of CDK2 is associated with phosphorylation changes that promote DNA repair and activation of the G1/S checkpoint. CRIF1 knockdown synergized with IR in an in vivo osteosarcoma model, leading to tumor regression. Based on these findings, we identify CRIF1 as a potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma that can increase the efficacy of radiotherapy. More broadly, our findings may provide insights into the mechanism for other types of radioresistant cancers and be exploited for therapeutic ends.",

CRIF1 knockdown enhances the radiosensitivity of osteosarcoma in both in vitro and xenograft models. Our study sheds light on the role of tumor-specific biomarkers in identifying a therapeutic window to overcome radioresistance of osteosarcoma, pointing out a way to precision medicine for a particular patient. Resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which is a conventional treatment for osteosarcoma that cannot be resected, undermines the efficacy of this therapy. However, the mechanism by which IR induces radioresistance in osteosarcoma is not defined. Here, we report that CR6-interacting factor-1 (CRIF1) is highly expressed in osteosarcoma and undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) after IR. Osteosarcoma cells lacking CRIF1 show increased sensitivity to IR, which is associated with delayed DNA damage repair, inactivated G1/S checkpoint, and mitochondrial dysfunction. CRIF1 interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint regulator CDK2, and CRIF1 and CDK2 colocalize in the nucleus after IR. Nuclear localization of CDK2 is associated with phosphorylation changes that promote DNA repair and activation of the G1/S checkpoint. CRIF1 knockdown synergized with IR in an in vivo osteosarcoma model, leading to tumor regression. Based on these findings, we identify CRIF1 as a potential therapeutic target in osteosarcoma that can increase the efficacy of radiotherapy. More broadly, our findings may provide insights into the mechanism for other types of radioresistant cancers and be exploited for therapeutic ends.",

TP-3 is a murine IgG2b monoclonal antibody with high affinity for an epitope residing on the p80 osteosarcoma cell surface membrane antigen. The tumor-associated antigen p80 is overexpressed in osteosarcomas, and has very low normal tissue expression. We propose a novel dual alpha targeting solution containing two radionuclides from the same decay chain, including the bone-seeking 224Ra, and cancer cell-surface seeking 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for the treatment of osteoblastic bone cancers, circulating cancer cells and micrometastases. In this in vitro study, the cytotoxic effects of 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 (single alpha solution) and 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 (dual alpha solution) were investigated in a multicellular spheroid model mimicking micrometastatic disease in osteosarcoma. OHS spheroids with diameters of 253 \u00b1 98 \u03bcm treated with 4.5, 2.7, and 3.3 kBq/ml of 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for 1, 4, and 24 h, respectively, were disintegrated within 3 weeks. The 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 induced a 7-fold delay in spheroid doubling time compared to a 28-times higher dose with the non-specific 212Pb-TCMC-rituximab.

Treatment with 1 kBq/ml of 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for 24 h caused an 11.4-fold reduction in spheroid viability compared with unconjugated 224Ra/212Pb.
