Mobilizing hematopoietic progenitor cells is a promising intervention to this deadly disease. Aim. Evaluate granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) as therapeutic modality in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). Subjects and Methods. This case-control prospective study was conducted on 20 children with IDCM following up at Cardiology Clinic Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University (group 1) who were compared to another 10 age-, sex-, duration-of-illness-, and systolic-function-matched children with IDCM as control (group 2). They were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, echocardiography, and peripheral blood CD34+ cell assessment before and one week after GCSF intake for 5 consecutive days (by group 1 but not group 2). Results. A significant improvement in echocardiographic data and CD34+-T-cell increase was found in group 1 one week after GCSF intake and for the next 6 months CD34+ T cells percentage of change showed no significant correlation with the that of the left ventricular dimensions and systolic function. Conclusion. Administration of GCSF to children with IDCM resulted in clinical and echocardiographic improvement not correlated to mobilized CD34+ T cells, implying involvement of additional mechanisms over simple stem cell mobilization.",

So the aim of the work is to evaluate the efficacy of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a therapeutic modality in pediatric IDCM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized clinical trial was conducted on 40 pediatric patients with IDCM. They were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine phosphokinase isoenzyme B (CK-MB) isoenzyme, and peripheral blood CD34(+) cell assessment before and at day 7 after subcutaneous G-CSF injection for 5 consecutive days. Echocardiography was done before and 1, 3 and 6 months after therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical improvement in the form of regression of patients Modified Ross heart failure (MRHC) classification classes. Increased percentage of CD34(+) mobilized cells from the bone marrow, and significant increase in blood counts especially white blood cells 7 days after G-CSF injection. Significant improvement was found in echocardiographic data evaluating systolic function of the heart [Ejection fraction, Fractional shortening and systolic velocity at mitral annulus (Sm)].\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdministration of G-CSF may be beneficial in improving systolic functions of the heart in pediatric IDCM and more studies with a large number of patients are needed.",

            "abstract": "Cardiosphere-derived exosomes improve cardiac function in dilated cardiomyopathy and provide safety lead-in results for further clinical translation. Curbing cardiomyopathy Stem cells and exosomes have been investigated as potential treatments for cardiovascular applications with varying degrees of success. Here, Hirai et al. treated a porcine model of dilated cardiomyopathy with cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) or CDCs pretreated to prevent release of their exosomes. Cardiac repair was achieved with injection of CDCs, but blocking exosome release abrogated functional recovery\u2014even when exosomes were coinjected with cells. Moving into the clinic, they safely treated five pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with CDCs. Analysis of patients\u2019 CDC-derived exosomes implicated miR-146a-5p in inhibiting inflammatory cytokine expression. Results demonstrate the safety of CDC treatment and highlight a potential mechanism of therapeutic efficacy. Although cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) improve cardiac function and outcomes in patients with single ventricle physiology, little is known about their safety and therapeutic benefit in children with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of CDCs in a porcine model of DCM and translate the preclinical results into this patient population. A swine model of DCM using intracoronary injection of microspheres created cardiac dysfunction. Forty pigs were randomized as preclinical validation of the delivery method and CDC doses, and CDC-secreted exosome (CDCex)\u2013mediated cardiac repair was analyzed. A phase 1 safety cohort enrolled five pediatric patients with DCM and reduced ejection fraction to receive CDC infusion. The primary endpoint was to assess safety, and the secondary outcome measure was change in cardiac function. Improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial fibrosis were noted in animals treated with CDCs compared with placebo. These functional benefits were mediated via CDCex that were highly enriched with proangiogenic and cardioprotective microRNAs (miRNAs), whereas isolated CDCex did not recapitulate these reparative effects. One-year follow-up of safety lead-in stage was completed with favorable profile and preliminary efficacy outcomes. Increased CDCex-derived miR-146a-5p expression was associated with the reduction in myocardial fibrosis via suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and transcripts. Collectively, intracoronary CDC administration is safe and improves cardiac function through CDCex in a porcine model of DCM. The safety lead-in results in patients provide a translational framework for further studies of randomized trials and CDCex-derived miRNAs as potential paracrine mediators underlying this therapeutic strategy.",

            "abstract": "Myocardial infarction arises from an excessive or prolonged inflammatory response, leading to ventricular remodeling or impaired cardiac function. Macrophages exhibit different polarization types associated with inflammation both at steady state and after myocardial infarction. Exosomal miR-146a-5p has been identified as an important molecule in the cardiovascular field in recent years. However, the effect of cardiomyocyte-derived exosomal miR-146a-5p on macrophages has not yet been elucidated. Initially, we found that exosomes with low expression of miR-146a-5p derived from myocardial infarction tissues modulated macrophage polarization. To determine whether cardiomyocyte-derived exosomal miR-146a-5p mediated macrophage polarization, we treated macrophages with exosomes rich in miR-146a-5p collected from neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. The effects of exosomal miR-146a-5p on macrophage polarization were measured using RT-qPCR, transwell assays, and western blotting. The results showed that the increased expression of miR-146a-5p promoted M1 macrophage polarization, inhibited M2 macrophage polarization, and increased the expression of VEGFA. However, the decreased expression of exosomalmiR-146a-5p showed the opposite trends. Interestingly, in contrast to treatment with the solitary miR-146a-5p mimic, exosomal miR-146a-5p derived from neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes reduced TNF\u03b1 and iNOS expression. In addition, when macrophages were activated by the miR-146a-5p mimic or exosomal miR-146a-5p, the expression of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a target gene of miR-146a-5p, was reduced significantly. Taken together, these findings indicate that exosomal miR-146a-5p derived from cardiomyocytes could stimulate M1 macrophage polarization to induce an inflammatory reaction, while targeting TRAF6, exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. Exosomal miR-146a-5p plays important roles in macrophages, illuminating a novel potential therapeutic target in myocardial infarction.",

            "abstract": "Myocardial infarction arises from an excessive or prolonged inflammatory response, leading to ventricular remodeling or impaired cardiac function. Macrophages exhibit different polarization types associated with inflammation both at steady state and after myocardial infarction. Exosomal miR-146a-5p has been identified as an important molecule in the cardiovascular field in recent years. However, the effect of cardiomyocyte-derived exosomal miR-146a-5p on macrophages has not yet been elucidated. Initially, we found that exosomes with low expression of miR-146a-5p derived from myocardial infarction tissues modulated macrophage polarization. To determine whether cardiomyocyte-derived exosomal miR-146a-5p mediated macrophage polarization, we treated macrophages with exosomes rich in miR-146a-5p collected from neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. The effects of exosomal miR-146a-5p on macrophage polarization were measured using RT-qPCR, transwell assays, and western blotting.
