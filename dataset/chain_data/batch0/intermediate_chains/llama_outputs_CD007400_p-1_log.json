            "abstract": "In a randomized, double blind, multicentre study with 4 weeks follow-up of 290 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee joint, a topical NSAID (eltenac) was compared with oral diclofenac and placebo. The main outcome, Lequesne's Index and pain by VAS showed no statistically significant differences between neither of the active treatments and placebo for the total study population. However, in patients with more severe symptoms, both active groups showed statistically significant differences to placebo. No severe adverse drug reactions were seen but the number of GI reactions were three times higher in the diclofenac group compared to the topical treatment. Local skin reactions were twice as frequent in the eltenac than in the placebo group. Taking into account the nature of the treatment for a chronic disease like OA, our results indicate that eltenac gel could be a safe alternative to oral NSAIDs.",

            "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide and are responsible for approximately one-quarter of all adverse drug reaction reports. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for patients with rheumatic disease--a population at increased risk for serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Topical administration of NSAIDs offers the advantage of local, enhanced drug delivery to affected tissues with a reduced incidence of systemic adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease and GI haemorrhage. NSAIDs administered topically penetrate slowly and in small quantities into the systemic circulation; bioavailability and maximal plasma NSAID concentration after topical application are generally less than 5 and 15%, respectively, compared with equivalent oral administration. Product formulation may have a dramatic impact, not only on absorption rates but also on penetration depth. Compared with oral administration, topical application leads to relatively high NSAID concentrations in the dermis. Concentrations achieved in the muscle tissue below the site of application are variable, but are at least equivalent to that obtained with oral administration. NSAIDs applied topically do reach the synovial fluid, but the extent and mechanism (topical penetration versus distribution via the systemic circulation) remain to be determined. In addition, marked interindividual variability was noted in all studies; percutaneous absorption may be strongly influenced by individual skin properties. In general, interpretation of clinical studies measuring efficacy of topical NSAIDs in rheumatic disease states is difficult because of a remarkably high placebo response rate, use of rescue paracetamol (acetaminophen), and significant variability in percutaneous absorption and response rates between patients. Overall efficacy rates attributable to topical NSAIDs in patients with rheumatic disorders ranged from 18 to 92% of treated patients. Topically applied NSAIDs have a superior safety profile to oral formulations. Adverse effects secondary to topical NSAID application occur in approximately 10 to 15% of patients and are primarily cutaneous in nature (rash and pruritus at site of application). GI adverse drug reactions are rare with topically applied NSAIDs, compared with a 15% incidence reported for oral NSAIDs. Available clinical studies suggest, but do not document, equivalent efficacy of topical over oral NSAIDs in rheumatic diseases.",

            "abstract": "The pentaethyl ester prodrug of the chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) referred to as C2E5 is being developed as an orally bioavailable radionuclide decorporation agent. The predicted human efficacy obtained in these experimental animals is confounded by interspecies variations of metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, carboxylesterase-mediated metabolism of [(14)C]-C2E5 was compared in the S9 intestinal and hepatic fractions of human, dog, and rat and their respective plasma. Intestinal hydrolysis of C2E5, resulting in the formation of the tetraethyl ester of DTPA (C2E4), was only detected in human and rat. The primary metabolite in human and dog hepatic fractions was C2E4, whereas the predominant species identified in rat hepatic fractions was the triethyl ester (C2E3). Hepatic hydrolysis of C2E5 causes the formation of C2E4 in human, dog, and rat and C2E3 in rat only. Minimal C2E5 hydrolysis was observed in human and dog plasma, whereas in rat plasma C2E5 converted to C2E3 rapidly, followed by slower further metabolism. Both recombinant CES1 and CES2 play roles in C2E5 metabolism. Together, these data suggest that dogs may be the most appropriate species for predicting human C2E5 metabolism, whereas rats might be useful for clarifying the potential toxicity of C2E5 metabolites.",

            "abstract": "The pentaethyl ester prodrug of the chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) referred to as C2E5 is being developed as an orally bioavailable radionuclide decorporation agent. The predicted human efficacy obtained in these experimental animals is confounded by interspecies variations of metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, carboxylesterase-mediated metabolism of [(14)C]-C2E5 was compared in the S9 intestinal and hepatic fractions of human, dog, and rat and their respective plasma. Intestinal hydrolysis of C2E5, resulting in the formation of the tetraethyl ester of DTPA (C2E4), was only detected in human and rat. The primary metabolite in human and dog hepatic fractions was C2E4, whereas the predominant species identified in rat hepatic fractions was the triethyl ester (C2E3). Hepatic hydrolysis of C2E5 causes the formation of C2E4 in human, dog, and rat and C2E3 in rat only. Minimal C2E5 hydrolysis was observed in human and dog plasma, whereas in rat plasma C2E5 converted to C2E3 rapidly, followed by slower further metabolism. Both recombinant CES1 and CES2 play roles in C2E5 metabolism. Together, these data suggest that dogs may be the most appropriate species for predicting human C2E5 metabolism, whereas rats might be useful for clarifying the potential toxicity of C2E5 metabolites.",

            "abstract": "In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), glutamine is a critical nutrient that drives a wide array of metabolic and biosynthetic processes that support tumor growth. Despite this established dependency, the targeting of specific enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism is yet to yield any clinical benefit. Here, we have examined the therapeutic potential of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine antagonist that broadly inhibits glutamine metabolism. We found that DON treatment significantly blocks PDAC tumor growth and attenuates metastasis. Interestingly, we link the effectiveness of DON in PDAC to asparagine (Asn) metabolism. By inhibiting asparagine synthetase (ASNS), DON significantly reduces intracellular Asn production and Asn supplementation rescues the anti-proliferative effects of DON. We discern that PDAC cells upregulate expression of ASNS as a metabolic adaptation and that modulating ASNS levels can impact DON efficacy. Strikingly, in patient-derived organoids, DON responsiveness is inversely correlated with ASNS expression, a feature that is not observed for other metabolic enzymes targeted by DON. We find that treatment with L-asparaginase (ASNase), an enzyme that catabolizes free Asn, synergizes with DON to impact the viability of PDAC cells. Finally, we identify that a combination therapy of DON and ASNase has a significant impact on metastasis. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive the effects of glutamine mimicry and point to the utility of co-targeting adaptive responses to control PDAC progression.",

            "explanation": "This paper investigates the therapeutic potential of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine antagonist, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which is related to the source paper's use of a glutamine antagonist, JHU395, in medulloblastoma. The paper's findings on DON's mechanism of action could be relevant to understanding JHU395's effects in medulloblastoma."

                    "explanation": "This paper is partially dependent on the source paper as it also explores the role of glutamine metabolism in cancer. The source paper found that DON, a glutamine antagonist, blocks PDAC tumor growth and attenuates metastasis. This paper builds upon this finding by exploring the use of a broad-spectrum glutamine metabolism antagonist, DON, in treating Osimertinib-resistant lung cancer.",

The source paper found that ASNS is upregulated in PDAC cells and that modulating ASNS levels can impact DON efficacy. This paper builds upon this finding by exploring the role of ASNS in colorectal cancer and finding that METTL3 inhibition suppresses cell growth and survival via ASNS downregulation.",
