Subjects: Forty patients with lateral epicondylitis were randomized into two groups of 20 patients who were matched for age and sex. Interventions: The patients in one group were treated by iontophoresis of sodium diclofenac and the other group were treated by iontophoresis of sodium salicylate. Then infrared treatment was applied to patients in both groups. Main outcome measures: Pain scores obtained before and after treatment were compared. Results: Pain produced by pressure on the lateral epicondyle, on resisting wrist extension, during function and spontaneous pain at rest significantly decreased in both groups after treatment (p <0.001). When pain scores obtained after treatment were compared, greater decrease was observed in the pain produced on resisting wrist extension (p <0.01) and by pressure on the lateral epicondyle (p <0.05) in the group treated with sodium diclofenac than in the group treated with sodium salicylate. Conclusions: The results suggest some benefits from the process of iontophoresis and the use of infrared in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis and indicate that iontophoresis of sodium diclofenac is more effective than that of sodium salicylate.",

Because there is no agreement concerning the pathophysiology, several modes of treatments have been tried and one of the most common is local steroid injection. Iontophoresis using corticosteroids is a fairly new method recommended in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia and has become popular owing to impression of superiority compared to local injections\u2014noninvasive, painless and nontraumatic. The aim of this double\u2010blind prospective, randomized study was to evaluate the short\u2010 and the long\u2010term pain\u2010relieving effect of corticosteroid iontophoresis in lateral epicondylalgia. Sixty\u2010four patients suffering from lateral epicondylalgia were consecutively randomized into two groups for corticosteroid or placebo iontophoresis. The patients were treated four times during 2\u2003weeks. Follow\u2010ups were done the day after the final treatment and after 3 and 6\u2003months. Twenty\u2010three patients dropped out before the 3\u2010month follow\u2010up because they wanted to complement the treatment or replace it with other treatments. No significant difference between the corticosteroid group and the placebo group in relation to subjective and objective outcome could be observed after the treatment period or at the follow\u2010ups. In fact, both groups improved throughout the study. The results of the present study do not support the use of corticosteroid iontophoresis in lateral epicondylalgia.",

            "abstract": "The condition first known as \u201ctennis elbow\u201d has been recognized for over a century. Typical signs and symptoms include pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, exacerbated by resisted wrist extension and passive wrist flexion, and impaired grip strength. Although many tennis players may experience this condition, most cases are associated with work-related activities or have no obvious precipitating event. As a result, the term now most widely used is lateral epicondylitis. Yet, this name implies a pathological basis that is contrary to longstanding, albeit evolving, evidence that it is not an inflammatory condition. It is therefore recommended that it is time to adopt a new and more appropriate term, such as epicondylalgia (suffix algia means pain), that does not reflect such underlying pathology. This Journal has recently embraced this terminology. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2005; 35(4):200\u2013202. doi:10.2519/jospt.2005.0104",

            "title": "Lateral epicondylalgia or epicondylitis: what's in a name?",
            "abstract": "The condition first known as \u201ctennis elbow\u201d has been recognized for over a century. Typical signs and symptoms include pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, exacerbated by resisted wrist extension and passive wrist flexion, and impaired grip strength. Although many tennis players may experience this condition, most cases are associated with work-related activities or have no obvious precipitating event. As a result, the term now most widely used is lateral epicondylitis. Yet, this name implies a pathological basis that is contrary to longstanding, albeit evolving, evidence that it is not an inflammatory condition. It is therefore recommended that it is time to adopt a new and more appropriate term, such as epicondylalgia (suffix algia means pain), that does not reflect such underlying pathology. This Journal has recently embraced this terminology. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2005; 35(4):200\u2013202. doi:10.2519/jospt.2005.0104",

            "explanation": "The hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it challenges the traditional terminology of 'lateral epicondylitis' and instead proposes 'epicondylalgia', which aligns with the source paper's discussion of tendinosis as a degenerative condition rather than an inflammatory one."

            "abstract": "Abstract Lateral epicondylalgia or tennis elbow is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that is characterized by lateral elbow pain often associated with gripping tasks. The underlying pathology remains to be fully elucidated; however, evidence indicates that the disorder does not involve an inflammatory process but rather impairments of the pain and motor systems as well as morphological changes in the structure of both the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle and tendon. Although the most efficient management approach remains controversial, there is a growing body of literature reporting the effects and underlying mechanisms of joint manipulation in the management of lateral epicondylalgia. Evidence exists demonstrating that joint manipulation directed at the elbow and wrist as well as at the cervical and thoracic spinal regions results in clinical alterations in pain and the motor system. In addition to presenting this evidence, this paper describes proposed underlying physiological mechanisms of joint manipulation associated with the observed clinical effects. We propose that this information will be useful for the physical therapist in making clinical decisions regarding the selection of treatment technique for the management of patients with lateral epicondylalgia.",
