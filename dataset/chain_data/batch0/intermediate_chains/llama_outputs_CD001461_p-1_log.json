Disease suppression began in 14 patients within three to 16 months (mean, seven months). Five patients achieved complete remission, two had activity in a single joint only, seven had partial disease suppression, and three showed no response. Prednisone dosage was decreased or administration discontinued in nine of ten patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.7 +/- 3 mg/day). Serial hand roentgenograms showed recortication of erosions in nine patients, with \"filling in\" of some erosions in three of these. No change was seen in the roentgenograms of five patients, while progressive disease occurred in three instances. Combined therapy with small doses of three drugs, each with proved antirheumatic activity when used separately in larger doses, may provide satisfactory long-term disease control in patients with intractable RA. This regimen is experimental. Proof of efficacy requires a controlled study. Until such data are obtained, this drug combination is not recommended for general use.",

Maintenance drug dosages (mean +/- SD) were as follows: cyclophosphamide, 30 +/- 24 mg/day; azathioprine, 74 +/- 44 mg/day; and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 210 +/- 92 mg/day. Disease suppression began in 30 patients within three to 24 months (mean, nine months). Results after 43 months (range, 12 to 102 months) were as follows: 16, complete remission; seven, near remission; seven, partial disease suppression; one, no response. None remained in prolonged remission without some form of therapy. Treatment was discontinued in three patients because of pulmonary infection (two) or thrombocytopenia (one). Four patients had five malignant neoplasms (surgical cures) before therapy (two breast, one colon, one melanoma, one endometrial); four patients developed a malignant neoplasm during combined drug therapy (one colon, one endometrial, one lung, one erythroleukemia); and three died. The absolute risk of malignancy from combined drug therapy is still unclear. We concluded that combined use of remittive agents may have promise in treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis; cyclophosphamide should be replaced with a nonalkylating agent; and the place of combined drug therapy remains uncertain in the absence of controlled trials.",

Synovial hyperplasia was compared in SEB-injected V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA), anti-V beta 8 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, and in V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice after injection of a non-V beta 8-reactive superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt day 30, increased synovial cells were observed in all SEB-treated mice, but the increase was greatest in the V beta 8 transgenic MRL-lpr/lpr mice. T cell involvement was indicated by the inability of either heat-denatured SEB or SEA to induce severe arthritis, the reduction in the severity of the arthritis on systemic treatment with CSA or anti-V beta 8, and the correlation of synovial hyperplasia with in vitro SEB reactivity of T cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese observations suggest that superantigens can induce chronic arthritis and that the induction and progression of the arthritis requires an underlying T cell defect in anergy induction in addition to exposure to the superantigen.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether cell lines derived from RA type B synoviocytes could also serve as accessory cells for T lymphocyte activation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCells from RA synoviocyte lines, with or without preculture in interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), were cultured with purified peripheral blood T cells, in the presence or absence of superantigens or other accessory cell-dependent T cell mitogens. T cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation, and synoviocyte surface markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA type B synoviocyte lines were potent accessory cells for T cell responses to bacterial superantigens or lectins, and direct cell-cell contact was required. Preculture in IFN gamma augmented synoviocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and of ligands for some T cell costimulatory receptors, but synoviocyte accessory cell function was evident even in the absence of IFN gamma. Blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies supported the notion of a role CD2, CD11a/CD18 and MHC class II molecules in synoviocyte-dependent T cell activation.

Aberrant HLA class II expression on synovial lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis synovial membrane has been described, and the extent and intensity of class II expression on the cells was claimed to be linked with the severity of the disease. In this study, the effects of TGF-beta1 on HLA class II antigen expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFC) from rheumatoid synovectomy tissues were determined by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that pre-incubation of cells with TGF-beta1 was able to down-regulate IFN-gamma-induced DR protein expression in SFC. TGF-beta1, additionally, down-regulated IFN-gamma-stimulated class II transactivator (CIITA) and DRB mRNA expression. The constitutive expression of CIITA mRNA was completely abolished and the constitutive expression of DRB mRNA was decreased after treatment of SFC with TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Addition of the TGF-beta inhibitor decorin to SFC for 24 h before TGF-beta1/IFN-gamma treatment was able to reduce the down-regulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on DR antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma. Using competitive RT-PCR, we found that SFC constitutively expressed decorin mRNA and that treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 for 24 h reduced the constitutive expression of decorin mRNA by 65%. Our results show that TGF-beta1 is able to reduce the expression of HLA class II mRNA and protein, and suggest a tight regulation between TGF-beta1 and decorin in SFC of the rheumatoid synovium.",

The transcriptional coactivator class II transactivator (CIITA) controls MHCII expression. The CIITA gene is regulated by three independent promoters (pI, pIII, pIV). We have generated pIV knockout mice. These mice exhibit selective abrogation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3\u2013induced MHCII expression on a wide variety of non-bone marrow\u2013derived cells, including endothelia, epithelia, astrocytes, and fibroblasts. Constitutive MHCII expression on cortical thymic epithelial cells, and thus positive selection of CD4+ T cells, is also abolished. In contrast, constitutive and inducible MHCII expression is unaffected on professional antigen-presenting cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, and IFN-\u03b3\u2013activated cells of the macrophage lineage. pIV\u2212/\u2212 mice have thus allowed precise definition of CIITA pIV usage in vivo. Moreover, they represent a unique animal model for studying the significance and contribution of MHCII-mediated antigen presentation by nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells in health and disease.",

The transcriptional coactivator class II transactivator (CIITA) controls MHCII expression. The CIITA gene is regulated by three independent promoters (pI, pIII, pIV). We have generated pIV knockout mice. These mice exhibit selective abrogation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3\u2013induced MHCII expression on a wide variety of non-bone marrow\u2013derived cells, including endothelia, epithelia, astrocytes, and fibroblasts. Constitutive MHCII expression on cortical thymic epithelial cells, and thus positive selection of CD4+ T cells, is also abolished. In contrast, constitutive and inducible MHCII expression is unaffected on professional antigen-presenting cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, and IFN-\u03b3\u2013activated cells of the macrophage lineage. pIV\u2212/\u2212 mice have thus allowed precise definition of CIITA pIV usage in vivo. Moreover, they represent a unique animal model for studying the significance and contribution of MHCII-mediated antigen presentation by nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells in health and disease.",

            "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) persists inside macrophages despite vigorous immune responses. MTB and MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibit class II MHC (MHC-II) expression and Ag processing by a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent mechanism that is shown in this study to involve a defect in IFN-\u03b3 induction of class II transactivator (CIITA). Exposure of macrophages to MTB or MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced MHC-II expression, but not IL-4-induced MHC-II expression, by preventing induction of mRNA for CIITA (total, type I, and type IV), IFN regulatory factor-1, and MHC-II. MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein induced mRNA for suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 but did not inhibit IFN-\u03b3-induced Stat1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the lipoprotein inhibited MHC-II Ag processing in SOCS1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit translocation of phosphorylated Stat1 to the nucleus or Stat1 binding to and transactivation of IFN-\u03b3-sensitive promoter constructs. Thus, MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibited IFN-\u03b3 signaling independent of SOCS1 and without interfering with the activation of Stat1. Inhibition of IFN-\u03b3-induced CIITA by MTB 19-kDa lipoprotein may allow MTB to evade detection by CD4+ T cells.",

            "abstract": "During infection of macrophages, prolonged signaling by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or its 19-kDa lipoprotein (LpqH; Rv3763) inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of several immune function genes, including class II transactivator (CIITA), which regulates class II MHC. Mtb does not inhibit early IFN-\u03b3 signaling events, e.g., Stat1\u03b1 activation. This study analyzed downstream mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MHC2TA, the gene encoding CIITA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that IFN-\u03b3 induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the CIITA promoter IV (pIV). In contrast, IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation at CIITA pIV was inhibited by Mtb or 19-kDa lipoprotein. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein also inhibited IFN-\u03b3-dependent recruitment of Brahma-related gene 1, a chromatin remodeling protein, to CIITA pIV. Mtb 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit histone acetylation in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Furthermore, 19-kDa lipoprotein did not inhibit CIITA expression or IFN-\u03b3-dependent histone acetylation of CIITA pIV in macrophages treated with inhibitors of MAPKs p38 or ERK. Thus, CIITA expression was inhibited by TLR2-induced MAPK signaling that caused histone hypoacetylation at CIITA pIV and suppression of CIITA transcription. Chromatin remodeling at MHC2TA is a novel target of inhibition by Mtb. These mechanisms may diminish class II MHC expression by infected macrophages, contributing to immune evasion by Mtb.",

            "abstract": "CD4+ T cell responses to aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection are characterized by the relatively delayed appearance of effector T cells in the lungs. This delay in the adaptive response is likely critical in allowing the bacteria to establish persistent infection. Because of limitations associated with the detection of low frequencies of na\u00efve T cells, it had not been possible to precisely determine when and where na\u00efve antigen-specific T cells are first activated. We have addressed this problem by using early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6)-specific transgenic CD4 T cells to monitor early T cell activation in vivo. By using an adoptive transfer approach, we directly show that T cell priming to ESAT-6 occurs only after 10 days of infection, is initially restricted to the mediastinal lymph nodes, and does not involve other lymph nodes or the lungs. Primed CD4 T cells rapidly differentiated into proliferating effector cells and ultimately acquired the ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 ex vivo. Initiation of T cell priming was enhanced by two full days depending on the magnitude of the challenge inoculum, which suggests that antigen availability is a factor limiting the early CD4 T cell response. These data define a key period in the adaptive immune response to Mtb infection.",

This delay in the adaptive response is likely critical in allowing the bacteria to establish persistent infection. Because of limitations associated with the detection of low frequencies of na\u00efve T cells, it had not been possible to precisely determine when and where na\u00efve antigen-specific T cells are first activated. We have addressed this problem by using early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6)-specific transgenic CD4 T cells to monitor early T cell activation in vivo. By using an adoptive transfer approach, we directly show that T cell priming to ESAT-6 occurs only after 10 days of infection, is initially restricted to the mediastinal lymph nodes, and does not involve other lymph nodes or the lungs. Primed CD4 T cells rapidly differentiated into proliferating effector cells and ultimately acquired the ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 ex vivo. Initiation of T cell priming was enhanced by two full days depending on the magnitude of the challenge inoculum, which suggests that antigen availability is a factor limiting the early CD4 T cell response.

Because the migratory paths of DCs are largely governed by the chemokine receptor CCR7, which is expressed on DCs upon maturation by proinflammatory stimuli, we examined the quantitative contribution of CCR7-dependent DC migration in the context of tuberculosis.

            "abstract": "Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node and requires transport of M. tuberculosis by migratory dendritic cells (DCs) to the local lymph node. The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

The previously published observations that 1) neutrophils are a transiently prominent population of M. tuberculosis-infected cells in the lungs early in infection and 2) that the peak of infected neutrophils immediately precedes the peak of infected DCs in the lungs prompted us to characterize the role of neutrophils in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis. We found that, although depletion of neutrophils in vivo increased the frequency of M. tuberculosis-infected DCs in the lungs, it decreased trafficking of DCs to the mediastinal lymph node. This resulted in delayed activation (CD69 expression) and proliferation of naive M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node. To further characterize the role of neutrophils in DC migration, we used a Transwell chemotaxis system and found that DCs that were directly infected by M. tuberculosis migrated poorly in response to CCL19, an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR7. In contrast, DCs that had acquired M. tuberculosis through uptake of infected neutrophils exhibited unimpaired migration. These results revealed a mechanism wherein neutrophils promote adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis by delivering M. tuberculosis to DCs in a form that makes DCs more effective initiators of naive CD4 T cell activation. These observations provide insight into a mechanism for neutrophils to facilitate initiation of adaptive immune responses in tuberculosis.",

The mechanisms preventing the development of a protective immune response against this parasite are unclear. Here we provide data demonstrating that parasite sequestration by neutrophils is responsible for disease progression in mice. Within hours of infection L. mexicana induced the local recruitment of neutrophils, which ingested parasites and formed extracellular traps without markedly impairing parasite survival. We further showed that the L. mexicana-induced recruitment of neutrophils impaired the early recruitment of dendritic cells at the site of infection as observed by intravital 2-photon microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Indeed, infection of neutropenic Genista mice and of mice depleted of neutrophils at the onset of infection demonstrated a prominent role for neutrophils in this process. Furthermore, an increase in monocyte-derived dendritic cells was also observed in draining lymph nodes of neutropenic mice, correlating with subsequent increased frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting T helper cells, and better parasite control leading ultimately to complete healing of the lesion. Altogether, these findings show that L. mexicana exploits neutrophils to block the induction of a protective immune response and impairs the control of lesion development. Our data thus demonstrate an unanticipated negative role for these innate immune cells in host defense, suggesting that in certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis, regulating neutrophil recruitment could be a strategy to promote lesion healing.",

Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain (LmSd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, LmSd elicited early upregulation of IL\u20101\u03b2 mRNA and IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin.

Infection of C57BL/6 mice with the L. major Seidman strain (LmSd), isolated from a patient with chronic lesions, despite eliciting a strong Th1 response, results in a nonhealing lesion, poor parasite clearance, and complete destruction of the ear dermis. We show here that in comparison to a healing strain, LmSd elicited early upregulation of IL\u20101\u03b2 mRNA and IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010producing dermal cells and prominent neutrophil recruitment to the infected skin. Mice deficient in Nlrp3, apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, or caspase\u20101/11, or lacking IL\u20101\u03b2 or IL\u20101 receptor signaling, developed healing lesions and cleared LmSd from the infection site.

In this paper, we show that a strain of Leishmania major (L. major Seidman [LmSd]) that produces nonhealing cutaneous lesions in conventionally resistant C57BL/6 mice was more efficiently taken up by M2-polarized bone marrow (BM)\u2013derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro and by mannose receptor (MR)hi dermal macrophages in vivo compared with a healing strain (L. major Friedlin V1). Both in steady and in T helper type 1 (Th1) cell\u2013driven inflammatory states, the MRhi dermal macrophages showed M2 characteristics. The dermal macrophages were radio resistant and not replaced by monocytes or adult BM-derived cells during infection, but were locally maintained by IL-4 and IL-10. Notably, the favored infection of M2 BMDMs by LmSd in vitro was MR dependent, and genetic deletion of MR or selective depletion of MRhi dermal macrophages by anti\u2013CSF-1 receptor antibody reversed the nonhealing phenotype. We conclude that embryonic-derived, MRhi dermal macrophages are permissive for parasite growth even in a strong Th1-immune environment, and the preferential infection of these cells plays a crucial role in the severity of cutaneous disease.",

            "abstract": "IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interaction with eosinophils maintains dermis-resident macrophages as replicative niches for Leishmania major. Tight tissue associations The intracellular pathogen Leishmania major has been found to replicate in dermal tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) that have an M2-like phenotype, but L. major also promotes a strong TH1 immune environment. Here, Lee et al. show that dermal TRMs can maintain an M2 phenotype in this TH1 environment through IL-4/CCL24\u2013mediated interactions with eosinophils. Eosinophils were identified as the main source of IL-4 that drove local proliferation of dermal TRMs with M2 properties. IL-4 and IL-10 stimulation of dermal TRMs triggered production of CCL24, which promoted further eosinophil recruitment and close interactions with TRMs. These observations provide insight into this intercellular interaction that may have relevance to other inflammatory conditions. Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) maintain tissue homeostasis, but they can also provide a replicative niche for intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. How dermal TRMs proliferate and maintain their M2 properties even in the strong TH1 environment of the L. major infected dermis is not clear. Here, we show that, in infected mice lacking IL-4/13 from eosinophils, dermal TRMs shifted to a proinflammatory state, their numbers declined, and disease was attenuated. Intravital microscopy revealed a rapid infiltration of eosinophils followed by their tight interaction with dermal TRMs. IL-4\u2013stimulated dermal TRMs, in concert with IL-10, produced a large amount of CCL24, which functioned to amplify eosinophil influx and their interaction with dermal TRMs. An intraperitoneal helminth infection model also demonstrated a requirement for eosinophil-derived IL-4 to maintain tissue macrophages through a CCL24-mediated amplification loop. CCL24 secretion was confined to resident macrophages in other tissues, implicating eosinophil-TRM cooperative interactions in diverse inflammatory settings.",

            "abstract": "The term \u2018macrophage\u2019 encompasses tissue cells that typically share dependence on the same transcriptional regulatory pathways (e.g. the transcription factor PU.1) and growth factors (e.g. CSF1/IL\u201034). They share a core set of functions that largely arise from a uniquely high phagocytic capacity manifest in their ability to clear dying cells, pathogens and scavenge damaged, toxic or modified host molecules. However, macrophages demonstrate a remarkable degree of tissue\u2010specific functionality and have diverse origins that vary by tissue site and inflammation status. With our understanding of this diversity has come an appreciation of the longevity and replicative capacity of tissue\u2010resident macrophages and thus the realisation that macrophages may persist through tissue perturbations and inflammatory events with important consequences for cell function. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the parameters that regulate macrophage survival and function, focusing on the relative importance of the tissue environment versus cell\u2010intrinsic factors, such as origin, how long a cell has been resident within a tissue and prior history of activation. Thus, we reconsider the view of macrophages as wholly plastic cells and raise many unanswered questions about the relative importance of cell life\u2010history versus environment in macrophage programming and function.",

            "abstract": "Rationale The role of circulating fetal monocytes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not known. We utilized a humanized mouse model that supports human progenitor cell engraftment (MISTRG) to test the hypothesis that prenatal monocyte programming alters early lung development and response to hyperoxia. Methods Cord blood-derived monocytes from 10 human infants were adoptively transferred into newborn MISTRG mice at p0 (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mouse, intrahepatic injection) followed by normoxia versus hyperoxia (85% oxygen\u2009\u00d7\u200914 days). Lungs were harvested at p14 for alveolar histology (alveolar count, perimeter and area) and vascular parameters (vWF staining for microvessel density, Fulton's index). Human CD45 staining was conducted to compare presence of hematopoietic cells. Murine lung parameters were compared among placebo and monocyte-injected groups. The individual profiles of the 10 patients were further considered, including gestational age (GA; n\u2009=\u20092 term, n\u2009=\u20093 moderate/late preterm, and n\u2009=\u20095 very preterm infants) and preeclampsia (n\u2009=\u20094 patients). To explore the monocyte microenvironment of these patients, 30 cytokines/chemokines were measured in corresponding human plasma by multiplex immunoassay. Results Across the majority of patients and corresponding mice, MISTRG alveolarization was simplified and microvessel density was decreased following hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced changes were seen in both placebo (PBS) and monocyte-injected mice. Under normoxic conditions, alveolar development was altered modestly by monocytes as compared with placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Monocyte injection was associated with increased microvessel density at P14 as compared with placebo (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 vs. 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vessels per lung field; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pooled analysis of patients revealed that injection of monocytes from births complicated by lower GA and preeclampsia was associated with changes in alveolarization and vascularization under normoxic conditions. These differences were modified by hyperoxia. CD45+ cell count was positively correlated with plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Immunohistochemical staining for human CD206 and mouse F4/80 confirmed absence of macrophages in MISTRG lungs at P14. Conclusions Despite the inherent absence of macrophages in early stages of lung development, immunodeficient MISTRG mice revealed changes in alveolar and microvascular development induced by human monocytes. MISTRG mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia may serve as a novel model to study isolated effects of human monocytes on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development.",
