        "title": "Exercise testing and cardiac rehabilitation in patients with coronary artery disease.",
        "abstract": "T HE exercise tolerance test records cardiovascular response to a measured exercise challenge and determines capacity to adapt to physical stress. The multilevel work load test should begin at a work level below the estimated cardiac impairment and should progress in stepwise fashion. Exercise should be maintained long enough to ensure that responses are stable. Blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram are continuously monitored and recorded. The answers obtained from an exercise test are: the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias and assessment of the heart's functional capacity to provide a patient surgical or medical treatment, including cardiac rehabilitation.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the use of exercise testing in cardiac rehabilitation for patients with coronary artery disease, which is a related topic to the source paper's focus on exercise programs after myocardial infarction. However, the paper does not specifically build upon or use the findings of the source paper as a sub-hypothesis. The connection is more general, as both papers deal with exercise and cardiac health."
