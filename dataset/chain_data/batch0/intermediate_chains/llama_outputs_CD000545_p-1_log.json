            "abstract": "EXTERNAL fistulas are a characteristic of Crohn\u2018s disease, occurring in I S -20 per cent of patients ( I . 2). They usually pass through the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. I ) but they can surface in the perineum or on the buttocks. In most instances the amount of discharge of pus and faeces from the fistula is small and some patients cope with it by wearing dressings rather than a bag. Nevertheless, it is often sufficient in quantity to cause sore skin and to soil clothing. Many of these patients have already undergone operations which have failed to control or have even provoked the fistula. Others have been told that their problem is not amenable to surgical treatment. a belief still held by some physicians and an occasional surgeon. and which is just not true. Virtually all external fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease can be successfully closed as long as certain basic rules are followed. However, it has to be admitted that an occasional fistula defies closure. and in others refistulation from a different site somctimes occurs. External fistulas in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease are of two types. Type I fistulas are those that arise from a segment of bowel, often the terminal ileum, involved by active disease. The inflamed bowel becomes attached to the abdominal wall which itself becomes inflamed and the site of abscess formation. The point of attachment is often in the right iliac fossa (Fig. I ) or to the inside of a laparotomy scar, especially when this has been recently performed (Fig. 2 ) . Such fistulas form following spontaneous or induced drainage of an abscess pointing on the abdominal surface. Type 1 fistulas nearly always require operation to close them. Tipe 2 fistulas are those that follow breakdown of an anastomosis undertaken following resection of bowel involved with Crohn\u2019s disease. Most fistulas of this type. given correct treatment, will heal spontaneously. In this respect their management differs fundamentally from type 1 fistulas.",

            "abstract": "Fifty\u2010two patients with Crohn's disease have been assessed using acute phase proteins and a scoring system. Thirty\u2010nine underwent operation and intra\u2010abdominal abscesses were found in seventeen. Both scores and acute phase proteins have been shown to reflect inflammation due to secondary sepsis in addition to that from active Crohn's disease. The scores were higher, and acute phase changes greater, in patients with sepsis than those without. By choosing a threshold for each variable that excludes patients without sepsis it has been found that a score > 181, ESR >45 mm/h, CRP >33 mg/l, orosomucoid >1.8g/l and albumin < 26.7 g/l identify sepsis with a specificity >95 per cent and sensitivity > 35 per cent. Over 70 per cent of patients with abscesses exceeded one or more of these thresholds. We believe that operative management should be strongly considered if one or more of these criteria are positive as such patients have a greater than 90 per cent chance of having an intra\u2010abdominal abscess. This will prevent these abscesses eroding into adjacent viscera or to the surface with resulting fistula formation.",

The serum concentrations of serum amyloid A protein (SAA), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1\u2010antichymotrypsin (alpha 1\u2010ACT) and alpha 1\u2010acid glycoprotein (alpha 1\u2010AGP) have been measured in eighty\u2010six patients with Crohn's disease, twenty\u2010five patients with ulcerative colitis and twenty\u2010two patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. In the Crohn's and ulcerative colitis group significant increases in concentration were observed in all four proteins, which parallelled disease severity as defined by other conventional laboratory parameters formulated into a simple activity index. In the irritable bowel group no significant changes were seen. Serum amyloid A and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease when mild, but did not differ significantly when severe. Serum amyloid A correlated well with CRP (r= 0\u00b783) and alpha 1\u2010ACT (r= 0\u00b780), but less well with alpha 1\u2010AGP (r= 0\u00b765). Serum amyloid A was the most sensitive protein (77%) but had the lowest specificity (74%). C\u2010reactive protein was less sensitive (58%) than SAA but had greater specificity (100%). Alpha 1\u2010ACT had a sensitivity and specificity similar to CRP and, therefore, provided little or no additional information. Alpha 1\u2010AGP, although also 100% specific, had the lowest sensitivity (34%) and, therefore, is probably the least useful acute phase monitor of inflammatory bowel disease. The role, and associated problems, of SAA measurements are discussed.",

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 of these patients to generate soluble interleukin-2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations of patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 19) were significantly elevated (757 +/- 438 U/ml) compared with levels in patients with inactive disease (n = 10; 412 +/- 120 U/ml) and healthy control individuals (n = 40; 375 +/- 102 U/ml; p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). Serial determinations of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration in a follow-up of 11 hospitalized patients treated for highly active disease showed a decrease from 1252 +/- 494 U/ml to 527 +/- 193 U/ml (p less than 0.004) that corresponded to clinical improvement, as assessed by Crohn's disease activity index and a reduction of inflammatory parameters. In vitro phytohemagglutinin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn's disease resulted in elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor production not only in patients with active disease (3987 +/- 2439 U/ml), but also in patients with inactive disease (3297 +/- 2282 U/ml), compared with the amount of soluble interleukin-2 receptor produced by mononuclear cells of healthy individuals (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, cultivation of mononuclear cells without mitogen resulted in higher soluble interleukin-2 receptor production in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.02). However, patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis also had significantly increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (1080 +/- 400 U/ml) compared with the levels in patients with chronic disease (455 +/- 140 U/ml; p less than 0.0025). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with ulcerative colitis produced significantly more soluble interleukin-2 receptor upon mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (2314 +/- 936 U/ml), than cells from healthy controls (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.05). The finding of elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels in patients with active Crohn's disease and its increased production by mononuclear cells of patients with both active and inactive disease is a further example of an alteration of the immune system in this condition; however, this alteration can also be found in other inflammatory bowel diseases.",

In addition, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of LPL\u2010T and peripheral blood T lymphocytes were determined by indirect immunofluorescenee using a panel of 11 TCR V\u03b2 specific antibodies. In most patients with inflammatory bowel disease, LPL\u2010T showed enhanced proliferation to antigen receptor stimulation compared with controls. Moreover, perhaps as a consequence, an enhanced frequency of in vivo preactivated T cells was seen as judged from an increased spontaneous proliferative response to low concentrations of exogenous IL\u20102. LPL\u2010T and peripheral blood T lymphocytes exhibited similar percentages of TCR V\u03b2 gene usage both in controls and in patients. In summary, polyclonal activation of LPL\u2010T due to impairment of local adjustment, i.e. insufficient down\u2010regulation of TCR/CD3\u2010dependent signalling processes, may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.",

            "abstract": "T cell hypersensitivity has been implicated in the tissue damage in Crohn's disease (CD). All studies to date have examined mucosal T cells, although much of the tissue damage occurs in the submucosa and muscle layers. The aim of this work was to study T cell proliferation throughout the intestinal wall in children with IBD. Surgical resection material from 19 children with CD (10 ileal, 10 colonic), seven with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 12 normal controls was studied. The distribution of dividing T cells was investigated by double\u2010immunohistochemistry using Ki67 to identify proliferating cells, and CD3 to identify T cells. In ileal and colonic lamina propria virtually no Ki67+, CD3+ cells were seen in control, UC or CD tissue. In contrast, there were significantly more Ki67+, CD3+ cells within the lymphoid follicles of ileal and colonic CD than in the follicles in UC and controls. Increased numbers of Ki67+, CD3+ cells were present in the submucosa, muscle layers (M) and serosa in Crohn's ileitis and colitis compared with the lamina propria (LP), although only in the muscle of the colon was the difference statistically significant (LP, 0.4% (0\u20131%); M, 1.6% (0\u20135.2%); P\u2003=\u20030.03). Pooling data from ileal and colonic CD, however, did show significantly increased Ki67+, CD3+ cells in both serosa and muscle layers compared with the LP. Dividing T cells have been identified in the deeper layers of the gut wall in CD. These may contribute to the fibrosis and muscle hyperplasia characteristic of the condition.",

            "abstract": "Summary: Experimental data indicate that mucosal CD4+ T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Based on the pattern of cytokine production, CD4+ T cells may be distinguished into two different phenotypes. Th1 responses are characterized by secretion of interleukin (IL)\u20102, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr;, lymphotoxin, and interferon (IFN)\u2010&ggr; and are associated with delayedtype hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Th2 responses, which are characterized by secretion of IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010, have been associated with humoral immune responses and allergy. To assess the number of IFN\u2010&agr; and IL\u20104 positive cells in IBD and normal intestinal specimens, frozen sections from intestinal specimens from 10 Crohn's disease (CD), 8 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 healthy controls were examined by immunohistochemistry. Monoclonal antibodies for CD3, CD8, IFN\u2010&ggr;, and IL\u20104 were used. T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration and cytokine expression by epithelial, lamina propria, and submucosal cells were scored on a four\u2010point scale by two independent observers who were blinded for the clinical data. One\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was used for statistical analysis. In intestinal specimens from IBD patients, the number of CD3+ cells was found increased in the lamina propria and, within the submucosa, this increase was significant (p < 0.001). In CD the number of lamina propria IFN\u2010&ggr; positive cells was significantly increased as compared with controls (p < 0.002). In UC the number of both IFN\u2010&ggr; and IL\u20104 producing cells in the lamina propria was not significantly increased as compared with controls. The present results confirm the existence of a Thl\u2010biased pattern production in CD but not in UC.",

            "abstract": "Recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) to lymph nodes (LNs) is pivotal to the establishment of immune response. Whereas DCs have been proven to undergo afferent lymphatic pathway to enter LNs from peripheral tissues, a question remains if DCs also migrate into LNs directly from the circulation. Here we demonstrate that plasmacytoid DC (pDC) precursors can transmigrate across high endothelial venules (HEVs) of inflamed LNs in mice. Bacterial infection induces a significant number of pDC and myeloid DC (mDC) precursors into the circulation. Both subsets express a common set of chemokine receptors except CXCR3, display parallel mobilization into the blood, but show distinct trafficking pathway to the LNs. In a short-term homing assay, whereas mDC precursors migrate to peripheral tissues and subsequently to draining LNs, pDC precursors directly enter the LNs in a CXCL9 and E-selectin dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha controls not only DC precursor mobilization into the blood but also chemokine up-regulation on LN HEVs. A similar trafficking pathway is observed also in viral infection, and CXCR3(-/-) mice-derived pDC precursors show defective trans-HEV migration. This study clarifies the inflammation-dependent, chemokine-driven distinct property of DC precursor trafficking.",

Whereas DCs have been proven to undergo afferent lymphatic pathway to enter LNs from peripheral tissues, a question remains if DCs also migrate into LNs directly from the circulation. Here we demonstrate that plasmacytoid DC (pDC) precursors can transmigrate across high endothelial venules (HEVs) of inflamed LNs in mice. Bacterial infection induces a significant number of pDC and myeloid DC (mDC) precursors into the circulation. Both subsets express a common set of chemokine receptors except CXCR3, display parallel mobilization into the blood, but show distinct trafficking pathway to the LNs. In a short-term homing assay, whereas mDC precursors migrate to peripheral tissues and subsequently to draining LNs, pDC precursors directly enter the LNs in a CXCL9 and E-selectin dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha controls not only DC precursor mobilization into the blood but also chemokine up-regulation on LN HEVs. A similar trafficking pathway is observed also in viral infection, and CXCR3(-/-) mice-derived pDC precursors show defective trans-HEV migration.

            "abstract": "Antiviral cell\u2013mediated immunity is initiated by the dendritic cell (DC) network in lymph nodes (LNs). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are known to migrate to inflamed LNs and produce interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, but their other roles in antiviral T cell immunity are unclear. We report that LN-recruited pDCs are activated to create local immune fields that generate antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in association with LNDCs, in a model of cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Although pDCs alone failed to induce CTLs, in vivo depletion of pDCs impaired CTL-mediated virus eradication. LNDCs from pDC-depleted mice showed impaired cluster formation with T cells and antigen presentation to prime CTLs.

Transferring circulating pDC precursors from wild-type, but not CXCR3-deficient, mice to pDC-depleted mice restored CTL induction by impaired LNDCs. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that pDCs provided help signals that recovered impaired LNDCs in a CD2- and CD40L-dependent manner. pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 further stimulated the recovered LNDCs to induce CTLs. Therefore, the help provided by pDCs for LNDCs in primary immune responses seems to be pivotal to optimally inducing anti-HSV CTLs.",

DCs serve as critical links between the innate and adaptive immune responses against many pathogens, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The role of DCs as mediators of resistance to HSV-1 infection was investigated using CD11c-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, in which DCs can be transiently depleted in vivo by treatment with low doses of DT. We show that ablation of DCs led to enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the highly resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. Specifically, we showed that the depletion of DCs led to increased viral spread into the nervous system, resulting in an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we showed that ablation of DCs impaired the optimal activation of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to HSV-1. These data demonstrated that DCs were essential not only in the optimal activation of the acquired T-cell response to HSV-1 but also that DCs were crucial for innate resistance to HSV-1 infection.",

            "abstract": "The chemokine, CXCL10, chemotactic for NK cells, activated T cells, and dendritic cells is highly expressed during viral infections, including HSV-1. The importance of this chemokine to the control of HSV-1 infection was tested using mice deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10\u2212/\u2212). Following corneal infection, HSV-1 viral titers were elevated in the nervous system of CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment including dendritic cells, NK cells, and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain stem. In the absence of NK cells and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in wild-type (WT) or CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, similar levels of virus were recovered in the nervous system, suggesting these cells are responsible for the observed defects in the control of viral replication in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Leukocyte mobilization was also compared between WT, CXCL10\u2212/\u2212, and mice deficient in the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212). NK cell mobilization was comparably reduced in both CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 and CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to WT animals. However, the reduction in mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 was not observed in CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice following HSV-1 infection. The defect was not the result of an alternative receptor for CXCL10, as Ag-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment was not reduced in mice which were deficient in both CXCL10 and CXCR3. Thus, CXCL10 deficiency results in reduced mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells as a result of dysregulation of CXCR3 signaling.",

            "abstract": "The chemokine, CXCL10, chemotactic for NK cells, activated T cells, and dendritic cells is highly expressed during viral infections, including HSV-1. The importance of this chemokine to the control of HSV-1 infection was tested using mice deficient in CXCL10 (CXCL10\u2212/\u2212). Following corneal infection, HSV-1 viral titers were elevated in the nervous system of CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte recruitment including dendritic cells, NK cells, and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain stem. In the absence of NK cells and HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in wild-type (WT) or CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice, similar levels of virus were recovered in the nervous system, suggesting these cells are responsible for the observed defects in the control of viral replication in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Leukocyte mobilization was also compared between WT, CXCL10\u2212/\u2212, and mice deficient in the only known receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212). NK cell mobilization was comparably reduced in both CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 and CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to WT animals. However, the reduction in mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 was not observed in CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice following HSV-1 infection. The defect was not the result of an alternative receptor for CXCL10, as Ag-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment was not reduced in mice which were deficient in both CXCL10 and CXCR3. Thus, CXCL10 deficiency results in reduced mobilization of HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells as a result of dysregulation of CXCR3 signaling.",

Signaling through gamma interferon-regulated chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCR3 plays a critical role in the immune response of many viral pathogens. However, the relevance of CXCR3 for optimal T-cell activation and the induction of regulatory transcription factors (i.e., T-bet and eomesodermin) relative to host immune defense against genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection have been poorly defined. In this study, we evaluated the requirement of CXCR3 expression during genital HSV-2 infection using mice deficient in CXCR3 (CXCR3\u2212/\u2212) along with wild-type (WT) controls, assessing the resistance of mice to viral infection and focusing on the cytokine/chemokine response, phenotypic analysis of recruited leukocytes, and functional analysis of CD8+ T cells. CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a heightened sensitivity to infection compared to WT animals in terms of the viral burden in infected tissues as well as elevated mortality. The poor response of CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice to viral infection was associated with reduced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity through the impairment of T-bet, perforin, and granzyme B expression by CD8+ T cells. Corresponding with the defective cytolytic activity, a reduction in recruitment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CD80 expression in CD11c+ dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice were detected. Collectively, the results provide a new perspective to CXCR3 signaling for the appropriate activation of CD8+ T cells required for host defense against genital HSV-2 infection.",

We show that CXCL10 plays a role during CD8+ T cell priming in the mouse. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed the Cxcl10 gene as a target of CD27/CD70 costimulation in newly activated CD8+ T cells. CD27/CD70 costimulation is known to promote activated T cell survival, but CXCL10 did not affect survival or proliferation of primed CD8+ T cells in vitro. Accordingly, CXCL10 could not fully rescue CD27 deficiency in mice infected with influenza virus. Rather, CXCL10 acted as chemoattractant for other activated CD8+ T cells. It signaled downstream of CD27 in a paracrine fashion to promote generation of the CD8+ effector T cell pool in the Ag-draining lymph nodes.

            "abstract": "A broad spectrum of diseases is characterized by myelin abnormalities and/or oligodendrocyte pathology. In most, if not all, of these diseases, early activation of microglia occurs. Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering early microglia activation is, however, incomplete. In this study, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the temporal and causal relationship of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and early microglia activation. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed the induction of distinct chemokines, among them Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Early microglia activation was unchanged in CCL2- and CCL3-deficient knockouts, but was significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice, resulting in an amelioration of cuprizone toxicity at later time points. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that recombinant CXCL10 induced migration and a proinflammatory phenotype in cultured microglia, without affecting their phagocytic activity or proliferation. In situ hybridization analyses suggest that Cxcl10 mRNA is mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also oligodendrocytes, in short-term cuprizone-exposed mice. Our results show that CXCL10 actively participates in the initiation of microglial activation. These findings have implications for the role of CXCL10 as an important mediator during the initiation of neuroinflammatory processes associated with oligodendrocyte pathology.",

            "abstract": "A broad spectrum of diseases is characterized by myelin abnormalities and/or oligodendrocyte pathology. In most, if not all, of these diseases, early activation of microglia occurs. Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering early microglia activation is, however, incomplete. In this study, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the temporal and causal relationship of oligodendrocyte apoptosis and early microglia activation. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed the induction of distinct chemokines, among them Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Early microglia activation was unchanged in CCL2- and CCL3-deficient knockouts, but was significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice, resulting in an amelioration of cuprizone toxicity at later time points. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that recombinant CXCL10 induced migration and a proinflammatory phenotype in cultured microglia, without affecting their phagocytic activity or proliferation. In situ hybridization analyses suggest that Cxcl10 mRNA is mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also oligodendrocytes, in short-term cuprizone-exposed mice. Our results show that CXCL10 actively participates in the initiation of microglial activation. These findings have implications for the role of CXCL10 as an important mediator during the initiation of neuroinflammatory processes associated with oligodendrocyte pathology.",

Following the discovery that AQP4 is a possible autoantigen in neuromyelitis optica, the function of AQP4 in health and disease has become a research focus. While several studies have addressed the expression and function of AQP4 during inflammatory demyelination, relatively little is known about its expression during non-autoimmune-mediated myelin damage. In this study, we used the toxin-induced demyelination model cuprizone as well as a combination of metabolic and autoimmune myelin injury (i.e., Cup/EAE) to investigate AQP4 pathology. We show that during toxin-induced demyelination, diffuse AQP4 expression increases, while polarized AQP4 expression at the astrocyte endfeet decreases. The diffuse increased expression of AQP4 was verified in chronic-active multiple sclerosis lesions. Around inflammatory brain lesions, AQP4 expression dramatically decreased, especially at sites where peripheral immune cells penetrate the brain parenchyma. Humoral immune responses appear not to be involved in this process since no anti-AQP4 antibodies were detected in the serum of the experimental mice. We provide strong evidence that the diffuse increase in anti-AQP4 staining intensity is due to a metabolic injury to the brain, whereas the focal, perivascular loss of anti-AQP4 immunoreactivity is mediated by peripheral immune cells.",
