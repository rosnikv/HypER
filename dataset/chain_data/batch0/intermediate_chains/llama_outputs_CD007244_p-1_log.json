            "abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the effect of periodized exercise training with and without Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) on bone mineral density (BMD) and 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in early postmenopausal women. Methods:A total of 128 women were randomly assigned to three subgroups: exercise (EG, n = 43), exercise and CR supplementation (EGCR, n = 43), and wellness control (control group [CG], n = 42). Both exercise groups performed a periodized exercise program with high-intensity-resistance/high-impact exercise dedicated to bone parameters interspersed by blocks of 10 weeks of training focusing on CHD parameters. In addition to the exercise program, the EGCR was supplemented with 40 mg/day of CR according to the specification of the manufacturer. A low-intensity exercise program of 60 minutes per week for a period of 10 weeks interspersed with 10-week blocks without exercise was performed in the CG. Primary endpoints were BMD and 10-year CHD risk proposed by Wilson. Secondary endpoints were body composition and menopausal symptoms. Results:BMD at the lumbar spine was maintained in both exercise groups (EG, \u22120.1% \u00b1 2.2%, P = 0.74; EGCR, \u22120.4% \u00b1 2.4%, P = 0.40) and significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the CG (2.0% \u00b1 2.0%). Both exercise groups significantly differed from the CG (P = 0.001 and 0.005 for the EG and EGCR, respectively); however, no differences between the exercise groups with and without CR was determined. Although slight increases in femoral neck BMD were determined in both exercise groups (EG, 0.5% \u00b1 3.0%, P = 0.36; EGCR, 0.4% \u00b1 3.1%, P = 0.52), a reduction was assessed in the CG (\u22120.6% \u00b1 2.7%, P = 0.29). No significant differences were determined between the groups. The 10-year CHD risk significantly increased in the EGCR (12.9% \u00b1 25.1%, P = 0.018) and in the CG (16.5% \u00b1 27.8%, P = 0.007). The EG did not show corresponding changes (\u22122.7% \u00b1 21.9%, P = 0.60). However, no significant between-group differences were observed. Conclusions:In conclusion our exercise program favorably affected bone, menopausal symptoms, lean body mass, and, to a smaller extent, 10-year CHD risk in early postmenopausal women. Adjuvant supplementation of CR did not enhance these positive effects.",

Based on the 12\u2010year results of the consequently supervised exercise group (EG) of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study, we retrospectively structured two exercise groups according to the overall exercise frequency. Changes in aBMD at lumbar spine and proximal femur as assessed by dual\u2010energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry technique were compared between a low\u2010frequency exercise group (LEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200916) with 1.5\u2013<2 sessions/week and a high\u2010frequency exercise group (HEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200925) with \u22652\u20133.5 sessions/week. Changes in aBMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur were significantly more favorable in the HEF\u2010EG compared with the LEF\u2010EG; lumbar spine: (mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7% vs \u22124.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.001, ES: d'\u2009=\u20091.26; total hip: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs \u22126.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.045, ES: d'\u2009=\u20090.70). BMD results of the LEF\u2010EG did not significantly differ from the data of the non\u2010training control group (lumbar spine: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2%, total hip: \u22126.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0%). Although this result might not be generalizable across all exercise types and cohorts, it indicates that to impact bone, an overall exercise frequency of at least 2 sessions/week may be crucial, even if exercise is applied with high intensity/impact.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the long\u2010term dose\u2013response relationship of exercise frequency on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in early post\u2010menopausal women with osteopenia. Based on the 12\u2010year results of the consequently supervised exercise group (EG) of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study, we retrospectively structured two exercise groups according to the overall exercise frequency. Changes in aBMD at lumbar spine and proximal femur as assessed by dual\u2010energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry technique were compared between a low\u2010frequency exercise group (LEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200916) with 1.5\u2013<2 sessions/week and a high\u2010frequency exercise group (HEF\u2010EG, n\u2009=\u200925) with \u22652\u20133.5 sessions/week. Changes in aBMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur were significantly more favorable in the HEF\u2010EG compared with the LEF\u2010EG; lumbar spine: (mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7% vs \u22124.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.001, ES: d'\u2009=\u20091.26; total hip: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs \u22126.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.045, ES: d'\u2009=\u20090.70). BMD results of the LEF\u2010EG did not significantly differ from the data of the non\u2010training control group (lumbar spine: \u22124.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2%, total hip: \u22126.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0%). Although this result might not be generalizable across all exercise types and cohorts, it indicates that to impact bone, an overall exercise frequency of at least 2 sessions/week may be crucial, even if exercise is applied with high intensity/impact.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that physical exercise can prevent fractures in postmenopausal women. However, even with careful adaptation of the exercise program to subjects' changing bone, health, and fitness status, effectivity may still decrease over the time. This could be specifically the case where the limitations of higher age collide with the specification of the exercise program. Thus, the aim of this study was to monitor bone mineral density (BMD) changes over a 16\u2010year period of supervised exercise. Our hypothesis was that BMD differences at lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) between exercisers (EG) and nontraining controls (CG) increased throughout the intervention with significant differences for each of the four 4\u2010year observation periods. Sixty\u2010seven (EG, n = 39 versus CG, n = 28) initially early\u2010postmenopausal osteopenic women of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study (EFOPS) with complete BMD data sets for baseline (1998) and 4\u2010, 8\u2010, 12\u2010, and 16\u2010year follow\u2010up were included in the analysis. The exercise protocol initially focused on a high\u2010intensity strategy that addressed bone but increasingly shifted to a more comprehensive intervention. LS\u2010BMD differences between the EG and CG continuously increased (year 4: 2.4% (95%\u2010 Confidence Interval 1.0% to 3.8%), year 8: 3.1% (1.6% to 4.7%), year 12: 3.9% (1.9% to 5.8), year 16: 4.5% (2.5% to 6.6%). Correspondingly, rising differences for FN\u2010BMD (0.9% (\u20130.2% to 2.1%) versus 1.9% (0.4% to 3.3%) versus 2.0% (0.5% to 3.8%) versus 3.0% (1.0% to 5.0%)) were observed. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, group differences within the four 4\u2010year periods were not consistently significant (LS, p = 0.001 to 0.097; FN, p = 0.026 to 0.673); further, BMD kinetics among the groups varied between LS and FN. Of particular importance, significant differences (p \u2264 0.030) for both regions were still found in the final period. We conclude that exercise\u2014even when adapted for subjects' decreasing bone, health, and fitness status\u2014is consistently effective in favorably affecting BMD in (initially) early\u2010postmenopausal osteopenic women without any leveling\u2010off effect after 16 years of exercise. \u00a9 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

            "abstract": "Objective: We investigated the effectiveness of a 12-week SaBang-DolGi walking exercise program on the physical and mental health of menopausal women and aimed to provide the basic data needed to develop health promotion programs for the active and healthy aging of menopausal women. Materials and methods: The participants comprised 40 women aged 50\u201365 years who were divided into two randomly selected groups in training sessions (exercising group, n = 21 and control group, n = 19). A physical (grip, muscle and endurance) test and mental health test (simple mental health test II) were conducted using questionnaires with the aim of examining subjects\u2019 physical and mental health before and after exercise. Results: After the intervention, the participants experienced positive changes in the physical dimension, with significant enhancements particularly in mental well-being and menopause-related health and subdomains. Controlled and regular exercise for 12 weeks was significantly correlated with a positive change in vitality and mental health. Conclusions: We found that the SaBang-DolGi walking exercise program helps to promote the physical and mental health of menopausal women who are exposed to the various stresses and depressions that accompany physical deterioration; the program was found to encourage active and healthy aging.",
