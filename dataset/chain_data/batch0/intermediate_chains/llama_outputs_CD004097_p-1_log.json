Design and Subjects.This was a 2 \u00d7 2 randomized, controlled trial investigating the incremental effects of telephone follow-up and community resources enhancement with 320 adult type 2 diabetes outpatients. Methods.Key outcomes included behavioral (dietary patterns, fat intake), physiologic (HbA1C, lipids), and quality-of-life/patient satisfaction measures and were collected at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results.Despite high reach (76% patient participation), excellent adoption (all 12 primary care practices approached participated), and good implementation, there were few outcome differences among treatment conditions. There was significant improvement across conditions in most outcomes in each category at both follow-ups. Conclusions.A brief, computer-assisted, dietary goal\u2013setting intervention basic treatment condition was moderately successful in producing dietary improvements but less so in producing biologic or quality-of-life outcomes. Additions of follow-up phone calls or a community resources enhancement component did not produce incremental improvements over this basic intervention.",

Healthy women HMO members (n = 616) aged 40 to 70. Intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to nutrition intervention or an attention-control intervention unrelated to diet. Intervention consisted of two 45-minute counseling sessions plus two 5- to 10-minute follow-up telephone contacts. Counseling sessions included a 20-minute, interactive, computer-based intervention using a touchscreen format. Intervention goals were reducing dietary fat and increasing consumption of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Measures. Twenty-four hour diet recalls and the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire (FFB). Results. Four-month follow-up data were collected from 94% of the intervention participants and 91% of the controls. Testing with a multivariate general linear models analysis showed improvements on all dietary outcome variables. Compared to the control, intervention participants reported significantly less fat consumption (2.35 percentage points less for percentage of energy from fat), significantly greater consumption of fruit and vegetables combined (1.04 servings per day), and a significant reduction in a behavioral measure of fat consumption (.24 point change in the FFB). Conclusions. These 4-month results are comparable to several other moderate-intensity studies showing that, in the appropriate circumstances, moderate-intensity dietary interventions can be efficacious. Study limitations include the short follow-up period and the use of self-reported outcome measures.",

            "abstract": "Whole-grain rye and wheat products are rich in lignans, the precursors of enterolactone (ENL) and alkylresorcinols (ARs), which are phenolic lipids. In this crossover trial, we examined the effect of whole-grain rye bread compared with low-fiber wheat bread on plasma AR levels. Women (n = 39) aged 59 +/- 0.94 y (mean +/- SEM) were advised to consume rye (214 +/- 7.1 g/d) or wheat (178 +/- 6.5 g/d) bread (20% of total daily energy intake) in random order for 8 wk. The test periods were separated by an 8-wk washout period. ARs with different homologues and ENL were measured in plasma collected at the beginning (habitual diet) and end of the test bread periods. AR concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) after the rye bread (352 +/- 24.7 nmol/L) and habitual diet (97.7 +/- 12.1 and 88.3 +/- 8.7 nmol/L) periods than after the wheat bread period (36.6 +/- 4.2 nmol/L). Plasma AR concentrations were correlated with intake of rye bread (r = 0.34, P = 0.037), and with insoluble fiber from the whole diet during the rye (r = 0.39, P = 0.013) and wheat (r = 0.32, P = 0.047) bread periods. The plasma AR 17:0/21:0 ratio differed after the rye (0.84 +/- 0.04) and wheat (0.53 +/- 0.08) bread diet periods (P < 0.001). These data strongly suggest that plasma ARs could be used as specific biomarkers for whole-grain rye intake, and their homologue pattern could be used as an indicator of the bread type consumed.",

Concentrations in human plasma have been suggested to be biomarkers of dietary whole-grain intake. We measured human plasma, erythrocyte, and lipoprotein alkylresorcinol concentrations and alkylresorcinol homolog distribution, and evaluated the use of plasma alkylresorcinol concentration as a dietary biomarker of whole-grain intake compared with serum enterolactone. A total of 15 subjects (8 women) consumed whole-grain wheat or whole-grain rye crisp bread ( approximately 100 g/d) in a crossover design for 1 wk. The test bread periods were preceded by 1-wk periods of consuming refined wheat bread. Plasma, erythrocyte, lipoprotein alkylresorcinol, and serum enterolactone concentrations were measured before and after each period, and plasma alkylresorcinols and serum enterolactone were measured after habitual diet intake before and 1 wk after the trial. Plasma alkylresorcinols are transported in lipoproteins with VLDL and HDL being the main carriers. AR concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, and lipoproteins were increased (P < 0.05) by whole-grain wheat bread and even more so with rye crisp bread, although interindividual variation was high. The alkylresorcinol homolog C17:0 to C21:0 ratio in plasma was higher after the whole-grain rye diet period compared with the whole-grain wheat diet period (P < 0.05). Serum enterolactone concentrations were increased significantly by whole-grain rye intake only in men. This is the first report to show that alkylresorcinols in human plasma are mainly transported in lipoproteins. The plasma alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 ratio reflects intake of whole-grain wheat and rye, and the plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration appears to be a useful biomarker of whole-grain cereal intake.",

            "abstract": "Biomarkers of dietary intake are prominent tools in nutritional research. The alkylresorcinol metabolites 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (3,5-DHPPA) have been proposed as exposure biomarkers of whole-grain (WG) wheat and rye intake. However, the profile of alkylresorcinol metabolites is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of alkylresorcinols in mice and in humans, while further determining urinary pharmacokinetics of the novel alkylresorcinol metabolites to explore their potential as biomarkers of WG wheat intake. Utilization of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach resulted in 10 alkylresorcinol metabolites identified in mice and in humans, including 3 phenolic acids and 7 of their phase II conjugates. Among them, 2 novel metabolites were discovered: 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (3,5-DHPPTA) and 2-(3,5-dihydroxybenzamido)acetic acid (3,5-DHBA glycine). The structures of these 2 metabolites were confirmed by comparing with authentic standards synthesized in-house. In the pharmacokinetic study, a group of 12 volunteers consumed a polyphenolic-restricted diet for 4 d before ingesting WG wheat bread containing 61 mg of alkylresorcinols. Urine samples were collected for 32 h, and alkylresorcinol metabolites were quantified with HPLC-coulometric electrode array detection. The mean urinary excretion rates and mean apparent half-life of 3,5-DHPPTA, 3,5-DHBA glycine, 3,5-DHBA, and 3,5-DHPPA at each time point were determined. Our results suggest that 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine may be used in combination with 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHPPA as potential biomarkers to increase the accuracy of recording WG wheat and rye intake in epidemiologic studies. Further validation of 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine as potential biomarkers is warranted.",

The paper's focus on alkylresorcinol metabolites is directly related to the source paper's investigation of plasma alkylresorcinols as a biomarker for whole grain intake, and the paper's findings could be seen as building on the source paper's research."
