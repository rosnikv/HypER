            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWeight loss is associated with accelerated mortality and disease progression in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although studies have examined a variety of anabolic therapies in HIV-infected men, the safety and efficacy of such treatments in women have not been adequately studied.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase I/II study, 38 HIV-infected women with documented weight loss of 5% or greater in the preceding year or a body mass index of less than 20 kg/m(2) were randomized to receive nandrolone decanoate (100 mg) or an equivalent volume of placebo every other week by intramuscular injection. Subjects received blinded treatment for 12 weeks, followed by open-label therapy for 12 weeks. Lean body mass and fat (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and weight were measured at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Biochemical assessments of safety (hematologic analyses, liver function tests, and sex hormone measurements) were performed at these same time points. Clinical signs and symptoms were monitored biweekly.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects randomized to receive nandrolone had significant increases in weight and lean body mass during blinded treatment (4.6 kg [9.0%] and 3.5 kg [8.6%], respectively; P<.001 vs baseline and placebo in each case). Fat mass did not change statistically significantly in either group. Although there were no statistically significant differences between groups in biochemical measures, the number of grade 3 or greater toxicities, or reports of virilizing effects, a full assessment of safety cannot be made in a trial of this size.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNandrolone decanoate therapy may prove to be generally safe and beneficial in reversing weight loss and lean tissue loss in women with HIV infection and other chronic catabolic diseases.",

Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred sixty-two HIV-infected men with documented 10% to 20% weight loss or body mass index \u226420 kg/m2 were randomized to placebo or to 20, 40, or 80 mg of oxandrolone daily. After 12 weeks, subjects were allowed to receive open-label oxandrolone at a dose of 20 mg for another 12 weeks. Results: Body weight increased in all groups, including the group receiving placebo, during the double-blind phase (1.1 \u00b1 2.7, 1.8 \u00b1 3.9, 2.8 \u00b1 3.3, and 2.3 \u00b1 2.9 kg in placebo and 20-, 40-, and 80-mg oxandrolone groups, respectively; all P < 0.014 vs. baseline). BCM increased from baseline in all groups (0.45 \u00b1 1.7, 0.91 \u00b1 2.2, 1.5 \u00b1 2.5, and 1.8 \u00b1 1.8 kg in placebo and 20-, 40-, and 80-mg oxandrolone groups, respectively). At 12 weeks, only the gain in weight at the 40-mg dose of oxandrolone and the gain in BCM at the 40- and 80-mg doses of oxandrolone were greater than those in the placebo group, however. Oxandrolone treatment was associated with significant suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and total and free testosterone levels. Treatment was generally well tolerated but accompanied by significant increases in transaminases and low-density lipoprotein as well as decreases in high-density lipoprotein. Conclusion: Oxandrolone administration is effective in promoting dose-dependent gains in body weight and BCM in HIV-infected men with weight loss.",

            "abstract": "Background Testosterone (T) deficiency remains a poorly understood issue in men with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). We investigated the gonadal status in HIV-infected men in order to characterize T deficiency and to identify predictive factors for low serum T. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a cross-sectional, observational study on 1325 consecutive HIV male outpatients, most of them having lipodystrophy. Serum total T<300 ng/dL was used as the threshold for biochemical T deficiency. Morning serum total T, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, HIV parameters, and body composition parameters by CT-scan and Dual-Energy-X-ray-Absorptiometry were measured in each case. Sexual behavior was evaluated in a subset of 247 patients. T deficiency was found in 212 subjects, especially in the age range 40\u201359, but was frequent even in younger patients. T deficiency occurred mainly in association with low/normal serum LH. Adiposity was higher in subjects with T deficiency (p<0.0001) and both visceral adipose tissue and body mass index were the main negative predictors of serum total T. Osteoporosis and erectile dysfunction were present in a similar percentage in men with or without T deficiency. Conclusions/Significance Premature decline of serum T is common (16%) among young/middle-aged HIV-infected men and is associated with inappropriately low/normal LH and increased visceral fat. T deficiency occurs at a young age and may be considered an element of the process of premature or accelerated aging known to be associated with HIV infection. The role of HIV and/or HIV infection treatments, as well as the role of the general health state on the gonadal axis, remains, in fact, to be elucidated. Due to the low specificity of signs and symptoms of hypogonadism in the context of HIV, caution is needed in the diagnosis of hypogonadism in HIV-infected men with biochemical low serum T levels.",

A cutoff score of \u226425 of the erectile domain was used to diagnose ED. Serum testosterone, demographic, and anthropometric (weight, height, and body mass index [BMI]) characteristics were obtained from all participants. Statistics included the T-test, the Fisher's test, univariable and multivariable logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate Spearman's correlation analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe HIV-uninfected group was significantly younger than the HIV-infected group and presented a higher BMI (P\u2003<\u20030.001). The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe ED was higher in HIV-infected men than in HIV-uninfected men of all decades of age.

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is more prevalent in men living with HIV (MLHIV) when compared with age-matched HIV-negative men. This may be related to a premature decline in testosterone levels. In the general population, ED has been associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of ED, testosterone deficiency, and risk of CHD in a cohort of young to middle-aged MLHIV in Belgium.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional, observational study among 244 MLHIV attending the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe short version of the international index of erectile function (IIEF-5) questionnaire diagnosed ED (cutoff score \u2264 21). The 10-year risk score for CHD was calculated. In a subset of men reporting ED, the calculated free testosterone (CFT) was determined using Vermeulen's formula. Testosterone deficiency was defined as CFT <0.22 nmol/L.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred fifty-one men (61.9%) self-reported ED (median IIEF-5 score: 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 12-19]). In multivariate analysis, only increasing age, but none of the HIV-related parameters, nor any of the individual cardiovascular-risk related parameters, was statistically significantly associated with ED. Eighteen out of the 49 (36.7%) men with ED who received a blood test to assess testosterone levels were diagnosed with testosterone deficiency. The 10-year risk of CHD in the cohort was 4.3% (IQR 3.6-5.7) and was significantly higher in men with ED (5.1%, IQR 4.4-6.6) compared with men without ED (3.1%, IQR 2.5-4.2).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study showed that ED and testosterone deficiency are highly prevalent in young to middle-aged MLHIV and that ED might be associated with an increased risk of CHD. Therefore, healthcare professionals should screen for clinical ED and should consider testing for underlying testosterone deficiency. A clinical diagnosis of ED should trigger a full evaluation of the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, even at younger age.",

Prevalence was obtained from cross-sectional studies, and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a standardized method, was used to assess ED. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed in the HIV clinic. Participants completed the IIEF to allow ED assessment. Information on demographics, clinical and HIV-related variables was retrieved from their medical records. Results. One hundred and nine patients were included, with a mean age of 39.9 \u00b1 8.8 years. ED was present in 65.1% of the individuals. Patients had been diagnosed with HIV for a mean of 92.7 \u00b1 70.3 months and had undergone a mean 56.4 \u00b1 45.5 months of HAART. The only variable associated with ED in the univariate analysis was dyslipidemia, and this association was also found in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.01). Conclusions. ED is highly prevalent in HIV patients. Dyslipidemia should be considered as a risk factor for ED in HIV patients.

The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function\u20135 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence.",
