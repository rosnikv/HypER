            "abstract": "This study aimed to examine penetration of the blind in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Neurologists' ratings of improvement and medication side-effects, participants' ratings of improvement and daily diary recordings of headaches were assessed along with participants' and neurologists' guesses about treatment group placement in participants who completed at least 3 months of treatment (N = 169). Despite blinding, treating neurologists successfully identified the medication condition for 82\u00b1 of participants receiving medication only; trial participants accurately identified their medication condition when receiving active medication (77\u00b1 of participants), but not when receiving placebo. Concurrent stress-management therapy reduced, but did not eliminate penetration of the blind. Irrespective of drug condition, when participants were improved they were judged to be on active medication and when unimproved they were judged to be on placebo. However, neurologists' ratings of improvement, participants' reports of improvement and daily headache recordings yielded equivalent outcomes. Penetration of the blind needs to be assessed, not assumed in clinical trials in headache. However, penetration of the blind did not produce a prodrug bias as has been asserted by critics. Better methods of assessing and quantifying blindness are needed.",

While the placebo response seems to be similar for women and men, gender differences were found for nocebo rates.

By using the tools of modern medicine, the physician today can treat and prevent a number of diseases through pharmacology, genetics, and physical interventions.

This review describes recent findings that give scientific evidence to the old tenet that patients must be both cured and cared for. In fact, we are today in a good position to investigate complex psychological factors, like placebo effects and the doctor-patient relationship, by using a physiological and neuroscientific approach. These intricate psychological factors can be approached through biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology, thus eliminating the old dichotomy between biology and psychology. This is both a biomedical and a philosophical enterprise that is changing the way we approach and interpret medicine and human biology. In the first case, curing the disease only is not sufficient, and care of the patient is of tantamount importance. In the second case, the philosophical debate about the mind-body interaction can find some important answers in the study of placebo effects. Therefore, maybe paradoxically, the placebo effect and the doctor-patient relationship can be approached by using the same biochemical, cellular and physiological tools of the materia medica, which represents an epochal transition from general concepts such as suggestibility and power of mind to a true physiology of the doctor-patient interaction.",

            "abstract": "Modern medicine has progressed in parallel with the advancement of biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology. By using the tools of modern medicine, the physician today can treat and prevent a number of diseases through pharmacology, genetics, and physical interventions. Besides this materia medica, the patient's mind, cognitions, and emotions play a central part as well in any therapeutic outcome, as investigated by disciplines such as psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology. This review describes recent findings that give scientific evidence to the old tenet that patients must be both cured and cared for. In fact, we are today in a good position to investigate complex psychological factors, like placebo effects and the doctor-patient relationship, by using a physiological and neuroscientific approach. These intricate psychological factors can be approached through biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology, thus eliminating the old dichotomy between biology and psychology. This is both a biomedical and a philosophical enterprise that is changing the way we approach and interpret medicine and human biology. In the first case, curing the disease only is not sufficient, and care of the patient is of tantamount importance. In the second case, the philosophical debate about the mind-body interaction can find some important answers in the study of placebo effects. Therefore, maybe paradoxically, the placebo effect and the doctor-patient relationship can be approached by using the same biochemical, cellular and physiological tools of the materia medica, which represents an epochal transition from general concepts such as suggestibility and power of mind to a true physiology of the doctor-patient interaction.",

Combined with current theory and evidence, it is suggested that core symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, social deficits) may be products of disturbed interoceptive-exteroceptive integration.

We then consider the implications of this approach for understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allostasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a \u2018locked in\u2019 brain that is relatively insensitive to its sensory context.

            "abstract": "Interoception is the sensing of internal bodily sensations. Interoception is an umbrella term that encompasses (1) the afferent (body\u2010to\u2010brain) signaling through distinct neural and humoral (including immune and endocrine) channels; (2) the neural encoding, representation, and integration of this information concerning internal bodily state; (3) the influence of such information on other perceptions, cognitions, and behaviors; (4) and the psychological expression of these representations as consciously accessible physical sensations and feelings. Interoceptive mechanisms ensure physiological health through the cerebral coordination of homeostatic reflexes and allostatic responses that include motivational behaviors and associated affective and emotional feelings. Furthermore, the conscious, unitary sense of self in time and space may be grounded in the primacy and lifelong continuity of interoception. Body\u2010to\u2010brain interactions influence physical and mental well\u2010being. Consequently, we show that systematic investigation of how individual differences, and within\u2010individual changes, in interoceptive processing can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of physical and psychological disorders. We present a neurobiological overview of interoception and describe how interoceptive impairments at different levels relate to specific physical and mental health conditions, including sickness behaviors and fatigue, depression, eating disorders, autism, and anxiety. We frame these findings in an interoceptive predictive processing framework and highlight potential new avenues for treatments.",

            "abstract": "Interoception is the sense of the physiological condition of the entire body. Impaired interoception has been associated with aberrant activity of the insula in major depressive disorder (MDD) during heartbeat perception tasks. Despite clinical relevance, studies investigating interoceptive impairments in MDD have never been reviewed systematically according to the guidelines of the PRISMA protocol, and therefore we collated studies that assessed accuracy in detecting heartbeat sensations (interoceptive accuracy, IAc) in MDD (databases: PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES). Out of 389 records, six studies met the inclusion criteria. The main findings suggest that (i) moderately depressed samples exhibit the largest interoceptive deficits as compared with healthy adults. (ii) difficulties in decision making and low affect intensity are correlated with low IAc, and (iii) IAc seems to normalize in severely depressed subjects. These associations may be confounded by sex, anxiety or panic disorder, and intake of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Our findings have implications for the development of interoceptive treatments that might relieve MDD-related symptoms or prevent relapse in recurrent depression by targeting the interoceptive nervous system.",

            "abstract": "Interoception is the sense of the physiological condition of the entire body. Impaired interoception has been associated with aberrant activity of the insula in major depressive disorder (MDD) during heartbeat perception tasks. Despite clinical relevance, studies investigating interoceptive impairments in MDD have never been reviewed systematically according to the guidelines of the PRISMA protocol, and therefore we collated studies that assessed accuracy in detecting heartbeat sensations (interoceptive accuracy, IAc) in MDD (databases: PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES). Out of 389 records, six studies met the inclusion criteria. The main findings suggest that (i) moderately depressed samples exhibit the largest interoceptive deficits as compared with healthy adults. (ii) difficulties in decision making and low affect intensity are correlated with low IAc, and (iii) IAc seems to normalize in severely depressed subjects. These associations may be confounded by sex, anxiety or panic disorder, and intake of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Our findings have implications for the development of interoceptive treatments that might relieve MDD-related symptoms or prevent relapse in recurrent depression by targeting the interoceptive nervous system.",

Abnormalities in self-reported interoception are prevalent features of major depressive disorder (MDD) and may affect treatment outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the psychometric properties of the revised eight-dimensional and 37-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (the MAIA-2) in a severely depressed sample, after translating two updated scales (Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying) into German. Specifically, we examined the measure\u2019s internal consistency reliability, sensitivity to change, and minimal important differences (MID) with a focus on patient\u2019s antidepressive responses to treatment. Methods The study enrolled 110 participants (age: M = 46.85, SD = 11.23; female: 55.45%) undergoing hospital treatment, of whom 87 were included in the pre-post analysis. Participants completed a German translation of MAIA-2 and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (pre-/post-treatment). Internal consistency reliability was determined by Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1/McDonalds\u2019s \u03c9, sensitivity to change was determined by effect sizes, and MIDs were determined by distribution- (0.5*SD) and anchor-based approaches (mean change method; ROC curve cut-points). Results Depression severity reduced over the course of treatment (Median = -65.22%), and 34.48% of patients achieved remission. Reliability was appropriate for post-treatment (range of \u03c9: .70-.90), but questionable for two pre-treatment scales (Noticing: \u03c9 = .64; Not-Distracting: \u03c9 = .66). The eight dimensions of MAIA-2 were sensitive to change (standardized response mean: .32-.81; Cohen\u2019s effect size: .30-.92). Distribution-based MIDs (.38-.61) and anchor-based mean change MIDs (remission vs. partial response: .00-.85; partial response vs. nonresponse: .08-.88) were established on the group level. For six scales, ROC cut-points (remission: .00\u20131.33; response: -.20\u20131.00) demonstrated accurate classification to treatment response groups on the individual level. Conclusions This study demonstrated the applicability of the MAIA-2 questionnaire in MDD. The updated version may have led to reliability improvements regarding the revised scales, but subthreshold reliability was evident prior to treatment. The measure\u2019s dimensions were sensitive to change. MIDs were established that corresponded with antidepressive treatment outcomes. Our findings are consistent with a growing area of research which considers somatic feelings as key contributors to mental health.",

            "abstract": "Background Previous research studies have demonstrated that impaired interoception is involved in emotional information processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). Heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes, an index for interoception, could be manipulated by emotional faces in healthy people. Considering negative emotional bias is the core characteristic in MDD, we hypothesized that interoception dysfunction was associated with the negative emotional bias in MDD. Methods An electroencephalogram (EEG) study under an emotional faces task was applied to explore the relationship between interoception and emotional bias. HEPs before emotional faces stimuli were used to predict the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes and it worked as an index of emotional bias. Twenty-seven patients with MDD and 27 healthy controls (HCs) participated in this study. Source analysis gave an auxiliary description for results in sensory level. Results Major depressive disorders (MDDs) had poor performance in the heartbeat count task (HCT) and attenuate HEP average amplitudes (455\u2013550 ms). Compared with HCs, cluster-based permutation t-tests revealed that MDDs had attenuated LPP amplitudes (300\u20131,000 ms) over centroparietal regions and enhanced LPP amplitudes over frontocentral regions. Furthermore, abnormal attenuated HEPs could predict aberrant LPPs under sad face stimuli in MDDs, which could be associated with the dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right insula. Conclusion Mediated by ACC and insula, interoception dysfunction contributes to the negative emotional bias of MDD, highlighting the importance of interoception in the disorder.",

            "abstract": "Background Previous research studies have demonstrated that impaired interoception is involved in emotional information processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). Heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes, an index for interoception, could be manipulated by emotional faces in healthy people. Considering negative emotional bias is the core characteristic in MDD, we hypothesized that interoception dysfunction was associated with the negative emotional bias in MDD.

HEPs before emotional faces stimuli were used to predict the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes and it worked as an index of emotional bias.

            "abstract": "Hypnotizability is a psychophysiological trait measured by scales and associated with several differences, including interoceptive accuracy and the morpho-functional characteristics of interoception-related brain regions. The aim of the study was to assess whether the amplitude of the heartbeat evoked cortical potential (HEP), a correlate of interoceptive accuracy, differs in participants with low (lows) and high (highs) hypnotizability scores (assessed by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form A) before and after the induction of hypnosis. ECG and EEG were monitored in 16 highs and 15 lows during an experimental session, including open eyes baseline (B), closed eyes relaxation (R), hypnotic induction (IND), neutral hypnosis (NH), and post session baseline (Post). No significant difference was observed between groups and conditions in autonomic variables. The HEP amplitude was lower in highs than in lows at the right parietal site, likely due to hypnotizability related differences in the functional connection between the right insula and parietal cortex. It increased in highs and decreased in lows across the session, possibly due to the highs' preeminently internally directed attention and to the lows' possible disengagement from the task. Since interoception is involved in several cognitive-emotional functions, its hypnotizability related differences may contribute to the variability of experience and behavior in daily life.",
