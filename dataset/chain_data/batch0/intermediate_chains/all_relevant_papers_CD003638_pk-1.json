        "abstract": "Painful diabetic neuropathy is just one of a myriad of secondary conditions that may result from poor glycaemic control. Educating the patient to suspect diabetic complications, understanding why they may occur, what their progression is likely to be and what measures can be taken to avoid them can significantly improve outcomes. Education within the diabetes management framework needs to be consistent, prioritised, tailored to the needs of each patient and ongoing in order to be maximally effective, with tight glycaemic control playing the anchoring central role. The specialist diabetes nurse is in the ideal situation to coordinate this education and to ensure that the patient with diabetes receives the care and support needed to take dual responsibility for their condition.

        "abstract": "Objective. To evaluate the cost savings and clinical effectiveness of a Cooperative Extension Service diabetes education program for improving nutrition knowledge, food portioning skills, hemoglobin A1c (A1C), and anthropometric indices.\n\nDesign. Clients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes enrolled in a 3-month diabetes education course focused on food portioning skills. Pre- and post-course anthropometric measurements, a written food portion test, an observational food portioning skill test, and an A1C test were administered and scored. Paired t tests were calculated between pre- and post-course scores to measure statistical significance.\n\nResults. Data analysis showed improvement in food portion knowledge written test scores (49.67% pre- and 59.56% post-course, P = 0.004), food portioning skills (out of a possible score of 5, 2.43 pre-, 4.29 post-course, P = 0.023), A1C results (7.16% pre-, 6.43% post-course, P = 0.000), body mass index (BMI) (32.60 kg/m2 pre-, 31.78 kg/m2 post-course, P = 0.000), weight (202.58 lb pre-, 199.74 lb post-course, P = 0.000), waist circumference (42.43 inches pre-, 41.16 inches post-course, P = 0.000), hip circumference (45.96 inches pre-, 45.36 inches post-course, P = 0.000), and waist-to-hip ratio (0.92 pre-, 0.91 post-course, P = 0.000).\n\nConclusions/Applications. Evaluation of the Utah State University Extension Service diabetes education program showed improved nutrition knowledge, anthropometric measures, and glucose control. These improvements have been estimated to reduce medical costs by $94,010.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPopulation-level strategies to organize and deliver care may improve diabetes management. We conducted a multiclinic controlled trial of population management in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe created diabetic patient registries (n = 3,079) for four primary care clinics within a single academic health center. In the intervention clinic (n = 898), a nurse practitioner used novel clinical software (PopMan) to identify patients on a weekly basis with outlying values for visit and testing intervals and last measured levels of HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure. For these patients, the nurse practitioner e-mailed a concise patient-specific summary of evidence-based management suggestions directly to primary care providers (PCPs). Population changes in risk factor testing, medication prescription, and risk factor levels from baseline (1 January 2000 to 31 August 2001) to follow-up (1 December 2001 to 31 July 2003) were compared with the three usual-care control clinics (n = 2,181).\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients had a mean age of 65 years, were mostly white (81%), and the majority were insured by Medicare/Medicaid (62%). From baseline to follow-up, the increase in proportion of patients tested for HbA1c (P = 0.004) and LDL cholesterol (P < 0.001) was greater in the intervention than control sites. Improvements in diabetes-related medication prescription and levels of HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure in the intervention clinic were balanced by similar improvements in the control sites.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPopulation-level clinical registries combined with summarized recommendations to PCPs had a modest effect on management. The intervention was limited by good overall quality of care at baseline and temporal improvements in all control clinics. It is unknown whether this intervention would have had greater impact in clinical settings with lower overall quality. Further research into more effective methods of translating population registry information into action is required.",
