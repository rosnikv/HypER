Recent evidence indicates that prompt pharmacological treatment and evaluation may help mitigate this risk. Objective: To identify risk factors for recurrent stroke 1 week after index cerebrovascular event and review evidence for early and aggressive evaluation and management. Methods: We searched the National Library of Medicine Pubmed database to identify studies reporting recurrent or secondary stroke in individuals with identified stroke or TIA. Results/conclusion: The risk of recurrent stroke in the week after a TIA or minor stroke is up to 10%. Factors identified with risk of early stroke recurrence include age, elevated blood pressure, clinical symptoms of motor weakness or speech disturbance, and large vessel atherothrombotic mechanism. Studies have shown that timely initiation of stroke preventative therapy may reduce the risk of stroke within this early period.",

        "abstract": "A medical emergency is a condition that requires immediate action to prevent severe disability or death. Despite the apparent well-being of the patient after the ictus, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is an emergency. Transient ischemic attack has long been known as a precursortomajorischaemicstroke.Inarecentmeta-analysis,the risk of stroke after TIA was estimated to be 31%, 64% and 87% at 2 days, 1 month and 3 months, respectively. In the same review, using only data from studies using active outcome ascertainment, the risk was estimated at 99%, 134% and 173% for the same time points (1). Half of the 90-day stroke risk occurs in the first 2 days after TIA, and 76% of strokes required hospitalization (2). The FASTER trial provided the first prospective evaluation of early risk of stroke after TIA in a randomized trial, enrolling patients within 24 h of symptom onset. In this selected population of minor stroke or TIA patients with weakness or speech disturbance for more than five minutes as part of their clinical event, the 90-day risk of stroke was 89% across treatment groups and the median time to the event was only 1 day (3). Thus, TIA portends a serious risk of early major stroke and the time window for intervention is short. Immediately after the resolution of neurological deficits, a patient has the whole high risk period before him. For patients with rapidly improving or fully resolved deficits, several reports indicate a high risk of deterioration and permanent deficits, especially for patients with a marked initial improvementon theNationalInstitute ofHealthStrokeScale(NIHSS) (4). Indeed, as a general rule, the risk of stroke and new neurologicaldeficitsishigherinpatientswithTIAthanamong patients with completed stroke, indicating an unstable ongoing process. In parallel, the long-term prognosis after TIA is grave. The combined risk of stroke, MI or death in the first year after TIA has been estimated at 22%, with the composite outcome primarily driven by the high stroke rate (5). A meta-analysis estimated a similar 22% annual rate of MI and a 21% annual rate of non-stroke vascular death after TIA (6). The concept of TIA has evolved, and a new definition has been proposed (7).

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 The risk of a recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke is high. Clinical trials are needed to assess acute treatment options in these patients. We sought to evaluate the type of recurrent events and to identify which subsets of patients are at risk for recurrent events. Methods\u2014 One hundred and eighty patients with TIA or minor stroke were examined within 12 hours and underwent brain MRI within 24 hours. Any neurological deterioration was recorded, and a combination of clinical and MRI factors were used to create a combined event classification. Subgroups of patients analyzed included classical TIA, patients with NIHSS=0, and patients with NIHSS >0 in ED. Results\u2014 Overall there were 38 events in 36 patients (20% event rate); 20 were symptomatic and 18 were silent (only evident because of the follow up MRI). 18/20 (90%) symptomatic events were associated with progression of presenting symptoms, compared to 2/20 (10%) with a clear recurrent stroke distinct from the original event. We found a low risk of recurrent stroke among classical definition TIA patients (1.1%). Patients with an NIHSS=0 in the ED, had an intermediate event rate (6.6%) between TIA (classical \u2013 1.1%) and NIHSS >0 (14.4%; &khgr;2 test for trend, P=0.02). All clinical categories of patient (TIA, stroke, NIHSS=0) accumulated silent lesions on MRI. Conclusions\u2014 Most events were classified as stroke progression or infarct growth rather than a recurrent stroke. A low risk of recurrence was found in patients with classical TIA and those with no neurological deficits on initial assessment.",

        "abstract": "Background Risk of a subsequent stroke following an acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke is high. The ABCD2 tool was proposed as a method to triage these patients using five clinical factors. Modern imaging of the brain was not included. The present study quantified the added value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors to the ABCD2 tool. Methods Patients with TIA or minor stroke were examined within 12 h and had a brain MRI within 24 h of symptom onset. Primary outcomes were recurrent stroke and functional impairment at 90 days. A new tool, ABCD2+ MRI, was created by adding diffusion-weighted imaging lesion and vessel occlusion status to the ABCD2 tool. The predictive accuracy of both tools was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Results One hundred and eighty patients were enrolled and 11\u00b71% had a recurrent stroke within 90 days. The predictive accuracy of the ABCD2+MRI was significantly higher than ABCD2 (AUC of 0\u00b788 vs. 0\u00b778, P = 0\u00b701). Those with a high score (7\u20139) had a 90-day recurrent stroke risk of 32\u00b71%, moderate score (5\u20136) risk of 5\u00b74%, and low score (0-4) risk of 0\u00b70%. The ABCD2 tool did not predict risk of functional impairment at 90 days (P = 0\u00b733), unlike the ABCD2+MRI (P = 0\u00b702): high score (22\u00b79%), moderate (7\u00b75%), low (7\u00b77%). Conclusions Risk of recurrent stroke and functional impairment after a TIA or minor stroke can be accurately predicted by a scoring system that utilizes both clinical and MRI information. The ABCD2+MRI score is simple and its components are commonly available during the time of admission.",

        "abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether progression or fluctuation of transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms is a predictor of subsequent stroke. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 113 consecutive patients admitted with a diagnosis of classical TIA with symptom duration of less than 24 h. We assessed the background characteristics, TIA symptoms, attack characteristics, results of in-hospital examinations, and prescription of antithrombotic agents on discharge for each patient. We then analyzed the factors related to progression or fluctuation of TIA symptoms. Results: Of the 113 patients, 35 (31.0%) exhibited symptom progression or fluctuation. Subsequent stroke occurred in 12 (10.6%) patients within 180 days. Symptom progression or fluctuation was significantly related to the TIA symptoms of speech disturbance, hemiparesis, and monoparesis, and were also related to subsequent stroke occurrence within 90 days (29 vs. 3%, p = 0.004) and 180 days (23 vs. 5%, p = 0.008). In a logistic regression model analysis, symptom progression or fluctuation was a significant predictor of subsequent stroke within 90 days (odds ratio = 7.65, 95% CI 1.27\u201346.06) and 180 days (odds ratio = 4.44, 95% CI 1.08\u201318.13), independently of other predictors demonstrated in previous studies. Conclusions: Progression or fluctuation of TIA symptoms may be an important predictor of subsequent stroke. A detailed interview about the characteristics of each attack is also indispensable for the provision of appropriate care to TIA patients.",

        "title": "Statin use before and after acute ischemic stroke onset improves neurological outcome",
        "abstract": "The devastating consequences of stroke, both in terms of morbidity and mortality, and the economic implications it has worldwide, coupled with a growing knowledge regarding its pathophysiology, has led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in recent years that have had an enormous impact on clinical practice and the outcome of stroke patients. While thrombolysis is regarded as the most important of these developments, its relatively narrow therapeutic window and complexity of administration imply that only a minority of stroke patients can benefit from it. Among other strategies, in an attempt to overcome this limitation, research has focused on the development of neuroprotection aimed to salvage ischemic brain tissue by means complementary to reperfusion. Among these approaches, the use of statins stands out, which, by inhibiting the HMG CoA reductase, interfere with the formation of isoprenoid intermediates in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and have been shown to have a positive impact in both the incidence and outcome of acute stroke. The main results of animal models, observational studies, clinical trials and opinion articles available in the medical literature covering the effect of statins on acute brain ischemia will be reviewed in order to provide in-depth information regarding their mode of action and current evidence regarding their potential benefits for ischemic stroke patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (\u2018statins\u2019) reduce the neuronal injury in dose-dependent fashion in rodent stroke models. We sought to determine whether lovastatin at doses above those currently approved can be administered safely within 24 h after an acute ischemic stroke. Methods: We conducted a phase 1B dose-finding study using an adaptive design novel to stroke trials, the continual reassessment method, to find the highest tolerated dose of lovastatin. Planned doses were 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days. The primary safety outcomes were myotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The model was calibrated to select a dose causing 7\u201313% toxicity. Results: We enrolled 33 patients (16 men/17 women, age range 23\u201382 years). Three patients were treated at 1 mg/kg, 10 at 3 mg/kg, 12 at 6 mg/kg, and 8 at 8 mg/kg. Thirty of the 33 patients (90.9%) completed at least 11 of 12 doses. Two patients at the 6-mg/kg dose level experienced transient mild elevations in transaminases without clinical sequelae. After an initial dose reduction, the dose was re-escalated to 8 mg/kg, and no further patients reached safety outcomes. No clinical liver disease, myopathy, or creatine phosphokinase elevations occurred. The final model-based toxicity at 8 mg/kg was 13%; no patient was treated at 10 mg/kg. Conclusions: Lovastatin at doses above those currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration is feasible for 3 days after an acute ischemic stroke and the maximum tolerated dose is estimated to be 8 mg/kg/day. Further randomized studies are warranted to confirm its safety and to demonstrate its efficacy in improving functional outcomes after stroke.",

        "title": "The Acute (Cerebro)Vascular Effects of Statins",
        "abstract": "The introduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, i.e., statins, constitutes a milestone in the prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. The effects of statins extend far beyond their effects on cholesterol levels: pleiotropic effects include vasoprotective mechanisms, comprising improved endothelial function, increased bioavailability of nitric oxide, immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as antioxidant and stem cell-regulating capacities. Large clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that statins reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Recent experimental and clinical data have demonstrated that in addition to risk reduction, statins may also improve outcome after stroke and myocardial infarction, even when statins were administered after the event. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of statin therapy after acute cardio- or cerebrovascular events may impair vascular function and increase morbidity and mortality. Beyond stroke, statin treatment also has been shown to provide protective effects in critically ill patients, e.g., after major surgery, sepsis, or in patients at high-vascular risk. However, although large randomized controlled trials are missing, ongoing trials will clarify the impact of acute statin treatment in these conditions. Although evidence is presently limited, acute statin therapy is emerging as a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of the critically ill. Until now, statins were only available as oral drugs. An IV formulation may be warranted for acute treatment of severely ill patients, for example, those who are unable to swallow or scheduled for surgery. Hydrophilic statins would be suitable for an IV formulation and have been safely tested in healthy volunteers.",

We have reviewed recent evidence on the burden of TIA and prediction and prevention of stroke in the acute phase. Recent findingsAlthough recent data on the incidence and prevalence of TIA are lacking, available data suggest that the burden of TIA is higher than previously estimated and may be expected to increase with the ageing of the population. Prospective prognostic studies have shown that the early risk of stroke after TIA is approximately 5% at 7 days and 10\u201315% at 90 days depending on clinical settings and study methodology. This risk can be reliably predicted by risk scores based on clinical features (the ABCD system), TIA aetiology and findings on brain imaging, although the optimal combined prognostic strategy is uncertain because the interaction between individual predictors is not established. Studies of the urgent assessment and initiation of secondary prevention in specialist centres suggest that the early risk of stroke after TIA can be reduced by up to 80%.
