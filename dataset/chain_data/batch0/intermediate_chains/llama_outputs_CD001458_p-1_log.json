            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCollaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain.

Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCollaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.\n\n\nSTUDIES REVIEWED\n287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\"Serious vascular event\": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.",

Methods: We identified prospective studies of patients with IS or TIA that investigated CMBs and stroke (ICH and IS) risk during \u22653 months follow-up. Authors provided aggregate summary-level data on stroke outcomes, with CMBs categorized according to burden (single, 2\u20134, and \u22655 CMBs) and distribution. We calculated absolute event rates and pooled risk ratios (RR) using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 5,068 patients from 15 studies. There were 115/1,284 (9.6%) recurrent IS events in patients with CMBs vs 212/3,781 (5.6%) in patients without CMBs (pooled RR 1.8 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4\u20132.5). There were 49/1,142 (4.3%) ICH events in those with CMBs vs 17/2,912 (0.58%) in those without CMBs (pooled RR 6.3 for CMBs vs no CMBs; 95% CI 3.5\u201311.4). Increasing CMB burden increased the risk of IS (pooled RR [95% CI] 1.8 [1.0\u20133.1], 2.4 [1.3\u20134.4], and 2.7 [1.5\u20134.9] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively) and ICH (pooled RR [95% CI] 4.6 [1.9\u201310.7], 5.6 [2.4\u201313.3], and 14.1 [6.9\u201329.0] for 1 CMB, 2\u20134 CMBs, and \u22655 CMBs, respectively).

Background and Purpose\u2014 We aimed to determine the safety and mortality after mechanical thrombectomy in patients taking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Methods\u2014 In a multicenter observational cohort study, we used multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate associations of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) with VKA or DOAC prescription before thrombectomy as compared with no anticoagulation. The primary outcomes were the rate of sICH and all-cause mortality at 90 days, incorporating sensitivity analysis regarding confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation. Additionally, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature on this topic. Results\u2014 Altogether, 1932 patients were included (VKA, n=222; DOAC, n=98; no anticoagulation, n=1612); median age, 74 years (interquartile range, 62\u201382); 49.6% women. VKA prescription was associated with increased odds for sICH and mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.55 [95% CI, 1.35\u20134.84] and 1.64 [95% CI, 1.09\u20132.47]) as compared with the control group, whereas no association with DOAC intake was observed (aOR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.29\u20133.35] and 1.35 [95% CI, 0.72\u20132.53]). Sensitivity analyses considering only patients within the confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation range did not alter the findings. A study-level meta-analysis incorporating data from 7462 patients (855 VKAs, 318 DOACs, and 6289 controls) from 15 observational cohorts corroborated these observations, yielding an increased rate of sICH in VKA patients (aOR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.22\u20132.17]) but not in DOAC patients (aOR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.60\u20131.80]). Conclusions\u2014 Patients taking VKA have an increased risk of sICH and mortality after mechanical thrombectomy. The lower risk of sICH associated with DOAC may also be noticeable in the acute setting. Improved selection might be advisable in VKA-treated patients.

            "abstract": "Aim: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are over-represented in endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) populations, due to a high prevalence of large vessel occlusions (LVO) and contraindication to intravenous thrombolysis. This study aimed to: (1) compare 90-day functional outcomes [modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2] and mortality in AF vs. non-AF patients receiving EVT; (2) compare 90-day functional outcomes and mortality in AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation receiving EVT; and (3) identify factors influencing outcomes in AF patients receiving EVT. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 394 consecutive patients who received EVT for anterior cerebral circulation LVO at an Australian comprehensive stroke center was performed. The main outcome measures [90-day dichotomized mRS (0-2 good; 3-6 poor functional outcome) and mortality] were compared between AF and nonAF patients, as well as between therapeutic and non-therapeutic anticoagulation cohorts. Page 2 of Fu et al. Vessel Plus 2021;5:33 https://dx.doi.org/10.20517/2574-1209.2021.36 11 Results: In total, 171 (49%) EVT patients had AF. Patients with AF were older, had higher NIHSS, and had lower rates of thrombolysis administration. AF patients showed improved 90-day mRS on multivariate analysis [aOR 1.988 (1.167-3.387)], with similar symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) [aOR 0.364 (0.064-2.086)] and mortality [aOR 1.454 (0.785-2.696)]. There was no difference in 90-day mRS [aOR 1.402 (0.625-3.145)], successful reperfusion rates [aOR 3.761 (0.661-21.410)], or mortality [aOR 1.077 (0.429-2.705)] between AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation. In patients with AF, advancing age and higher NIHSS were independent predictors of worse 90-day functional outcome (OR = 1.045, P = 0.020; OR = 1.086, P = 0.001) and mortality (OR = 1.138, P < 0.001; OR = 1.107, P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, thrombolysis administration improved mortality (OR = 0.215, P = 0.016) but not functional outcomes. Conclusion: Patients with AF showed improved 90-day functional outcome, with similar mortality and sICH, after EVT. Therapeutic anticoagulation did not adversely influence EVT outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Aim: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are over-represented in endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) populations, due to a high prevalence of large vessel occlusions (LVO) and contraindication to intravenous thrombolysis. This study aimed to: (1) compare 90-day functional outcomes [modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2] and mortality in AF vs. non-AF patients receiving EVT; (2) compare 90-day functional outcomes and mortality in AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation receiving EVT; and (3) identify factors influencing outcomes in AF patients receiving EVT. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 394 consecutive patients who received EVT for anterior cerebral circulation LVO at an Australian comprehensive stroke center was performed. The main outcome measures [90-day dichotomized mRS (0-2 good; 3-6 poor functional outcome) and mortality] were compared between AF and nonAF patients, as well as between therapeutic and non-therapeutic anticoagulation cohorts. Page 2 of Fu et al. Vessel Plus 2021;5:33 https://dx.doi.org/10.20517/2574-1209.2021.36 11 Results: In total, 171 (49%) EVT patients had AF. Patients with AF were older, had higher NIHSS, and had lower rates of thrombolysis administration. AF patients showed improved 90-day mRS on multivariate analysis [aOR 1.988 (1.167-3.387)], with similar symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) [aOR 0.364 (0.064-2.086)] and mortality [aOR 1.454 (0.785-2.696)]. There was no difference in 90-day mRS [aOR 1.402 (0.625-3.145)], successful reperfusion rates [aOR 3.761 (0.661-21.410)], or mortality [aOR 1.077 (0.429-2.705)] between AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation. In patients with AF, advancing age and higher NIHSS were independent predictors of worse 90-day functional outcome (OR = 1.045, P = 0.020; OR = 1.086, P = 0.001) and mortality (OR = 1.138, P < 0.001; OR = 1.107, P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, thrombolysis administration improved mortality (OR = 0.215, P = 0.016) but not functional outcomes. Conclusion: Patients with AF showed improved 90-day functional outcome, with similar mortality and sICH, after EVT. Therapeutic anticoagulation did not adversely influence EVT outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Background Where stroke occurs with pre-existing atrial fibrillation (AF)studies validating the safety and efficacy of bridging thrombolysis, and the use of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in the setting of prior anticoagulation, are limited to single-center reports. Methods In a retrospective analysis, AF patients undergoing EVT for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke enrolled in a prospectively-maintained, international multicenter database (International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE)) between 2016 and 2019 were studied. Patients were categorized by anticoagulation status: anticoagulated (warfarin/non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants) versus not anticoagulated. Patients not anticoagulated were further divided into intravenous thrombolysis versus no thrombolysis. Outcomes compared between groups included 90-day modified Rankin Scale, 90-day mortality, rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and good reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b-3). Results Of 563 AF patients, 118 (21%) were on anticoagulation. AF patients on anticoagulation showed improved 90-day functional outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (95%\u2009CI) 1.00 to 2.82). Mortality (26.3% vs 23.8%), sICH (4.5% vs 3.9%), and rates of good reperfusion (91.3% vs 88.0%) were similar between those anticoagulated and those not anticoagulated. Thrombolysis before EVT in AF patients was independently associated with improved 90-day functional outcomes (aOR 1.81, 95%\u2009CI 1.18 to 2.79) and reduced mortality (aOR 0.51, 95%\u2009CI 0.31 to 0.84), with similar sICH rates (3.4% vs 4.5%). Conclusions Anticoagulated patients with AF who underwent EVT had improved 90-day functional outcomes and similar sICH rates. Thrombolysis before EVT in AF patients was associated with improved 90-day functional outcomes and reduced mortality.",
