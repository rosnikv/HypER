        "explanation": "This paper explores the long-term effects of Tai-Chi Chuan on cardiorespiratory function in older individuals. While it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it investigates a different aspect of Tai-Chi Chuan's benefits, which is inspired by the source paper's conclusion that Tai-Chi Chuan may serve as an alternative for exercise therapy and part of the rehabilitation program for RA patients."
