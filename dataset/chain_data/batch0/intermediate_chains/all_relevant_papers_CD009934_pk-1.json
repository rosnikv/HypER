        "title": "Mechanisms for food polyphenols to ameliorate insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction: therapeutic implications for diabetes and its cardiovascular complications.",
        "abstract": "The rising epidemic of diabetes is a pressing issue in clinical medicine worldwide from both healthcare and economic perspectives. This is fueled by overwhelming increases in the incidence and prevalence of obesity. Obesity and diabetes are characterized by both insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction that lead to substantial increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Reciprocal relationships between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction tightly link metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes with their cardiovascular complications. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that target either insulin resistance or endothelial dysfunction alone are likely to simultaneously improve both metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiology and disease outcomes. Moreover, combination therapies with agents targeting distinct mechanisms are likely to have additive or synergistic benefits. Conventional therapies for diabetes and its cardiovascular complications that are both safe and effective are insufficient to meet rising demand. Large, robust, epidemiologic studies demonstrate beneficial metabolic and cardiovascular health effects for many functional foods containing various polyphenols. However, precise molecular mechanisms of action for food polyphenols are largely unknown. Moreover, translation of these insights into effective clinical therapies has not been fully realized. Nevertheless, some functional foods are likely sources for safe and effective therapies and preventative strategies for metabolic diseases and their cardiovascular complications. In this review, we emphasize recent progress in elucidating molecular, cellular, and physiological actions of polyphenols from green tea (EGCG), cocoa (ECG), and citrus fruits (hesperedin) that are related to improving metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiology. We also discuss a rigorous comprehensive approach to studying functional foods that is essential for developing novel, effective, and safe medications derived from functional foods that will complement existing conventional drugs.",

        "title": "Green and black tea for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is increasing evidence that both green and black tea are beneficial for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the effects of green and black tea on the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following databases on 12 October 2012 without language restrictions: CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID) and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters). We also searched trial registers, screened reference lists and contacted authors for additional information where necessary.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials investigated the intake of green tea, black tea or tea extracts. The comparison group was no intervention, placebo or minimal intervention. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors. Any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions or focusing on weight loss were excluded to avoid confounding.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Trials of green tea were analysed separately from trials of black tea.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 11 RCTs with a total of 821 participants, two trials awaiting classification and one ongoing trial. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. Dosage and form of both green and black tea differed between trials. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules.No studies reported cardiovascular events.Black tea was found to produce statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.43 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.31) and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP): MD -1.85 mmHg, 95% CI -3.21 to -0.48. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): MD -1.27 mmHg, 95% CI -3.06 to 0.53) over six months, stable to sensitivity analysis, but only a small number of trials contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias.Green tea was also found to produce statistically significant reductions in total cholesterol (MD -0.62 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.46), LDL cholesterol (MD -0.64 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.52) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -3.18 mmHg, 95% CI -5.25 to -1.11; DBP: MD -3.42, 95% CI -4.54 to -2.30), but only a small number of studies contributed to each analysis, and results were not stable to sensitivity analysis. When both tea types were analysed together they showed favourable effects on LDL cholesterol (MD -0.48 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.35) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -2.25 mmHg, 95% CI -3.39 to -1.11; DBP: MD -2.81 mmHg, 95% CI -3.77 to -1.86). Adverse events were measured in five trials and included a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalisation for influenza, appendicitis and retinal detachment but these are unlikely to be directly attributable to the intervention.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere are very few long-term studies to date examining green or black tea for the primary prevention of CVD. The limited evidence suggests that tea has favourable effects on CVD risk factors, but due to the small number of trials contributing to each analysis the results should be treated with some caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm this.",

        "abstract": "Elevated postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress increase the risks of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Green tea catechin possesses antidiabetic properties and antioxidant capacity. In the present study, we examined the acute and continuous effects of ingestion of catechin-rich green tea on postprandial hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in healthy postmenopausal women. Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92\u00a0mg/350\u00a0ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3\u00a0h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0\u00a0h) and at 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3\u00a0% lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P<\u00a00\u00b705), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed. Conversely, serum postprandial thioredoxin concentrations were 5\u00a0% higher in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction, P<\u00a00\u00b705). These findings indicate that an acute ingestion of catechin-rich green tea has beneficial effects on postprandial glucose and redox homeostasis in postmenopausal women.",

        "title": "Low dose of green tea catechins improves endothelial function and vascular smooth muscle cell reactivity in obese women",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of obesity in the world is associated with several health problems, with endothelial dysfunction figuring as a frequent feature. We investigated whether low dose consumption of green tea extract (catechins,< 200 mg/day) could modify endothelial function, lipid profile, fasting glucose and insulin, post load plasma glucose, inflammatory/oxidative stress biomarkers and blood pressure in obese women. METHODS: Sixteen obese women with body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 Kg/m2, mean age 38 [33-40] years, consumed 600 ml green tea (3 \u00d7 200 ml) per day, containing 153.3 mg of catechins and 72.5 mg of caffeine, during three months. Endothelial function was evaluated through venous occlusion plethysmography by increment of peak forearm blood flow (FBF), after 5 min ischemia, during the reactive hyperemia response/baseline FBF. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was analyzed through peak FBF after 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin/baseline FBF. RESULTS: After 3 months, this consumption of green tea reduced BMI from 34.02 to 33.13, and diastolic blood pressure by 4 mmHg. The reactive hyperemia response/baseline FBF improved by 27%, and the endothelium-independent vasodilation by 12%. The blood biochemical profile, where all parameters were within the normal range, remained unaltered. CONCLUSIONS: A low dose of green tea ameliorated the endothelial dysfunction present in obesity, indicating that its consumption should be encouraged in these patients, because endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of atherosclerosis.",

        "title": "Vascular and Metabolic Actions of the Green Tea Polyphenol Epigallocatechin Gallate",
        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies demonstrate robust correlations between green tea consumption and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. However, underlying molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Health promoting actions of green tea are often attributed to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green tea. Insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction play key roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. Metabolic insulin resistance results from impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and blunted insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output that is often associated with endothelial/vascular dysfunction. This endothelial dysfunction is itself caused, in part, by impaired insulin signaling in vascular endothelium resulting in reduced insulin-stimulated production of NO in arteries, and arterioles that regulate nutritive capillaries. In this review, we discuss the considerable body of literature supporting insulin-mimetic actions of EGCG that oppose endothelial dysfunction and ameliorate metabolic insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver. We conclude that EGCG is a promising therapeutic to combat cardiovascular complications associated with the metabolic diseases characterized by reciprocal relationships between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction that include obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. There is a strong rationale for well-powered randomized placebo controlled intervention trials to be carried out in insulin resistant and diabetic populations.",

        "abstract": "Background: Sarcopenia, is a major concern for our aged society because sarcopenia is a fundamental cause of frailty and functional disability. \nAim: The effects of catechin-ingestionp and/or heat treatment on the volume in quadriceps muscles, isometric force of knee extension, and serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were investigated in healthy elderly women. \nMethods: Subjects (71.0 \u00b1 0.7 years old, n=27) were divided into 3 groups; 1) catechin-ingested, 2) heatstressed, and 3) catechin-ingestion with heat stressed (catechin+heat) groups. Subjects in both catechin-ingested and catechin+heat groups daily ingested 350 ml of green tea containing 540 mg of catechin in one hour for 10 weeks. Heat stress was applied on the quadriceps muscles for 8 hours a day and 4 days a week by using two heat- and steam generating sheets. \nResults: In catechin+heat group, muscle volume (Pre: 670 \u00b1 38.7 cm2, Post: 676 \u00b1 37.2 cm2) and maximal isometric force (Pre: 25.8 \u00b1 2.5 kg, Post: 27.0 \u00b1 2.5 kg) were significantly increased by the 10-week of treatment (p<0.05), but not in catechin-ingested and heat-stressed groups. The time of Timed-Get-Up-and-Go test (TUG), which is widely used to measure sit-to-stand performance, in both catechin-ingested (Pre: 6.70 \u00b1 0.33 s and Post: 6.19 \u00b1 0.28 s) and catechin+heat (Pre: 6.49 \u00b1 0.30 s and Post: 5.95 \u00b1 0.24 s) groups in catechin-ingested group; was significantly shortened by the treatment (p<0.05). Following 10-week of the treatment, serum TBARS levels in both catechin ingested (Pre: 29.06 \u00b1 1.32 nmol/ml, Post: 24.47 \u00b1 2.30 nmol/ml) and catechin+heat (Pre: 29.84 \u00b1 1.57 nmol/ml, Post: 23.92 \u00b1 0.98 nmol/ml) groups were significantly decreased (p<0.05), but not in heat group. \nConclusions: Evidences suggest that catechin-ingestion with heat stress might improve impaired muscle function of elderly women.",
