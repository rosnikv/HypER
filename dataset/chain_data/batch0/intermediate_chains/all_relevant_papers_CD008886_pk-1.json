        "title": "Additive clinical effect of indomethacin suppositories during salicylate therapy in rheumatoid patients.",
        "abstract": "Twelve rheumatic patients were given 2.0 and 4.5 g acetylsalicylic acid daily in two 3-week periods. On days 13 and 20 of each period the patients took a suppository containing either placebo or 50 mg of indomethacin. The study was performed double-blind. Indomethacin had a significant additive effect during ASA therapy with 2 g daily as estimated by articular index and subjective ratings of pain and morning stiffness. On the 4.5 g ASA dose there was a significant improvement only for articular index. The patients experienced less pain during maintenance therapy with 4.5 g of ASA compared with 2.0 g daily. Both ASA doses induced complete inhibition of prostaglandin PGF2 alpha release from platelets. Thus the suppression of PGF2 alpha release does not reflect the therapeutic response of these drugs. Side effects observed comprised tinnitus, dizziness and gastritis. In 2 of the patients the aminotransferase levels increased, indicating hepatotoxicity. The protein binding of salicylate decreased with increasing salicylate concentration. As the dose was increased from 2.0 to 4.5 g/day the unbound concentration increased 5 to 24 times. This reflects the combined effect of capacity-limited metabolism and capacity-limited protein binding of salicylate.",

        "explanation": "The key hypothesis in this paper is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it investigates the additive effect of another NSAID (indomethacin) during salicylate therapy, building upon the source paper's results regarding the interaction between aspirin and ibuprofen."

        "title": "Combination Use of Nonsteroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs",
        "abstract": "Polypharmacy with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is widely practiced despite being condemned by many rheumatologists. Combination use of aspirin with other NSAIDs might be discouraged for three well-documented reasons. First, aspirin reduces the blood levels of many NSAIDs. Second, multiple drugs are antagonistic or at least less than additive in animal models of inflammation. Third, there is no good clinical data to suggest that combination use of NSAIDs is beneficial. Unless new studies become available, NSAIDs should be used one at a time, with supplementary analgesics added on a prn basis.",

        "title": "Clinical therapeutic trial of aspirin and azapropazone in rheumatoid arthritis when prescribed singly and in combination.",
        "abstract": "A double-blind, crossover trial was carried out to assess the clinical efficacy of 3.6 g aspirin, 1200 mg azapropazone and the two drugs together in 24 adult patients with classical or definite rheumatoid disease. Pain score, morning stiffness and patients' assessment of pain were significantly improved for each drug regimen when compared to placebo. There was no significant difference among the individual drug regimens. Azapropazone was the best drug regimen in terms of improving pain score, morning stiffness and patient assessment of pain, but this was not statistically significant. It is concluded that there is no justification for prescribing aspirin with azapropazone in patients with rheumatoid disease.",
