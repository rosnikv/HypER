            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low dose dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in glucocorticoid treated female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Forty one women ( \u2265 5 mg prednisolone/day) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study for 6 months where DHEA was given at 30 mg/20 mg ( \u2264 45/ \u2265 46 years) daily, or placebo, followed by 6 months open DHEA treatment to all patients. HRQOL was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, using four validated questionnaires and the patients' partners completed a questionnaire assessing mood and behaviour at 6 months. DHEA treatment increased serum levels of sulphated DHEA from subnormal to normal. The DHEA group improved in SF-36 \u201crole emotional\u201d and HSCL-56 total score (both p < 0.05). During open DHEA treatment, the former placebo group improved in SF-36 \u201cmental health\u201d (p < 0.05) with a tendency for improvement in HSCL-56 total score (p = 0.10). Both groups improved in McCoy's Sex Scale during active treatment (p < 0.05). DHEA replacement decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and haematocrit. There were no effects on bone density or disease activity and no serious adverse events. Side effects were mild. We conclude that low dose DHEA treatment improves HRQOL with regard to mental well-being and sexuality and can be offered to women with SLE where mental distress and/or impaired sexuality constitutes a problem.",

            "abstract": "With improvements in mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the functional status of these patients, assessed using health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments, is increasingly being recognised as an important outcome measure in clinical research. Domains of HRQoL of particular importance to SLE patients include fatigue, ability to work, good health, independence, social and family life, learned helplessness (reflecting the unpredictability of lupus), pain and the home environment. The SF-36 currently appears to be the best available generic instrument for the assessment of HRQoL in SLE, and is likely to be complemented by several newly-developed disease-specific HRQoL instruments. It has been shown that SLE patients have poorer functional status than the general population, and that specific manifestations of SLE (disease activity, previous renal involvement and fibromyalgia) may influence HRQoL. HRQoL in SLE patients has been improved by (1) psycho-educational interventions including telephone counselling, a self-help course, group psychotherapy; (2) therapies including Riquent, belimumab, mycophenolate mofetil, dehydroepiandrosterone, oestrogen therapy and a cholesterol- lowering diet. Additional research is needed to identify strategies which can improve HRQoL in SLE patients.",

The Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment (SELENA) version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) SLE disease activity instruments, the Short Form 36 health survey, and biomarker analyses were used to create a novel SRI. Response to treatment in a subset of 321 serologically active SLE patients (antinuclear antibodies >/=1:80 and/or anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies >/=30 IU/ml) at baseline was retrospectively evaluated using the SRI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSRI response is defined as 1) a >/=4-point reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI score, 2) no new BILAG A or no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score, and 3) no deterioration from baseline in the physician's global assessment by >/=0.3 points. In serologically active patients, the addition of belimumab to SOC resulted in a response in 46% of patients at week 52 compared with 29% of the placebo patients (P = 0.006).

The primary efficacy end point was the SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 (an SRI response was defined as a \u22654-point reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] A organ domain score and no more than 1 new BILAG B score, and no worsening in physician's global assessment score versus baseline).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBelimumab at 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy met the primary efficacy end point, generating a significantly greater SRI response at week 52 compared with placebo (43.2% versus 33.5%; P = 0.017). The rate with 1 mg/kg belimumab was 40.6% (P = 0.089). Response rates at week 76 were 32.4%, 39.1%, and 38.5% with placebo, 1 mg/kg belimumab, and 10 mg/kg belimumab, respectively. In post hoc sensitivity analyses evaluating higher SELENA-SLEDAI score thresholds, 10 mg/kg belimumab achieved better discrimination at weeks 52 and 76. Risk of severe flares over 76 weeks (based on the modified SLE Flare Index) was reduced with 1 mg/kg belimumab (34%) (P = 0.023) and 10 mg/kg belimumab (23%) (P = 0.13).

Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75\u2005mg or atacicept 150\u2005mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4\u2005weeks, then weekly for 48\u2005weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively. Results Enrolment in the atacicept 150\u2005mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75\u2005mg and placebo. Analysis of patients treated with atacicept 150\u2005mg suggested beneficial effect versus placebo in flare rates (OR: 0.48, p=0.002) and time to first flare (HR: 0.56, p=0.009). Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. Conclusions There was no difference between atacicept 75\u2005mg and placebo for flare rate or time to first flare. Analysis of atacicept 150\u2005mg suggested benefit.

Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75\u2005mg or atacicept 150\u2005mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4\u2005weeks, then weekly for 48\u2005weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively. Results Enrolment in the atacicept 150\u2005mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75\u2005mg and placebo.

Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate.

            "abstract": "Objectives Despite advances in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment, many patients suffer from the disease and side effects. Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75\u2005mg or atacicept 150\u2005mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4\u2005weeks, then weekly for 48\u2005weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively. Results Enrolment in the atacicept 150\u2005mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75\u2005mg and placebo. Analysis of patients treated with atacicept 150\u2005mg suggested beneficial effect versus placebo in flare rates (OR: 0.48, p=0.002) and time to first flare (HR: 0.56, p=0.009). Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. Conclusions There was no difference between atacicept 75\u2005mg and placebo for flare rate or time to first flare. Analysis of atacicept 150\u2005mg suggested benefit.

Methods This phase III, 52-week study randomised 1164 patients with moderate-to-severe SLE (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment\u2014SLE Disease Activity Index \u22656 at baseline). Patients received SoC plus subcutaneous injections of tabalumab or placebo, starting with a loading dose (240\u2005mg) at week 0 and followed by 120\u2005mg every two\u2005weeks (120 Q2W, n=387), 120\u2005mg every four\u2005weeks (120 Q4W, n=389) or placebo Q2W (n=388). Primary endpoint: proportion of patients achieving SLE Responder Index 5 (SRI-5) response at week 52. Results Similar proportions of patients in each group achieved SRI-5 response at week 52 (120 Q2W: 31.8%; 120 Q4W: 35.2% and placebo: 29.3%). Key secondary endpoints were not met. In a sensitivity analysis not excluding patients who decreased antimalarials or immunosuppressants, SRI-5 response was achieved with 120 Q4W (37.0% vs 29.8% placebo; p=0.021), but not 120 Q2W (34.1%; p=0.171). Significant reductions in anti-dsDNA antibodies, increases in C3 and C4, and reductions in total B cells and immunoglobulins were observed with tabalumab. No differences were observed between treatment groups in percentage of deaths (120 Q2W: 0.8%; 120 Q4W: 0.5%; placebo: 0.5%), serious adverse events (AEs) (range 11.1\u201314.4%) or treatment-emergent AEs (range 81.1\u201382.3%). Conclusions Tabalumab had biological activity\u2014changes in anti-dsDNA, complement, B cells and immunoglobulins\u2014consistent with BAFF pathway inhibition.

            "abstract": "Abnormalities in B cells play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). Breach in central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms generates autoreactive B cells which contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE and LN. Dysregulation of B cell transcription factors, cytokines and B cell\u2013T cell interaction can result in aberrant B cell maturation and autoantibody production. These immunological abnormalities also lead to perturbations in circulating and infiltrating B cells in SLE and LN patients. Conventional and novel immunosuppressive medications confer differential effects on B cells which have important clinical implications. While cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) showed comparable clinical efficacy in active LN, MMF induction was associated with earlier reduction in circulating plasmablasts and plasma cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that MMF maintenance is associated with lower risk of disease relapse than azathioprine, which may be explained by its more potent and selective suppression of B cell proliferation. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting the B cell repertoire include B cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies binding to cell surface markers, inhibition of B cell cytokines, and modulation of costimulatory signals in B cell\u2013T cell interaction. These biologics, despite showing improvements in serological parameters and proteinuria, did not achieve primary endpoints when used as add-on therapy to standard treatments in active LN patients. Other emerging treatments such as calcineurin inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors also show distinct inhibitory effects on the B cell repertoire. Advancement in the knowledge on B cell biology has fueled the development of new therapeutic strategies in SLE and LN. Modification in background treatments, study endpoints and selective recruitment of subjects showing aberrant B cells or its signaling pathways when designing future clinical trials may better elucidate the roles of these novel therapies for SLE and LN patients.",

            "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by B cell dysregulation and breaks in tolerance that lead to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of B cells from healthy donors and individuals with SLE which revealed upregulated CD52 expression in SLE patients. We further demonstrate that SLE patients exhibit significantly increased levels of B cell surface CD52 expression and plasma soluble CD52, and levels of soluble CD52 positively correlate with measures of lupus disease activity. Using CD52-deficient JeKo-1 cells, we show that cells lacking surface CD52 expression are hyperresponsive to B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, suggesting an inhibitory role for the surface-bound protein. In healthy donor B cells, antigen-specific BCR-activation initiated CD52 cleavage in a phospholipase C dependent manner, significantly reducing cell surface levels. Experiments with recombinant CD52-Fc showed that soluble CD52 inhibits BCR signaling in a manner partially-dependent on Siglec-10. Moreover, incubation of unstimulated B cells with CD52-Fc resulted in the reduction of surface immunoglobulin and CXCR5. Prolonged incubation of B cells with CD52 resulted in the expansion of IgD+IgMlo anergic B cells. In summary, our findings suggest that CD52 functions as a homeostatic protein on B cells, by inhibiting responses to BCR signaling. Further, our data demonstrate that CD52 is cleaved from the B cell surface upon antigen engagement, and can suppress B cell function in an autocrine and paracrine manner. We propose that increased expression of CD52 by B cells in SLE represents a homeostatic mechanism to suppress B cell hyperactivity.",

Further, our data demonstrate that CD52 is cleaved from the B cell surface upon antigen engagement, and can suppress B cell function in an autocrine and paracrine manner. We propose that increased expression of CD52 by B cells in SLE represents a homeostatic mechanism to suppress B cell hyperactivity.",

            "abstract": "The immune\u2010modulating protein CD52 attenuates lymphocyte function and is associated with autoimmune disorders, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS). CD52 represents a therapeutic target in MS and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Its expression has prognostic and predictive value in CLL and is prognostic in breast cancer. Its significance in melanoma is unclear. We analyzed CD52 mRNA expression data from tumor bulk tissues of N\u2009=\u2009445 untreated melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network and of N\u2009=\u2009121 melanoma patients undergoing anti\u2010PD\u20101 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with regard to outcome (overall survival [OS], disease control [DC], and progression\u2010free survival [PFS]), single\u2010cell RNA\u2010Seq data of N\u2009=\u20094645 cells from N\u2009=\u200919 melanoma tissues, and N\u2009=\u200915,457 cells from normal skin provided by N\u2009=\u20095 donors. Higher CD52 mRNA expression was associated with favorable OS (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.820, [95% CI 0.734\u20130.916], p\u2009<\u2009.001) in non\u2010ICB\u2010treated melanoma and with PFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.875, [95% CI 0.775\u20130.989], p\u2009=\u2009.033) and DC (p\u2009=\u2009.005) in ICB\u2010treated melanoma. CD52 expression correlated significantly with distinct immune cell subsets and correlated negatively with immune checkpoint expression in T cells. Moreover, our results suggest CD52 expression by a certain type of tissue\u2010resident macrophages. CD52 mRNA was expressed in a small subgroup (8%) of immune checkpoint coexpressing melanoma cells. CD52 expression is associated with features of ICB response in melanoma. Concomitant ICB and anti\u2010CD52 treatment requires critical review.",
