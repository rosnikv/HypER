However, the clinically relevant question as to whether doxycycline also modifies symptoms in knee osteoarthritis is unanswered. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of doxycycline on pain and daily functioning in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Methods A 24-week, randomised, triple-blind, placebo controlled trial on the symptomatic effectiveness of doxycycline twice a day 100 mg in knee osteoarthritis patients according to the clinical and radiological American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportion of participants in both study groups achieving a clinical response defined by the OMERACT\u2013OARSI set of responder criteria. Secondary endpoints included pain, stiffness, daily functioning, patient global assessment, quality of life, osteoarthritis-related medication and side effects. Results 232 patients were randomly assigned. At study end, 31% of participants met the primary endpoint in both groups. Except for more adverse events in the doxycycline group, no differences were also found on the secondary endpoints. Conclusions Doxycycline is not effective in reducing symptoms in knee osteoarthritis patients over a 24-week study period, but is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Although a possible structure-modifying effect of doxycycline was previously suggested, this is not accompanied by symptom relief in the short and medium term. Dutch Trial Register no NTR1111.",

            "abstract": "Objectives Evidence suggests that doxycycline might have disease-modifying properties in osteoarthritis. However, the clinically relevant question as to whether doxycycline also modifies symptoms in knee osteoarthritis is unanswered. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of doxycycline on pain and daily functioning in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Methods A 24-week, randomised, triple-blind, placebo controlled trial on the symptomatic effectiveness of doxycycline twice a day 100 mg in knee osteoarthritis patients according to the clinical and radiological American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportion of participants in both study groups achieving a clinical response defined by the OMERACT\u2013OARSI set of responder criteria. Secondary endpoints included pain, stiffness, daily functioning, patient global assessment, quality of life, osteoarthritis-related medication and side effects. Results 232 patients were randomly assigned. At study end, 31% of participants met the primary endpoint in both groups. Except for more adverse events in the doxycycline group, no differences were also found on the secondary endpoints. Conclusions Doxycycline is not effective in reducing symptoms in knee osteoarthritis patients over a 24-week study period, but is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Although a possible structure-modifying effect of doxycycline was previously suggested, this is not accompanied by symptom relief in the short and medium term. Dutch Trial Register no NTR1111.",

            "abstract": "Tetracyclines, which have long been used as broad-spectrum antibiotics, also exhibit a variety of nonantibiotic activities including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Tetracyclines bind to the 30S ribosome of the bacteria and inhibit protein synthesis. Unlike antimicrobial activity, the primary molecular target for the nonantibiotic activity of tetracycline remains to be clarified. Nonetheless, the therapeutic efficacies of tetracyclines, particularly minocycline and doxycycline, have been demonstrated in various animal models of autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. In this study, we summarized the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of tetracyclines, focusing on the mechanisms underlying these activities. In addition, we highlighted the on-going or completed clinical trials with reported outcomes.",

            "abstract": "The pharmacological manipulation of neuroinflammation appears to be a promising strategy to alleviate l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Doxycycline (Doxy), a semisynthetic brain-penetrant tetracycline antibiotic having interesting anti-inflammatory properties, we addressed the possibility that this compound could resolve LID in l-DOPA-treated C57BL/6 mice presenting either moderate or intermediate lesions of the mesostriatal dopaminergic pathway generated by intrastriatal injections of 6-OHDA. Doxy, when given subcutaneously before l-DOPA at doses of 20 mg kg\u22121 and 40 mg kg\u22121, led to significant LID reduction in mice with moderate and intermediate dopaminergic lesions, respectively. Importantly, Doxy did not reduce locomotor activity improved by l-DOPA. To address the molecular mechanism of Doxy, we sacrificed mice with mild lesions 1) to perform the immunodetection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Fos-B and 2) to evaluate a panel of inflammation markers in the striatum, such as cyclooxygenase-2 and its downstream product Prostaglandin E2 along with the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. TH-immunodetection revealed that vehicle and Doxy-treated mice had similar striatal lesions, excluding that LID improvement by Doxy could result from neurorestorative effects. Importantly, LID inhibition by Doxy was associated with decreased Fos-B and COX-2 expression and reduced levels of PGE2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in the dorsolateral striatum of dyskinetic mice. We conclude 1) that Doxy has the potential to prevent LID regardless of the intensity of dopaminergic lesioning and 2) that the anti-inflammatory effects of Doxy probably account for LID attenuation. Overall, the present results further indicate that Doxy might represent an attractive and alternative treatment for LID in PD.",
