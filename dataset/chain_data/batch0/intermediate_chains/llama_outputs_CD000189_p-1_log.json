The women who were admitted to the trial were those who, following full-term vaginal delivery, required an analgesic agent for control of their pain.

Pain intensity, movement restriction and extent of swelling in the episiotomy were recorded prior to treatment and at intervals of 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. The difference scores of pain intensity, movement restriction and extent of swelling were calculated from the differences between pretreatment and post-treatment values. By all methods of evaluation, ibuprofen was significantly more effective than placebo at 1 and 3 days after the initiation of the treatment.

This study aimed to compare the effect of serum physiological (SP) and rivanol on the process of recovery and perineal pain during episiotomy care. Patients and Methods: The study was conducted with 60 primiparous women. During the process of data collection, rivanol was used for episiotomy care of the first 30 mothers who met the inclusion criteria (Group 1). Serum physiological was used in Group 2. The first data were collected in the first four hours of the postpartum in the hospital. Mothers were invited to the hospital for the evaluations on 7th, 14th, and 21st days. Episiotomy wound was evaluated with REEDA score and pain with Visual Analog Scale. Results: In episiotomy healing process, there was a difference between groups in favor of SP according to total scores of REEDA on the 7th, 14th and 21st days. There was a difference in SP group with respect to pain on the 21st day. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, SP was found to be more effective than rivanol in episiotomy healing. Therefore, the use of SP, which is non-chemical and has no side effects to the healing process, is suggested in episiotomy care.
