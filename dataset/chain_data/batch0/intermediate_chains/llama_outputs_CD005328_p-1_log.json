            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether triamcinolone acetonide diffuses from the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) to the navicular bursa, diffusion is direct or systemic, and addition of sodium hyaluronan has an effect on diffusion in horses.\n\n\nANIMALS\n11 adult horses without forelimb lameness.\n\n\nPROCEDURES\n1 randomly chosen forelimb DIPJ of each horse received an injection of 10 mg of triamcinolone acetonide plus 20 mg of sodium hyaluronan (group 1), and the contralateral forelimb DIPJ received an injection of 10 mg of triamcinolone acetonide plus 2 mL of lactated Ringer's solution (group 2). Synovial fluid samples were taken from both forelimb navicular bursae and 1 hind limb navicular bursa (systemic control group) at 6 hours. Triamcinolone acetonide concentrations in synovial fluid were quantified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography plus tandem mass spectrometry. Data were logarithmically transformed, and contrast analysis was performed on the 3 groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTriamcinolone acetonide was detected in navicular bursal samples in all groups. Groups 1 and 2 had significantly greater concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide than the systemic control group. There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nTriamcinolone acetonide diffused directly from the DIPJ into the navicular bursa in clinically normal horses, and diffusion was not affected by addition of hyaluronan. Injection into the DIPJ with triamcinolone acetonide or a triamcinolone acetonide-hyaluronan combination can potentially be used for treatment of navicular syndrome, but further studies are needed to determine whether triamcinolone acetonide diffuses similarly in horses with navicular syndrome.",

We have developed an ultrasound-guided, lateral needle approach to navicular bursocentesis, which avoids penetration of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) and the need for radiographic control.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe and evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an ultrasound-guided, lateral bursocentesis technique.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nCadaveric and in vivo experiments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe navicular bursa in 62 cadaveric forelimbs of 31 horses and in both forelimbs of 26 live horses, positioned with the foot flexed in a navicular block, were submitted to lateral, ultrasound-guided injection of 1.5 ml radiocontrast agent. Lateromedial radiographs were taken to locate the contrast. A second injection of 0.5 ml methylene blue was administered during needle withdrawal in cadaveric limbs to investigate the needle pathway during dissection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nContrast agent was successfully deposited in the navicular bursa in 104 of 114 (91%) limbs and in the navicular bursa alone in 89 of 114 (78%) limbs. Dissection showed no evidence of penetration of the DDFT in cadaver limbs. Failure to inject the navicular bursa was significantly associated with poor quality of the ultrasound image (P = 0.04) and resulted in aberrant injection of the distal interphalangeal joint in five of 114 (4%) limbs, the peribursal soft tissues in four of 114 (4%) limbs and the digital flexor tendon sheath in one of 114 (0.9%) limbs. Synovial fluid was observed at the needle hub in 58% of live horses.\n\n\nMAIN LIMITATIONS\nIt is unknown whether injection results obtained in the limbs of horses without disease can be extrapolated to horses with clinical disease of the podotrochlear apparatus. The localisation of contrast medium on radiographs may not accurately reflect the behaviour of local anaesthetic solution or therapeutic medications injected in the navicular bursa.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis lateral, ultrasound-guided technique for injecting the navicular bursa is effective, does not penetrate the DDFT and avoids exposure of personnel to radiation.",

Previous anatomical and radiographic studies of the communication between these synovial structures have produced conflicting results and did not identify the location of any communication if present. This anatomic study aimed to assess the presence and site of communication between the distal interphalangeal joint and the navicular bursa in the horse by computed tomography arthrography. Sixty\u2010six pairs of cadaver forelimbs were injected with contrast medium into the distal interphalangeal joint and imaged by computed tomography arthrography. The presence of a communication, location of the communication and additional structural changes were assessed. Navicular bursa opacification occurred in 7 distal limbs (5.3%) following distal interphalangeal joint injection. One limb showed a communication through the T\u2010ligament and 6 limbs showed a communication through the distal sesamoidean impar ligament. In 3 cases, the communication through the distal sesamoidean impar ligament was associated with a distal border fragment. Our study showed that communication between the distal interphalangeal joint and navicular bursa is uncommon and inconsistent. Clinically, the presence of a communication could (1) influence the interpretation of diagnostic analgesia of the distal interphalangeal joint or the navicular bursa by facilitating the diffusion of local anaesthetic between these structures; (2) allow the drug and its potential adverse effects to spread from the treated synovial cavity to the non\u2010targeted synovial cavity; (3) be responsible for the failure of joint drainage in the case of sepsis.",
