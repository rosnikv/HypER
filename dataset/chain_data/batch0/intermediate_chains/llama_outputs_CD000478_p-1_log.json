            "abstract": "AIM\nTo evaluate the role of azathioprine (AZA) in Indian patients with ulcerative colitis over longer duration of time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred fifty six patients with ulcerative colitis who were treated with AZA from January 1995 to December 2003 were reviewed. The indications for its use were as follows: (1) steroid dependent and steroid refractory disease; (2) Azathioprine monotherapy for naive patients with severe disease; and (3) combination therapy (AZA + sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates) for naive patients with severe disease. The data included patient and disease demographics, efficacy and toxicity profile of AZA. Patients with a minimum duration of 6 mo use of AZA were included in this report.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf a total of 156 patients treated with AZA, 45 were excluded from analysis for the following reasons- (follow up less than 6 mo, n = 9; poor follow up, n = 18; adverse affects, n = 18). In steroid refractory/dependent group the mean number of relapses prior to and post initiation of AZA therapy were 3.28 (+/- 0.81) and 0.94 (+/- 0.29) respectively. Discontinuation of steroids could be accomplished in 12 of the 15 steroid dependent patients. The proportion of patients with sustained remission of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years duration were calculated. Eighteen patients experienced adverse effects necessitating withdrawal of AZA (pancreatitis, n = 7; hepatitis, n = 3; gastrointestinal intolerance, n = 2; alopecia, n = 2; and hematological, n = 4) while 13 patients needed dose reduction or temporary withdrawal of the drug.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAzathioprine is well tolerated and has therapeutic benefits lasting as long as 4 years. Adverse effects such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, cytopenias and gastrointestinal symptoms do occur but are controlled by drug withdrawal only.",

Mucin 1 (MUC1) is overexpressed in an abnormal, hypoglycosylated form on the colonic epithelium in human IBD where it contributes to inflammation. MUC1 is also expressed on pancreatic ductal epithelia. We tested the possibility that in IBD, MUC1 expression on pancreatic ducts is also abnormal leading to inflammation and pancreatitis. Methods: We used MUC1+/interleukin-10\u2212/\u2212 mice that develop IBD. We imaged abnormal MUC1 expression in these mice by adoptively transferring T cells from T cell receptor transgenic mice specific for abnormal MUC1. Cells were labeled with a novel perfluorocarbon tracer reagent and quantified and visualized in vivo using high-throughput 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: MUC1-specific T cells migrated to the colon in mice with IBD and also to the pancreas. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased expression on the pancreatic ducts of the abnormal MUC1 seen in the colon and the presence of cellular infiltrate. Conclusions: Migration of MUC1-specific T cells to the colon and the pancreas in diseased mice suggests that pancreatitis is an extraintestinal site of IBD, characterized by proinflammatory abnormal expression of MUC1. Therapies directed against abnormal MUC1 have the potential of targeting the disease in both sites.",

Muc1 is a component of the colonic mucus, which functions as a lubricant and a physiologic barrier between luminal contents and mucosal surface. The gene MUC1 has been associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease; we investigated the role of Muc1 in development of colitis in mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMuc1 and RAG1 were disrupted in mice (Muc/RAG double knockout mice); Th1-mediated colitis was induced by intravenous injection of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells. We also studied Th2-mediated colitis using mice with disruptions in Muc1 and T-cell receptor \u03b1 chain (Muc/TCR double knockout mice).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMuc1 deficiency led to the development of more severe forms of Th1- and Th2-induced colitis than controls. Loss of Muc1 increased colonic permeability and the Th17-cell, but not Th2 or Th1 cell, response in the inflamed colon. Loss of Muc1 also promoted expansion of an innate lymphoid cell population (Lin(-) ckit(-) Thy1(+) Sca1(+)) that produces IL-17. The expansion of Th17 adaptive immune cells and innate lymphoid cells required the commensal microbiota.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMuc1, which is up-regulated by Th17 signaling, functions in a negative feedback pathway that prevents an excessive Th17 cell response in inflamed colons of mice. Disruption of this negative feedback pathway, perhaps by variants in Muc1, might contribute to inflammatory bowel disease in patients.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen that is aberrantly expressed in cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Even though immune cells express low MUC1 levels, their modulations of MUC1 are important in tumor progression. Consistent with previous clinical data that show increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in IBD, we now show that downregulation of MUC1 on hematopoietic cells increases MDSCs in IBD, similar to our data in tumor-bearing mice. We hypothesize that MDSC expansion in IBD is critical for tumor progression. Experimental Design: To mechanistically confirm the linkage between Muc1 downregulation and MDSC expansion, we generated chimeric mice that did not express Muc1 in the hematopoietic compartment (KO\u2192WT). These mice were used in two models of colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and their responses were compared with wild-type (WT) chimeras (WT\u2192WT). Results: KO\u2192WT mice show increased levels of MDSCs during colitis and increased protumorigenic signaling in the colon during CAC, resulting in larger colon tumors. RNA and protein analysis show increased upregulation of metalloproteinases, collagenases, defensins, complements, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines in KO\u2192WT mice as compared with WT\u2192WT mice. Antibody-mediated depletion of MDSCs in mice during colitis reduced colon tumor formation during CAC. Conclusion: Development of CAC is a serious complication of colitis and our data highlight MDSCs as a targetable link between inflammation and cancer. In addition, the lack of MUC1 expression on MDSCs can be a novel marker for MDSCs, given that MDSCs are still not well characterized in human cancers.

            "abstract": "In cancer cells, the glycoprotein Mucin 1 (MUC1) undergoes abnormal, truncated glycosylation. The truncated glycosylation exposes cryptic peptide epitopes that can be recognized by antibodies. Since these immunogenic regions are cancer specific, they represent ideal targets for therapeutic antibodies. We investigated the role of tumor-specific glycosylation on antigen recognition by the therapeutic antibody AR20.5. We explored the affinity of AR20.5 to a synthetic cancer-specific MUC1 glycopeptide and peptide. The antibody bound to the glycopeptide with an order of magnitude stronger affinity than the naked peptide. Given these results, we postulated that AR20.5 must specifically bind the carbohydrate as well as the peptide. Using X-ray crystallography, we examined this hypothesis by determining the structure of AR20.5 in complex with both peptide and glycopeptide. Surprisingly, the structure revealed that the carbohydrate did not form any specific polar contacts with the antibody. The high affinity of AR20.5 for the glycopeptide and the lack of specific binding contacts support a hypothesis that glycosylation of MUC1 stabilizes an extended bioactive conformation of the peptide recognized by the antibody. Since high affinity binding of AR20.5 to the MUC1 glycopeptide may not driven by specific antibody-antigen contacts, but rather evidence suggests that glycosylation alters the conformational equilibrium of the antigen, which allows the antibody to select the correct conformation. This study suggests a novel mechanism of antibody-antigen interaction and also suggests that glycosylation of MUC1 is important for the generation of high affinity therapeutic antibodies.",

                    "explanation": "This paper has no connection with the source paper. The source paper explores the role of glycosylation on the ensemble of conformations in the MUC1 immunodominant epitope, whereas this paper discusses the determination of primary structure of glycans by NMR spectroscopy, which is a general methodological paper and does not build upon or depend on the findings of the source paper.",
