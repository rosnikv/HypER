The primary efficacy end point was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rate of the primary efficacy end point was 6.8 percent with clopidogrel plus aspirin and 7.3 percent with placebo plus aspirin (relative risk, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.05; P=0.22). The respective rate of the principal secondary efficacy end point, which included hospitalizations for ischemic events, was 16.7 percent and 17.9 percent (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.995; P=0.04), and the rate of severe bleeding was 1.7 percent and 1.3 percent (relative risk, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.61 percent; P=0.09).

The concept of antiplatelet drug \"resistance\" emerged during the 1990s with studies revealing considerable residual platelet aggregation in some patients despite aspirin treatment. In the wake of these reports, larger studies established an association between high on-treatment platelet reactivity and thrombotic events. The possible mechanisms explaining this phenomenon are manifold and reflect the complexity of platelet function, thrombus formation and cardiovascular disease. Some mechanisms apply to both drugs, while others apply only to one of them. In recent years, efforts have been made to translate this information into an improved clinical outcome by modifying antiplatelet drug regimens. Several studies investigated measurements of on-treatment platelet reactivity, but large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate substantial clinical benefit of individually tailored antiplatelet therapy according to platelet function tests. This article provides an integrated review of interindividual variability in the efficacy of aspirin and clopidogrel with particular emphasis on possible effect-modifying mechanisms and clinical implications.",

The concept of antiplatelet drug \"resistance\" emerged during the 1990s with studies revealing considerable residual platelet aggregation in some patients despite aspirin treatment. In the wake of these reports, larger studies established an association between high on-treatment platelet reactivity and thrombotic events. The possible mechanisms explaining this phenomenon are manifold and reflect the complexity of platelet function, thrombus formation and cardiovascular disease. Some mechanisms apply to both drugs, while others apply only to one of them. In recent years, efforts have been made to translate this information into an improved clinical outcome by modifying antiplatelet drug regimens. Several studies investigated measurements of on-treatment platelet reactivity, but large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate substantial clinical benefit of individually tailored antiplatelet therapy according to platelet function tests. This article provides an integrated review of interindividual variability in the efficacy of aspirin and clopidogrel with particular emphasis on possible effect-modifying mechanisms and clinical implications.",

A genetic etiology likely exists, but it remains unclear to what extent genetic polymorphisms determine platelet aggregation in aspirin-treated individuals. Aim To identify platelet-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing platelet aggregation during aspirin treatment. Furthermore, we explored to what extent changes in cyclooxygenase-1 activity and platelet activation may explain such influence. Methods We included 985 Danish patients with stable coronary artery disease treated with aspirin 75 mg/day mono antiplatelet therapy. Patients were genotyped for 16 common SNPs in platelet-related genes using standard PCR-based methods (TaqMan). Platelet aggregation was evaluated by whole blood platelet aggregometry employing Multiplate Analyzer (agonists: arachidonic acid and collagen) and VerifyNow Aspirin. Serum thromboxane B2 was measured to confirm aspirin adherence and was used as a marker of cyclooxygenase-1 activity. Soluble P-selectin was used as marker of platelet activation. Platelet aggregation, cyclooxygenase-1 activity, and platelet activation were compared across genotypes in adjusted analyses. Results The A-allele of the rs12041331 SNP in the platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1 (PEAR1) gene was associated with reduced platelet aggregation and increased platelet activation, but not with cyclooxygenase-1 activity. Platelet aggregation was unaffected by the other SNPs analyzed. Conclusion A common genetic variant in PEAR1 (rs12041331) reproducibly influenced platelet aggregation in aspirin-treated patients with coronary artery disease. The exact biological mechanism remains elusive, but the effect of this polymorphism may be related to changes in platelet activation. Furthermore, 14 SNPs previously suggested to influence aspirin efficacy were not associated with on-aspirin platelet aggregation. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01383304",
