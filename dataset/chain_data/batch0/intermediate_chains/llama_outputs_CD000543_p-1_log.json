We directly compared the efficacy and safety of two mesalamine formulations for the induction of remission in patients with UC. Methods: In a multicenter, double\u2010blind, randomized study, 229 patients with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate active UC were assigned to 4 groups: 66 and 65 received a pH\u2010dependent release formulation of 2.4 g/day (pH\u20102.4 g) or 3.6 g/day (pH\u20103.6 g), respectively; 65 received a time\u2010dependent release formulation of 2.25 g/day (Time\u20102.25 g), and 33 received placebo (Placebo). The drugs were administered three times daily for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was a decrease in the UC disease activity index (UC\u2010DAI). Results: In the full analysis set (n = 225) the decrease in UC\u2010DAI in each group was 1.5 in pH\u20102.4 g, 2.9 in pH\u20103.6 g, 1.3 in Time\u20102.25 g and 0.3 in Placebo, respectively. These results demonstrate the superiority of pH\u20103.6 g over Time\u20102.25 g (P = 0.003) and the noninferiority of pH\u20102.4 g to Time\u20102.25 g. Among the patients with proctitis\u2010type UC, a significant decrease in UC\u2010DAI was observed in pH\u20102.4 g and pH\u20103.6 g as compared to Placebo, but not in Time\u20102.25 g. No differences were observed in the safety profiles. Conclusions: Higher dose of the pH\u2010dependent release formulation was more effective for induction of remission in patients with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate active UC. Additionally, the pH\u2010dependent release formulation was preferable to the time\u2010dependent release formulation for patients with proctitis\u2010type UC (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, no.

A retrospective observational analysis of clinical outcomes was performed using the clinical activity index (CAI) obtained on the day of biopsy. Colonic mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA in biopsy samples were measured by LC-tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Patients who were treated with the pH-dependent formulation had higher colon mucosal concentrations of 5-ASA than those who were treated with the time-dependent formulation. Additionally, 5-ASA concentration was significantly higher in patients with CAI scores \u22643. A higher concentration of Ac-5-ASA was achieved with the time-dependent formulation than with the pH-dependent formulation. Furthermore, patients with CAI scores \u22643 had higher concentrations of 5-ASA than those with CAI scores \u22654. The colonic mucosal concentration of 5-ASA in patients with UC is influenced by the pharmaceutical formulation and the remission status of UC.",

            "abstract": "Background: Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the mainstay treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and therapy with oral 5-ASA is associated with beneficial outcomes. We have examined factors associated with the persistence of oral 5-ASA treatment in a national cohort of UC patients. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed UC from 2010 to 2014 using oral 5-ASA monotherapy were identified by combining data from the Norwegian Patient Registry and the Norwegian Prescription Database. The median follow-up time was 1029\u2009days. Drug persistence was defined as duration of oral 5-ASA preparation as monotherapy. Non-persistence of a oral 5-ASA preparation as monotherapy was defined as stopping oral 5-ASA, initiation of any further anti-inflammatory treatment including a course of glucocorticoids and a change to another oral 5-ASA preparation. Drug persistence was analyzed using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and influence of covariates on drug persistence was analyzed with the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: A total of 3421 patients were identified. The overall median 5-ASA drug persistence was 179\u2009days. In univariate analyses, persistence was associated with preparation type and high-dose treatment, while oral glucocorticoid use or hospitalization around the start of oral 5-ASA were associated with shorter 5-ASA persistence. In multivariate analyses, oral glucocorticoids [HR 1.67 (1.54\u20131.80), p\u2009<\u20090.005] and hospitalization around start of 5-ASA [HR 1.23 (1.14\u20131.34), p\u2009<\u20090.005] were associated with non-persistence, whereas high dose (\u2a7e3\u2009g/day) 5-ASA was associated with longer persistence [HR 0.68 (0.65\u20130.71), p\u2009<\u20090.005]. Conclusion: High-dose treatment with oral 5-ASA was associated with longer persistence of oral 5-ASA monotherapy, whereas the presence of factors indicating more severe disease around initiation of 5-ASA monotherapy was associated with a shorter persistence.",
