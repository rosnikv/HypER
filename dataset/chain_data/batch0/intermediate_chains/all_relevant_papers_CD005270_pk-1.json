        "abstract": "Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and complications is an urgent problem in modern medicine. In patients with a body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m2, indicators of markers of carbohydrate metabolism (serum glucose -fasting and postprandial glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin and urine glucose) and lipid metabolism -total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), lipidogram (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol -LDL cholesterol, atherogenic index -AI is significantly higher, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol -HDL cholesterol is significantly lower than in patients with normal body mass index (BMI) and abdominal index (AI). Asignificant positive relationship between age, abdominal index, BMI, AI, glucose level in blood serum. Assessment of markers of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism should be included in the list of mandatory examinations of patients over the age of 30 years, and be strictly individual. There is a relationship between the progression of carbohydrate metabolism disorders and changes in lipid parameters metabolism in the examined women.The population should be widely informed about the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the progression of complications.",

        "explanation": "This paper is relevant to the source paper as it discusses the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is closely related to the worsening of impaired glucose tolerance ('borderline diabetes') investigated in the source paper. The paper explores strategies for preventing the development of diabetes, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, which could be seen as building upon the findings of the source paper."
