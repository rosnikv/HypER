        "abstract": "Abstract Background There is a large body of evidence evaluating quality improvement (QI) programmes to improve care for adults living with diabetes. These programmes are often comprised of multiple QI strategies, which may be implemented in various combinations. Decision\u2010makers planning to implement or evaluate a new QI programme, or both, need reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness of different QI strategies (individually and in combination) for different patient populations. Objectives To update existing systematic reviews of diabetes QI programmes and apply novel meta\u2010analytical techniques to estimate the effectiveness of QI strategies (individually and in combination) on diabetes quality of care. Search methods We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 4 June 2019. We conducted a top\u2010up search to 23 September 2021; we screened these search results and 42 studies meeting our eligibility criteria are available in the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria We included randomised trials that assessed a QI programme to improve care in outpatient settings for people living with diabetes. QI programmes needed to evaluate at least one system\u2010 or provider\u2010targeted QI strategy alone or in combination with a patient\u2010targeted strategy. \u2010 System\u2010targeted: case management (CM); team changes (TC); electronic patient registry (EPR); facilitated relay of clinical information (FR); continuous quality improvement (CQI). \u2010 Provider\u2010targeted: audit and feedback (AF); clinician education (CE); clinician reminders (CR); financial incentives (FI). \u2010 Patient\u2010targeted: patient education (PE); promotion of self\u2010management (PSM); patient reminders (PR). Patient\u2010targeted QI strategies needed to occur with a minimum of one provider or system\u2010targeted strategy. Data collection and analysis We dual\u2010screened search results and abstracted data on study design, study population and QI strategies. We assessed the impact of the programmes on 13 measures of diabetes care, including: glycaemic control (e.g. mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)); cardiovascular risk factor management (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), proportion of people living with diabetes that quit smoking or receiving cardiovascular medications); and screening/prevention of microvascular complications (e.g. proportion of patients receiving retinopathy or foot screening); and harms (e.g. proportion of patients experiencing adverse hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia). We modelled the association of each QI strategy with outcomes using a series of hierarchical multivariable meta\u2010regression models in a Bayesian framework. The previous version of this review identified that different strategies were more or less effective depending on baseline levels of outcomes. To explore this further, we extended the main additive model for continuous outcomes (HbA1c, SBP and LDL\u2010C) to include an interaction term between each strategy and average baseline risk for each study (baseline thresholds were based on a data\u2010driven approach; we used the median of all baseline values reported in the trials). Based on model diagnostics, the baseline interaction models for HbA1c, SBP and LDL\u2010C performed better than the main model and are therefore presented as the primary analyses for these outcomes. Based on the model results, we qualitatively ordered each QI strategy within three tiers (Top, Middle, Bottom) based on its magnitude of effect relative to the other QI strategies, where 'Top' indicates that the QI strategy was likely one of the most effective strategies for that specific outcome. Secondary analyses explored the sensitivity of results to choices in model specification and priors. Additional information about the methods and results of the review are available as Appendices in an online repository. This review will be maintained as a living systematic review; we will update our syntheses as more data become available. Main results We identified 553 trials (428 patient\u2010randomised and 125 cluster\u2010randomised trials), including a total of 412,161 participants. Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow\u2010up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted. Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population\u2010level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three. Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects: \u2010 PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) \u20100.61 to \u20100.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; \u2010 CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI \u20100.84 to \u20100.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%; \u2010 PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI \u20103.80 to \u20100.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; \u2010 CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI \u20106.20 to \u20102.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg; \u2010 TC + PE + CM: LDL\u2010C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI \u20107.93 to \u20103.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; \u2010 TC + CM + CR: LDL\u2010C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI \u20109.24 to \u20101.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL. Assuming a baseline screening rate of 50%, the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to an absolute improvement of 33% in retinopathy screening (PE + PR + TC) and 38% absolute increase in foot screening (PE + TC + Other). Authors' conclusions There is a significant body of evidence about QI programmes to improve the management of diabetes. Multicomponent QI programmes for diabetes care (comprised of effective QI strategies) may achieve meaningful population\u2010level improvements across the majority of outcomes. For health system decision\u2010makers, the evidence summarised in this review can be used to identify strategies to include in QI programmes. For researchers, this synthesis identifies higher\u2010priority QI strategies to examine in further research regarding how to optimise their evaluation and effects. We will maintain this as a living systematic review.",

        "explanation": "This paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluates quality improvement strategies for diabetes care. While it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings or hypothesis, it does discuss patient education as an effective quality improvement strategy, which is related to the source paper's focus on patient education and dietary instructions."
