The groups were matched on propensity scores, were followed for 3 years, and retained medical and dental benefits. Receipt of dental care was defined as 1 or more dental visits in each 12-month period.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nOutcome measures were assessed in a subpopulation that qualified for 1 of 5 HEDIS denominator groups (dental = 4184 patients; nondental = 3871 patients). They included 3 preventive measures (cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer screening), 4 chronic disease management services (hemoglobin A1c and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol testing, and nephropathy and retinopathy screening among the diabetes mellitus [DM] population), and 4 health outcome measures (poor glycemic control, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control, blood pressure control in the DM population, and blood pressure control in the hypertensive population).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDental care was associated with higher adherence to all three cancer screening measures, one of four disease management services (higher retinopathy screening), and three of four health outcomes (better glycemic control in the DM population and better blood pressure control in the DM and hypertensive populations).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDental care was associated with improved adherence to 7 of 11 HEDIS measures.",

            "abstract": "There is a remarkable phenomenon occurring among health professionals: the development of ongoing, routine collaboration, both in educating the next generation of providers and in delivering care. These new approaches, commonly referred to as interprofessional education and interprofessional collaborative practice, have been introduced into academic health settings and delivery systems throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world; however, the full integration of dentistry in health care teams remains unrealized. In academic settings, dentistry has found ways to collaborate with the other health professions, but most practicing dentists still find themselves on the margins of new models of care delivery. This article provides a perspective on the history and context of the evolution of collaborative approaches to health care and proposes ways in which dentistry can participate more fully in the future.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges and American Dental Education Association have identified oral health knowledge, skills, and attitudes shared by both medical and dental professionals. Although oral health was deemed an essential competency for medical practitioners, our state struggled to ensure learners received proper training. This training deficit resulted in conducting a needs assessment and implementing an oral health interprofessional module at our schools.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFirst-year medical students and clinical faculty were emailed surveys in 2016 to obtain baseline information. A team of faculty and students from the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry reviewed the curriculum to determine where to augment oral health content. An oral health module to teach a basic head, neck, and oral examination to first-year medical students during their patient-centered care small-group sessions was implemented and evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 13.6% of faculty respondents were aware of national oral health competency recommendations, and <50% rated oral health important for primary care physicians (PCPs) to include in history, physical exam, or oral health counseling. On baseline, \u226425% of PCP respondents reported integrating the listed skills in their practice, and most indicated lacking expertise to teach oral health. Teaching sessions were rated helpful by students and faculty. After the teaching sessions, ratings on the importance of including oral health significantly increased from baseline.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCollaboration between Schools of Dentistry and Medicine successfully integrated oral health into medical school curriculum and improved the tutors' attitudes of its importance.",
