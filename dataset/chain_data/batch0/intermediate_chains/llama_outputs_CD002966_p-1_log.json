Patients on a diabetic diet alone or a diabetic diet together with a sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agent, with a fasting glucose greater than 1.4 g/l, on two measurements were included in the study. They were randomly allocated to two parallel groups and received either gliclazide or metformin. They were treated for three months and attended for consultation at one month and three months. The fasting serum insulin level decreased significantly in the group receiving metformin (26.2 +/- 3.2 mlU/L at entry versus 19.8 +/- 2.3 mlU/L after three months: less than 0.01), and increased in a non-significant way in the group receiving gliclazide (21.6 +/- 3 mlU/L versus 26.5 +/- 5 mlU/L after three months: NS). The difference between the two groups was significant (p less than 0.01). There was a comparable significant improvement in blood sugar levels during the three months in both patients receiving gliclazide and metformin. However, significant weight loss (p less than 0.05) occurred only in patients receiving metformin. There was an identical improvement in blood sugar control in both patients receiving gliclazide and metformin over the three months. On the other hand, fasting serum insulin levels decreased significantly in patients receiving metformin compared to gliclazide. The effect of metformin on serum insulin levels is probably due to its action on insulin resistance and its lack of effect on insulin secretion, in contrast to sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents like gliclazide.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effective longevity of combination double oral therapy before insulin or triple oral therapy is needed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of our first 100 patients with type 2 diabetes who were successfully transferred from twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin to a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 100 study patients, 40 had well-controlled plasma glucose (glycosylated hemoglobin levels <8.0%) with use of metformin and a sulfonylurea. Good glycemic control was achieved with triple oral therapy (a sulfonylurea, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione) in 14 patients and with a sulfonylurea, metformin, and evening-administered mixed NPH and regular insulin in 7. In addition, plasma glucose was effectively controlled with twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin in conjunction with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (or both) in 22 patients and with twice-daily mixed NPH and regular insulin alone in 17. The mean time (+/- standard error) from primary failure of sulfonylurea monotherapy to the time when a third hypoglycemic agent was needed was 7.9 +/- 1.1 years (95% confidence interval, 5.7 to 10.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhen oral monotherapy fails (that is, glycosylated hemoglobin values exceed 8.0%) in patients with type 2 diabetes, combination therapy with a sulfonylurea and metformin is potentially effective in maintaining glycemic control and avoiding the addition of insulin or a thiazolidinedione for a mean duration of 7.9 years.",

In the nine other patients (group B), triple oral therapy failed and the use of insulin was necessary after a mean duration of 30 months (range, 18 to 42); the mean HbA1c in these patients was 8.8 +/- 0.5%. Both group A and B gained similar amounts of weight during the study period (14.2 +/- 2.1 lb versus 11.6 +/- 3.8 lb, respectively; P = 0.54). A search for potential predictors of success or failure revealed that both groups had similar baseline characteristics, including age, duration of diabetes, weight, body mass index, HbA1c, and baseline stimulated C-peptide levels, and none of these factors demonstrated a significant correlation with the response to therapy. The only difference found between the two groups was a significant increase in the stimulated C-peptide levels (from 3.6 +/- 0.9 ng/mL to 5.2 +/- 1.1 ng/mL; P = 0.002) during follow-up in the group that had good glycemic control with triple oral therapy, in comparison with a nonsignificant increase (from 3.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mL to 4.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL; P = 0.46) in the group that failed to maintain glycemic control on triple oral therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTriple oral antidiabetic therapy is an effective long-term treatment for a substantial proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes who initially achieve glycemic control with triple oral therapy, particularly those in whom production of endogenous insulin is increased when a thiazolidinedione is added.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo report the status of 35 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 3 years after the initiation of triple oral antidiabetic therapy--with a sulfonylurea, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudy patients were assessed for the need for the addition of insulin, and follow-up clinical and laboratory findings were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt a mean follow-up of 37 months (range, 18 to 45), 26 (74%) of 35 patients (group A) had well-controlled blood glucose levels on triple oral therapy, with a mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 6.9 +/- 0.3% (upper limit of normal, 6.5%). In the nine other patients (group B), triple oral therapy failed and the use of insulin was necessary after a mean duration of 30 months (range, 18 to 42); the mean HbA1c in these patients was 8.8 +/- 0.5%. Both group A and B gained similar amounts of weight during the study period (14.2 +/- 2.1 lb versus 11.6 +/- 3.8 lb, respectively; P = 0.54). A search for potential predictors of success or failure revealed that both groups had similar baseline characteristics, including age, duration of diabetes, weight, body mass index, HbA1c, and baseline stimulated C-peptide levels, and none of these factors demonstrated a significant correlation with the response to therapy. The only difference found between the two groups was a significant increase in the stimulated C-peptide levels (from 3.6 +/- 0.9 ng/mL to 5.2 +/- 1.1 ng/mL; P = 0.002) during follow-up in the group that had good glycemic control with triple oral therapy, in comparison with a nonsignificant increase (from 3.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mL to 4.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL; P = 0.46) in the group that failed to maintain glycemic control on triple oral therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTriple oral antidiabetic therapy is an effective long-term treatment for a substantial proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes who initially achieve glycemic control with triple oral therapy, particularly those in whom production of endogenous insulin is increased when a thiazolidinedione is added.",

To confirm our previous observations, we designed and performed a prospective, randomized, and controlled study.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 17 subjects with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on a maximized oral antihyperglycemic double regimen of glimepiride and metformin, were randomized to the addition of rosiglitazone or insulin to their treatment regimens for a period of 6 months. At baseline and at 6 months, the following were performed: measurement of fasting plasma glucose, fasting proinsulin, and insulin levels; frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test; and glucagon stimulation test for C-peptide.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine subjects were randomized to the addition of 8 mg rosiglitazone, and eight subjects were randomized to the addition of one injection of insulin (premixed 70/30) before their evening meal. The treatment groups were well matched for age, duration of diabetes, and BMI. Most important, the HbA(1c) was well matched between groups before treatment (8.7 +/- 0.3 and 9.0 +/- 0.3%; NS) and at the end of the 6 months (7.8 +/- 0.5 and 7.8 +/- 0.3%; NS). After 6 months, at the end of the study, there was a significant improvement in acute insulin response to glucose in the rosiglitazone group (+15.3 microIU x ml(-1) x 10 min(-1); P < 0.001) that led to an increase in the disposition index from 0.18 at baseline to 4.18 at 6 months (P = 0.02). Furthermore, at the end of the study, the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio had decreased in the rosiglitazone group by 36% (P = 0.03) but did not change significantly in the insulin treatment group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRosiglitazone, but not insulin, induced a recovery of pancreatic beta-cell function, as evidenced by the restoration of the first-phase insulin response to glucose, improvement in the disposition index, and a decrease in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio in subjects with type 2 diabetes in whom oral antihyperglycemic therapy failed.

We show that a murine model of diabetes is associated with the development of ER stress in beta cells and that treatment with the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 significantly reduced biochemical markers of islet ER stress in vivo. Exendin-4 attenuated translational downregulation of insulin and improved cell survival in purified rat beta cells and in INS-1 cells following induction of ER stress in vitro. GLP-1R agonists significantly potentiated the induction of ATF-4 by ER stress and accelerated recovery from ER stress-mediated translational repression in INS-1 beta cells in a PKA-dependent manner. The effects of exendin-4 on the induction of ATF-4 were mediated via enhancement of ER stress-stimulated ATF-4 translation. Moreover, exendin-4 reduced ER stress-associated beta cell death in a PKA-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that GLP-1R signaling directly modulates the ER stress response leading to promotion of beta cell adaptation and survival.",

            "abstract": "Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis impairs insulin biosynthesis, beta cell survival, and glucose homeostasis. We show that a murine model of diabetes is associated with the development of ER stress in beta cells and that treatment with the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 significantly reduced biochemical markers of islet ER stress in vivo. Exendin-4 attenuated translational downregulation of insulin and improved cell survival in purified rat beta cells and in INS-1 cells following induction of ER stress in vitro. GLP-1R agonists significantly potentiated the induction of ATF-4 by ER stress and accelerated recovery from ER stress-mediated translational repression in INS-1 beta cells in a PKA-dependent manner. The effects of exendin-4 on the induction of ATF-4 were mediated via enhancement of ER stress-stimulated ATF-4 translation. Moreover, exendin-4 reduced ER stress-associated beta cell death in a PKA-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that GLP-1R signaling directly modulates the ER stress response leading to promotion of beta cell adaptation and survival.",

Chronic and s.c. administration of exendin-4 reduced hyperglycemia. The treatment caused significant increases of the insulin contents of the pancreas and islets, and retained the insulin-positive area. Dispersed transgenic islet cells lived only shortly, and several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related molecules such as immunoglobulin-binding protein (Bip), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 a ,X -box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, activating transcription factor-4, and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) were more expressed in the transgenic islets. We also found that the spliced form of XBP-1, a marker of ER stress, was also increased in b-cellspecific calmodulin-overexpressing transgenic islets. In the quantitative real-time PCR analyses, the expression levels of Bip and CHOP were reduced in the islets from the transgenic mice treated with exendin-4.

            "abstract": "There is a progressive deterioration in \u03b2-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. At diagnosis, islet function may be reduced by up to 50% compared with healthy control subjects, and there is also likely to be a reduction in \u03b2-cell mass of up to 60%. The reduction in \u03b2-cell mass is due to accelerated apoptosis. Currently, few pharmacological therapies address this reduction in \u03b2-cell mass and function. This means that patients are generally subjected to an increasing polypharmacy to control their diabetes, with most eventually being treated by insulin. Incretin hormones, which are released from the gastrointestinal tract after a meal, enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreas, aiding the overall regulation of glucose homeostasis in healthy subjects. In addition, these hormones, especially glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, have a number of protective effects on the \u03b2-cells, including a reduction in apoptosis and enhancement of \u03b2-cell proliferation and neogenesis. These benefits are lost to a significant extent in patients with diabetes. The recently developed diabetes therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exenatide and liraglutide, appear to have beneficial effects on \u03b2-cell function and hence offer promise for durable glycemic control as well as potentially reducing the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe clinical course of type 2 diabetes is characterized by a progressive decline in \u03b2-cell mass and function. Although the elevated levels of fasting glucose and impairment of insulin action in peripheral tissues may predate the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia only results after a prolonged period of \u03b2-cell degeneration, a process that may begin as much as 12 years before diagnosis, involving a progressive reduction in functionality and mass (1,2). In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, it was estimated that, at diagnosis, type 2 diabetic patients may have already lost up \u2026",

            "abstract": "Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is currently the most effective treatment of obesity, although limited by availability and operative risk. The gut hormones Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Peptide YY (PYY), and Oxyntomodulin (OXM) are elevated postprandially after RYGB, which has been postulated to contribute to its metabolic benefits. Objective: We hypothesized that infusion of the three gut hormones to achieve levels similar to those encountered postprandially in RYGB patients might be effective in suppressing appetite. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a continuous infusion of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY (GOP) on energy intake and expenditure in obese volunteers. Methods: Obese volunteers were randomized to receive an infusion of GOP or placebo in a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study for 10.5 hours a day. This was delivered subcutaneously using a pump device, allowing volunteers to remain ambulatory. Ad libitum food intake studies were performed during the infusion, and energy expenditure was measured using a ventilated hood calorimeter. Results: Postprandial levels of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY seen post RYGB were successfully matched using 4 pmol/kg/min, 4 pmol/kg/min, and 0.4 pmol/kg/min, respectively. This dose led to a mean reduction of 32% in food intake. No significant effects on resting energy expenditure were observed. Conclusion: This is, to our knowledge, the first time that an acute continuous subcutaneous infusion of GOP, replicating the postprandial levels observed after RYGB, is shown to be safe and effective in reducing food intake. This data suggests that triple hormone therapy might be a useful tool against obesity.",

Subcutaneous infusion of these hormones (\u201cGOP\u201d), mimicking postprandial levels, reduces energy intake. Our objective was to study the effects of GOP on glycemia and body weight when given for 4 weeks to patients with diabetes and obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this single-blinded mechanistic study, obese patients with prediabetes/diabetes were randomized to GOP (n = 15) or saline (n = 11) infusion for 4 weeks. We also studied 21 patients who had undergone RYGB and 22 patients who followed a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) as unblinded comparators. Outcomes measured were 1) body weight, 2) fructosamine levels, 3) glucose and insulin during a mixed meal test (MMT), 4) energy expenditure (EE), 5) energy intake (EI), and 6) mean glucose and measures of glucose variability during continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS GOP infusion was well tolerated over the 4-week period. There was a greater weight loss (P = 0.025) with GOP (mean change \u22124.4 [95% CI \u22125.3, \u22123.5] kg) versus saline (\u22122.5 [\u22124.1, \u22120.9] kg). GOP led to a greater improvement (P = 0.0026) in fructosamine (\u221244.1 [\u221262.7, \u221225.5] \u00b5mol/L) versus saline (\u221211.7 [\u221218.9, \u22124.5] \u00b5mol/L). Despite a smaller weight loss compared with RYGB and VLCD, GOP led to superior glucose tolerance after a mixed-meal stimulus and reduced glycemic variability compared with RYGB and VLCD. CONCLUSIONS GOP infusion improves glycemia and reduces body weight. It achieves superior glucose tolerance and reduced glucose variability compared with RYGB and VLCD. GOP is a viable alternative for the treatment of diabetes with favorable effects on body weight.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) augments postprandial secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin (OXM), and peptide YY (PYY). Subcutaneous infusion of these hormones (\u201cGOP\u201d), mimicking postprandial levels, reduces energy intake. Our objective was to study the effects of GOP on glycemia and body weight when given for 4 weeks to patients with diabetes and obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this single-blinded mechanistic study, obese patients with prediabetes/diabetes were randomized to GOP (n = 15) or saline (n = 11) infusion for 4 weeks. We also studied 21 patients who had undergone RYGB and 22 patients who followed a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) as unblinded comparators. Outcomes measured were 1) body weight, 2) fructosamine levels, 3) glucose and insulin during a mixed meal test (MMT), 4) energy expenditure (EE), 5) energy intake (EI), and 6) mean glucose and measures of glucose variability during continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS GOP infusion was well tolerated over the 4-week period. There was a greater weight loss (P = 0.025) with GOP (mean change \u22124.4 [95% CI \u22125.3, \u22123.5] kg) versus saline (\u22122.5 [\u22124.1, \u22120.9] kg). GOP led to a greater improvement (P = 0.0026) in fructosamine (\u221244.1 [\u221262.7, \u221225.5] \u00b5mol/L) versus saline (\u221211.7 [\u221218.9, \u22124.5] \u00b5mol/L). Despite a smaller weight loss compared with RYGB and VLCD, GOP led to superior glucose tolerance after a mixed-meal stimulus and reduced glycemic variability compared with RYGB and VLCD. CONCLUSIONS GOP infusion improves glycemia and reduces body weight. It achieves superior glucose tolerance and reduced glucose variability compared with RYGB and VLCD. GOP is a viable alternative for the treatment of diabetes with favorable effects on body weight.",

In this study, streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic transgenic GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP and Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mouse models have been used to study effects of sustained NPYR1 activation on islet cell composition and alpha- and beta-cell lineage transitioning. STZ induced a particularly severe form of diabetes in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, but twice-daily administration (25 nmol/kg) of SL-PYY(1-36) for 11 days consistently improved metabolic status. Blood glucose was decreased (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001) and both fasted plasma and pancreatic insulin significantly increased by SL-PYY(1-36). In both GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP and Ins1 Cre/+; Rosa26-eYFP mice, STZ provoked characteristic losses (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001) of islet numbers, beta-cell and pancreatic islet areas together with increases in area and central islet location of alpha-cells. With exception of alpha-cell area, these morphological changes were fully, or partially, returned to non-diabetic control levels by SL-PYY(1-36). Interestingly, STZ apparently triggered decreased (p < 0.001) alpha- to beta-cell transition in GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP mice, together with increased loss of beta-cell identity in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, but both effects were significantly (p < 0.001) reversed by SL-PYY(1-36). SL-PYY(1-36) also apparently reduced (p < 0.05) beta- to alpha-cell conversion in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice and glucagon expressing alpha-cells in GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP mice. These data indicate that islet benefits of prolonged NPY1R activation, and especially restoration of beta-cell mass, are observed irrespective of diabetes status, being linked to cell lineage alterations including transdifferentiation of alpha- to beta-cells.",

            "abstract": "Enzymatically stable and specific neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPYR1) agonists, such as sea lamprey PYY(1-36) (SL-PYY(1-36)), are believed to improve glucose regulation in diabetes by targeting pancreatic islets. In this study, streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic transgenic GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP and Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mouse models have been used to study effects of sustained NPYR1 activation on islet cell composition and alpha- and beta-cell lineage transitioning. STZ induced a particularly severe form of diabetes in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, but twice-daily administration (25 nmol/kg) of SL-PYY(1-36) for 11 days consistently improved metabolic status. Blood glucose was decreased (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001) and both fasted plasma and pancreatic insulin significantly increased by SL-PYY(1-36). In both GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP and Ins1 Cre/+; Rosa26-eYFP mice, STZ provoked characteristic losses (p < 0.05 - p < 0.001) of islet numbers, beta-cell and pancreatic islet areas together with increases in area and central islet location of alpha-cells. With exception of alpha-cell area, these morphological changes were fully, or partially, returned to non-diabetic control levels by SL-PYY(1-36). Interestingly, STZ apparently triggered decreased (p < 0.001) alpha- to beta-cell transition in GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP mice, together with increased loss of beta-cell identity in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, but both effects were significantly (p < 0.001) reversed by SL-PYY(1-36). SL-PYY(1-36) also apparently reduced (p < 0.05) beta- to alpha-cell conversion in Ins1 Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice and glucagon expressing alpha-cells in GluCreERT2 ;ROSA26-eYFP mice. These data indicate that islet benefits of prolonged NPY1R activation, and especially restoration of beta-cell mass, are observed irrespective of diabetes status, being linked to cell lineage alterations including transdifferentiation of alpha- to beta-cells.",
