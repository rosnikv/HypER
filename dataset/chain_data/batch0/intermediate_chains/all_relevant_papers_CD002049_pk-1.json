        "abstract": "Low energy laser photostimulation at certain wavelengths can enhance tissue repair by releasing growth factors from fibroblasts and stimulate the healing process. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of laser photostimulation on collagen production in experimentally tenotomized and repaired rabbit Achilles tendons.",

        "title": "Effect of Gallium Aluminum Arsenide Triple-Diode Laser on Median Nerve Latency in Human Subjects",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous-wave gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) triple-diode laser (830 nm, 90 mW) on median nerve motor and sensory evoked potential latencies. This investigation attempted to determine whether the location of treatment, in an area where the median nerve was either superficial or deep, influenced the effectiveness of the laser treatment. Forty-two healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive 12 J of GaAlAs laser treatment or placebo laser treatment at a single point on the wrist or forearm. The results of this study indicated no difference between the pre- or posttreatment latency measurements in either the placebo laser or the GaAlAs laser group. Motor and sensory latencies varied significantly by location of treatment, but there was no significant interaction between laser treatment group and location. GaAlAs triple-diode laser treatment did not significantly affect median nerve motor or sensory latency.",
