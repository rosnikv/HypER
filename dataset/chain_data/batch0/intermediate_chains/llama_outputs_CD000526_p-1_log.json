            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of adjunctive prednisolone on morbidity, pericardial fluid resolution, and mortality in HIV seropositive patients with effusive tuberculous pericarditis. DESIGN Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial. SETTING Two medical school affiliated referral hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. PATIENTS 58 HIV seropositive patients aged 18\u201355 years with tuberculous pericarditis. INTERVENTIONS All patients received standard short course antituberculous chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to receive prednisolone or placebo for six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical improvement, echocardiographic and radiologic pericardial fluid resolution, and death. RESULTS 29 patients were assigned to prednisolone and 29 to placebo. After 18 months of follow up there were five deaths in the prednisolone treated group and 10 deaths in the placebo group. Mortality was significantly lower in the prednisolone group (log rank \u03c72\u2009=\u20098.19, df\u2009=\u20091, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Resolution of raised jugular venous pressure (p\u2009=\u20090.017), hepatomegaly (p\u2009=\u20090.007), and ascites (p\u2009=\u20090.015), and improvement in physical activity (p\u2009=\u20090.02), were significantly more rapid in the prednisolone treated patients. However, there was no difference in the rate of radiologic and echocardiographic resolution of pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive prednisolone for effusive tuberculous pericarditis produced a pronounced reduction in mortality. It is suggested prednisolone should be added to standard short course chemotherapy to treat HIV related effusive tuberculous pericarditis.",

The diagnostic strategy and optimal therapy for TB pericarditis are not well established. We retrospectively analyzed the diagnostic data, clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome in a total of 19 patients with TB pericarditis treated from January 1988 to July 2002. Based on the finding of echocardiography, 8 of these patients were classified as having early stage and 11 as having advanced-stage disease. There were 15 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 65 years (range, 34 to 80 years). All patients received antituberculosis chemotherapy, and all but 2 underwent at least 1 of the following procedures: pericardiocentesis and biopsy, pericardial window placement, and pericardiectomy. None of the patients received corticosteroids concurrently. Of the 8 patients with early-stage TB pericarditis, 3 (37.5%) developed constrictive pericarditis, while of the 7 patients with advanced-stage disease (excluding 4 who had already developed TB constrictive pericarditis at diagnosis), 6 (85.7%) subsequently developed constriction. These findings underscore the importance of pericardiectomy in patients with advanced-stage TB pericarditis. To avoid potentially lethal cardiac tamponade and constrictive cardiomyopathy, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of TB pericarditis when encountering a patient with pericardial effusion. Histopathologic study of pericardial tissue sample is the key to timely diagnosis of TB pericarditis. The favorable outcomes of patients in this series suggest that a combination of antituberculosis chemotherapy and timely pericardiectomy may be the optimal therapy for patients with TB pericarditis.",

A 77-year-old man suffered from exertional dyspnea for 3 weeks. He had received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with stent for left anterior descending artery lesion 3 weeks prior to this admission. As dyspnea on exertion persisted, he was admitted to our hospital for possible coronary arterial bypass grafting. No significant in-stent restenosis was found during recatheterization. Meanwhile, bilateral pleural effusions were found, but they were negative for TB cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thickening of pericardium with large amount of pericardial effusion was noted during echocardiographic examination 3 weeks after admission. Emergent pericardiotomy was done for cardiac tamponade and biopsy. Acute primary TB pericarditis was diagnosed and antituberculous chemotherapy plus adjuvant corticosteroid treatment were given. The patient was discharged 2 weeks later in fair condition. Unfortunately, one month later he was readmitted due to constrictive pericarditis. Pericardiectomy was done. After a full course of anti-TB therapy for 9 months, the patient kept well after follow-up for one year.",

            "abstract": "Acute primary tuberculous (TB) pericarditis is a rare but life-threatening condition. It may lead to diastolic heart failure in constrictive pericarditis. A 77-year-old man suffered from exertional dyspnea for 3 weeks. He had received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with stent for left anterior descending artery lesion 3 weeks prior to this admission. As dyspnea on exertion persisted, he was admitted to our hospital for possible coronary arterial bypass grafting. No significant in-stent restenosis was found during recatheterization. Meanwhile, bilateral pleural effusions were found, but they were negative for TB cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thickening of pericardium with large amount of pericardial effusion was noted during echocardiographic examination 3 weeks after admission. Emergent pericardiotomy was done for cardiac tamponade and biopsy. Acute primary TB pericarditis was diagnosed and antituberculous chemotherapy plus adjuvant corticosteroid treatment were given. The patient was discharged 2 weeks later in fair condition. Unfortunately, one month later he was readmitted due to constrictive pericarditis. Pericardiectomy was done. After a full course of anti-TB therapy for 9 months, the patient kept well after follow-up for one year.",
