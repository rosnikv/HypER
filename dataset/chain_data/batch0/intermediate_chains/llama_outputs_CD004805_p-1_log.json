            "abstract": "High-potassium diets have been shown to be beneficial in cardiovascular disease partly because of a blood pressure-lowering effect. The effect of potassium on inflammation has not been studied. We investigated the influence of potassium supplementation on the degree of renal inflammation and the intracellular signaling mechanisms that could mediate inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD was created in male Sprague-Dawley rats by subtotal nephrectomy. Two groups of CKD rats were pair fed with diets containing 2.1% potassium (potassium-supplemented diet) or 0.4% potassium (basal diet). Body weight, blood pressure, and blood and urine electrolytes were measured biweekly. The animals were euthanized at week 8, and the remnant kidneys were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR. In the CKD pair-fed groups, blood potassium concentration did not differ significantly, but blood pressure was lower in the potassium-supplemented group. Compared with the basal diet, potassium supplementation decreased renal tubulointerstitial injury and suppressed renal inflammation as evidenced by decreased macrophage infiltration, lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased NF-kappaB activation. These renoprotective effects were associated with downregulation of renal transforming growth facto-beta, upregulation of renal Smad7, and lower blood pressure. Our results show that potassium supplementation can reduce renal inflammation and hence, could modulate the progression of kidney injury in CKD.",

            "abstract": "Background/Aims: Abnormal serum potassium is associated with higher mortality in dialysis patients, but its impact on outcomes in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear. Furthermore, blacks with normal kidney function have lower urinary potassium excretion, but it is unclear if such differences have a bearing on race-associated outcomes in CKD. Methods: We studied predialysis mortality and slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) associated with serum potassium in 1,227 males with CKD. Mortality was examined in time-dependent Cox models, and slopes of eGFR in linear mixed effects models with adjustments for case mix and laboratory values. Results: Both hypo- and hyperkalemia were associated with mortality overall and in 933 white patients, but in 294 blacks hypokalemia was a stronger death predictor. Hypokalemia was associated with loss of kidney function independent of race: a 1 mEq/l lower potassium was associated with an adjusted difference in slopes of eGFR of -0.13 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (95% CI: -0.20 to -0.07), p < 0.001. Conclusion: Hypo- and hyperkalemia are associated with higher mortality in CKD patients. Blacks appear to better tolerate higher potassium than whites. Hypokalemia is associated with faster CKD progression independent of race. Hyperkalemia management may warrant race-specific consideration, and hypokalemia correction may slow CKD progression.

Moreover, the reasons for the potential prognostic value of hypokalemia have not been elucidated. Design, Participants & Measurements 2500 participants with CKD stage 1\u20134 in the Integrated CKD care program Kaohsiung for delaying Dialysis (ICKD) prospective observational study were analyzed and followed up for 2.7 years. Generalized additive model was fitted to determine the cutpoints and the U-shape association between sK and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). sK was classified into five groups with the cutpoints of 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 mEq/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models predicting the outcomes were used. Results The mean age was 62.4 years, mean sK level was 4.2\u00b10.5 mEq/L and average eGFR was 40.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Female vs male, diuretic use vs. non-use, hypertension, higher eGFR, bicarbonate, CRP and hemoglobin levels significantly correlated with hypokalemia. In patients with lower sK, nephrotic range proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia were more prevalent but the use of RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors was less frequent. Hypokalemia was significantly associated with ESRD with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.03\u20133.22) in sK <3.5mEq/L and 1.67 (95% CI,1.19\u20132.35) in sK\u200a=\u200a3.5\u20134 mEq/L, respectively, compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia defined as sK >5 mEq/L conferred 1.6-fold (95% CI,1.09\u20132.34) increased risk of ESRD compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hypokalemia was also associated with rapid decline of renal function defined as eGFR slope below 20% of the distribution range. Conclusion In conclusion, both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with increased risk of ESRD in CKD population. Hypokalemia is related to increased use of diuretics, decreased use of RAS blockade and malnutrition, all of which may impose additive deleterious effects on renal outcomes.",

Generalized additive model was fitted to determine the cutpoints and the U-shape association between sK and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). sK was classified into five groups with the cutpoints of 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 mEq/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models predicting the outcomes were used. Results The mean age was 62.4 years, mean sK level was 4.2\u00b10.5 mEq/L and average eGFR was 40.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Female vs male, diuretic use vs. non-use, hypertension, higher eGFR, bicarbonate, CRP and hemoglobin levels significantly correlated with hypokalemia. In patients with lower sK, nephrotic range proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia were more prevalent but the use of RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors was less frequent. Hypokalemia was significantly associated with ESRD with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.03\u20133.22) in sK <3.5mEq/L and 1.67 (95% CI,1.19\u20132.35) in sK\u200a=\u200a3.5\u20134 mEq/L, respectively, compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia defined as sK >5 mEq/L conferred 1.6-fold (95% CI,1.09\u20132.34) increased risk of ESRD compared with sK\u200a=\u200a4.5\u20135 mEq/L. Hypokalemia was also associated with rapid decline of renal function defined as eGFR slope below 20% of the distribution range. Conclusion In conclusion, both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with increased risk of ESRD in CKD population. Hypokalemia is related to increased use of diuretics, decreased use of RAS blockade and malnutrition, all of which may impose additive deleterious effects on renal outcomes.",

Aside from severe hyperkalemia, the clinical significance of K(+) abnormalities is not known. We sought to examine the association of serum K(+) with mortality and hospitalization rates within narrow eGFR strata to understand how the burden of hyperkalemia varies by CKD severity. Associations were examined between serum K(+) and discontinuation of medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which are known to increase serum K(+).\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nA cohort of patients with CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) with serum K(+) data were studied (n=55,266) between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013 (study end). Serum K(+), eGFR, and covariates were considered on a time-updated basis. Mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers were considered per time at risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the study, serum K(+) levels of 5.5-5.9 and \u22656.0 mEq/L were most prevalent at lower eGFR: they were present, respectively, in 1.7% and 0.2% of patient-time for eGFR of 50-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) versus 7.6% and 1.8% of patient-time for eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Serum K(+) level <3.5 mEq/L was present in 1.2%-1.4% of patient-time across eGFR strata. The median follow-up time was 2.76 years.

Within eGFR strata, there were U-shaped associations of serum K(+) with rates of MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth hyperkalemia and hypokalemia were independently associated with higher rates of death, MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis.

Aside from severe hyperkalemia, the clinical significance of K(+) abnormalities is not known. We sought to examine the association of serum K(+) with mortality and hospitalization rates within narrow eGFR strata to understand how the burden of hyperkalemia varies by CKD severity. Associations were examined between serum K(+) and discontinuation of medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which are known to increase serum K(+).\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nA cohort of patients with CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) with serum K(+) data were studied (n=55,266) between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013 (study end). Serum K(+), eGFR, and covariates were considered on a time-updated basis. Mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers were considered per time at risk.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the study, serum K(+) levels of 5.5-5.9 and \u22656.0 mEq/L were most prevalent at lower eGFR: they were present, respectively, in 1.7% and 0.2% of patient-time for eGFR of 50-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) versus 7.6% and 1.8% of patient-time for eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Serum K(+) level <3.5 mEq/L was present in 1.2%-1.4% of patient-time across eGFR strata. The median follow-up time was 2.76 years. There was a U-shaped association between serum K(+) and mortality; pooled adjusted incidence rate ratios were 3.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.53 to 3.68) and 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 2.52 to 4.34) for K(+) levels <3.5 mEq/L and \u22656.0 mEq/L, respectively. Within eGFR strata, there were U-shaped associations of serum K(+) with rates of MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth hyperkalemia and hypokalemia were independently associated with higher rates of death, MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis.

We quantified hyperkalemia monitoring and risks after ACE\u2010I/ARB initiation and developed and validated a hyperkalemia susceptibility score. Methods and Results We evaluated 69 426 new users of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy in the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project with medication initiation from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010, and follow\u2010up for 1 year thereafter. Three fourths (76%) of SCREAM patients had potassium checked within the first year. Potassium >5 and >5.5 mmol/L occurred in 5.6% and 1.7%, respectively. As a comparison, we propensity\u2010matched new ACE\u2010I/ARB users to 20 186 new \u03b2\u2010blocker users in SCREAM: 64% had potassium checked. The occurrence of elevated potassium levels was similar between new \u03b2\u2010blocker and ACE\u2010I/ARB users without kidney disease; only at estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 were risks higher among ACE\u2010I/ARB users. We developed a hyperkalemia susceptibility score that incorporated estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline potassium level, sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the concomitant use of potassium\u2010sparing diuretics in new ACE\u2010I/ARB users; this score accurately predicted 1\u2010year hyperkalemia risk in the SCREAM cohort (area under the curve, 0.845, 95% CI: 0.840\u20130.869) and in a validation cohort from the US\u2010based Geisinger Health System (N=19 524; area under the curve, 0.818, 95% CI: 0.794\u20130.841), with good calibration. Conclusions Hyperkalemia within the first year of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy was relatively uncommon among people with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, but rates were much higher with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. Use of the hyperkalemia susceptibility score may help guide laboratory monitoring and prescribing strategies.",

We quantified hyperkalemia monitoring and risks after ACE\u2010I/ARB initiation and developed and validated a hyperkalemia susceptibility score. Methods and Results We evaluated 69 426 new users of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy in the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project with medication initiation from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010, and follow\u2010up for 1 year thereafter. Three fourths (76%) of SCREAM patients had potassium checked within the first year. Potassium >5 and >5.5 mmol/L occurred in 5.6% and 1.7%, respectively. As a comparison, we propensity\u2010matched new ACE\u2010I/ARB users to 20 186 new \u03b2\u2010blocker users in SCREAM: 64% had potassium checked. The occurrence of elevated potassium levels was similar between new \u03b2\u2010blocker and ACE\u2010I/ARB users without kidney disease; only at estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 were risks higher among ACE\u2010I/ARB users. We developed a hyperkalemia susceptibility score that incorporated estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline potassium level, sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the concomitant use of potassium\u2010sparing diuretics in new ACE\u2010I/ARB users; this score accurately predicted 1\u2010year hyperkalemia risk in the SCREAM cohort (area under the curve, 0.845, 95% CI: 0.840\u20130.869) and in a validation cohort from the US\u2010based Geisinger Health System (N=19 524; area under the curve, 0.818, 95% CI: 0.794\u20130.841), with good calibration. Conclusions Hyperkalemia within the first year of ACE\u2010I/ARB therapy was relatively uncommon among people with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, but rates were much higher with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. Use of the hyperkalemia susceptibility score may help guide laboratory monitoring and prescribing strategies.",

This population-based cohort study sought to assess the incidence of clinically significant hyperkalemia among adult CKD patients who were prescribed a RAASi and the proportion of patients with RAASi medication change after experiencing incident hyperkalemia. We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study (1 January 2013\u201330 June 2017) using Australian national general practice data from the NPS MedicineWise\u2019s MedicineInsight program. The study included adults aged \u226518 years who received \u22651 RAASi prescription during the study period and had CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73m2).

In patients with CKD, sodium\u2012glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors provide cardiorenal protection, but whether they affect the risk of hyperkalaemia remains uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe CREDENCE trial randomized 4401 participants with T2DM and CKD to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or matching placebo. In this post hoc analysis using an intention-to-treat approach, we assessed the effect of canagliflozin on a composite outcome of time to either investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or the initiation of potassium binders. We also analysed effects on central laboratory-determined hyper- and hypokalaemia (serum potassium \u22656.0 and <3.5\u2009mmol/L, respectively) and change in serum potassium. At baseline, the mean serum potassium in canagliflozin and placebo arms was 4.5\u2009mmol/L; 4395 (99.9%) participants were receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade. The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo [occurring in 32.7 vs. 41.9 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95, P\u2009=\u20090.014]. Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P\u2009=\u20090.031), with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.20, P\u2009=\u20090.53). The mean serum potassium over time with canagliflozin was similar to that of placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.",

In patients with CKD, sodium\u2012glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors provide cardiorenal protection, but whether they affect the risk of hyperkalaemia remains uncertain.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe CREDENCE trial randomized 4401 participants with T2DM and CKD to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or matching placebo. In this post hoc analysis using an intention-to-treat approach, we assessed the effect of canagliflozin on a composite outcome of time to either investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or the initiation of potassium binders. We also analysed effects on central laboratory-determined hyper- and hypokalaemia (serum potassium \u22656.0 and <3.5\u2009mmol/L, respectively) and change in serum potassium. At baseline, the mean serum potassium in canagliflozin and placebo arms was 4.5\u2009mmol/L; 4395 (99.9%) participants were receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade. The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo [occurring in 32.7 vs. 41.9 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95, P\u2009=\u20090.014]. Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P\u2009=\u20090.031), with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.20, P\u2009=\u20090.53). The mean serum potassium over time with canagliflozin was similar to that of placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.",

Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P\u2009=\u20090.031), with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.20, P\u2009=\u20090.53). The mean serum potassium over time with canagliflozin was similar to that of placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.",

            "abstract": "Background: Hyperkalemia increases risk of cardiac arrhythmias and death and limits the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which improve clinical outcomes in people with chronic kidney disease or systolic heart failure. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiorenal events in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease. However, their effect on hyperkalemia has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease in whom serum potassium levels were routinely measured. The primary outcome was time to serious hyperkalemia, defined as central laboratory\u2013determined serum potassium \u22656.0 mmol/L, with other outcomes including investigator-reported hyperkalemia events and hypokalemia (serum potassium \u22643.5 mmol/L). Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate treatment effects from each trial with hazards ratios and corresponding 95% CIs pooled with random-effects models to obtain summary treatment effects, overall and across key subgroups. Results: Results from 6 trials were included comprising 49\u2009875 participants assessing 4 SGLT2 inhibitors. Of these, 1754 participants developed serious hyperkalemia, and an additional 1119 investigator-reported hyperkalemia events were recorded. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of serious hyperkalemia (hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76\u20130.93]), an effect consistent across studies (Pheterogeneity=0.71). The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalemia was also lower with SGLT2 inhibitors (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68\u20130.93]; Pheterogeneity=0.21). Reductions in serious hyperkalemia were observed across a range of subgroups, including baseline kidney function, history of heart failure, and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor, diuretic, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94\u20131.15]; Pheterogeneity=0.42). Conclusions: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of serious hyperkalemia in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease without increasing the risk of hypokalemia.",

SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94\u20131.15]; Pheterogeneity=0.42). Conclusions: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of serious hyperkalemia in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease without increasing the risk of hypokalemia.",

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiorenal events in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease. However, their effect on hyperkalemia has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease in whom serum potassium levels were routinely measured. The primary outcome was time to serious hyperkalemia, defined as central laboratory\u2013determined serum potassium \u22656.0 mmol/L, with other outcomes including investigator-reported hyperkalemia events and hypokalemia (serum potassium \u22643.5 mmol/L). Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate treatment effects from each trial with hazards ratios and corresponding 95% CIs pooled with random-effects models to obtain summary treatment effects, overall and across key subgroups. Results: Results from 6 trials were included comprising 49\u2009875 participants assessing 4 SGLT2 inhibitors. Of these, 1754 participants developed serious hyperkalemia, and an additional 1119 investigator-reported hyperkalemia events were recorded. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of serious hyperkalemia (hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76\u20130.93]), an effect consistent across studies (Pheterogeneity=0.71).

            "abstract": "Background: Hyperkalemia increases risk of cardiac arrhythmias and death and limits the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which improve clinical outcomes in people with chronic kidney disease or systolic heart failure. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiorenal events in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease. However, their effect on hyperkalemia has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease in whom serum potassium levels were routinely measured. The primary outcome was time to serious hyperkalemia, defined as central laboratory\u2013determined serum potassium \u22656.0 mmol/L, with other outcomes including investigator-reported hyperkalemia events and hypokalemia (serum potassium \u22643.5 mmol/L). Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate treatment effects from each trial with hazards ratios and corresponding 95% CIs pooled with random-effects models to obtain summary treatment effects, overall and across key subgroups. Results: Results from 6 trials were included comprising 49\u2009875 participants assessing 4 SGLT2 inhibitors. Of these, 1754 participants developed serious hyperkalemia, and an additional 1119 investigator-reported hyperkalemia events were recorded. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of serious hyperkalemia (hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76\u20130.93]), an effect consistent across studies (Pheterogeneity=0.71). The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalemia was also lower with SGLT2 inhibitors (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68\u20130.93]; Pheterogeneity=0.21). Reductions in serious hyperkalemia were observed across a range of subgroups, including baseline kidney function, history of heart failure, and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor, diuretic, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94\u20131.15]; Pheterogeneity=0.42). Conclusions: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of serious hyperkalemia in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk or with chronic kidney disease without increasing the risk of hypokalemia.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) finerenone all individually reduce cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria. However, the lifetime benefits of combination therapy with these medicines are not known. METHODS: We used data from 2 SGLT2i trials (CANVAS [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment] and CREDENCE [Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation]), 2 ns-MRA trials (FIDELIO-DKD [Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease] and FIGARO-DKD [Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Clinical Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease]), and 8 GLP-1 RA trials to estimate the relative effects of combination therapy versus conventional care (renin-angiotensin system blockade and traditional risk factor control) on cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes. Using actuarial methods, we then estimated absolute risk reductions with combination SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio \u226530 mg/g) by applying estimated combination treatment effects to participants receiving conventional care in CANVAS and CREDENCE. RESULTS: Compared with conventional care, the combination of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.55\u20130.76) for major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death). The corresponding estimated absolute risk reduction over 3 years was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.0\u20135.7), with a number needed to treat of 23 (95% CI, 18\u201333). For a 50-year-old patient commencing combination therapy, estimated major adverse cardiovascular event\u2013free survival was 21.1 years compared with 17.9 years for conventional care (3.2 years gained [95% CI, 2.1\u20134.3]). There were also projected gains in survival free from hospitalized heart failure (3.2 years [95% CI, 2.4\u20134.0]), chronic kidney disease progression (5.5 years [95% CI, 4.0\u20136.7]), cardiovascular death (2.2 years [95% CI, 1.2\u20133.0]), and all-cause death (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.4\u20133.4]). Attenuated but clinically relevant gains in event-free survival were observed in analyses assuming 50% additive effects of combination therapy, including for major adverse cardiovascular events (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.1\u20133.5]), chronic kidney disease progression (4.5 years [95% CI, 2.8\u20135.9]), and all-cause death (1.8 years [95% CI, 0.7\u20132.8]). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria, combination treatment of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA has the potential to afford relevant gains in cardiovascular and kidney event-free and overall survival.",
