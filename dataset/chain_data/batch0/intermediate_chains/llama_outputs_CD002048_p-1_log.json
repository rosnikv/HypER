            "abstract": "The efficacy, toxicity and possible steroid-sparing properties of auranofin in the treatment of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) were studied in a 2 yr prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty-five patients with onset of arthritis after the age of 60 yr were randomized to either auranofin 3 mg b.i.d. [n = 31, age 70 (61-84) yr, median (range)] or placebo tablets [n = 34, age 72 (60-81) yr]. Oral prednisolone, starting dose 7.5 or 20 mg daily, was used as a rescue drug in patients with intolerable joint pain and stiffness and with C-reactive protein (CRP) > or = 20 mg/l, and was tapered down according to protocol guidelines. Patients receiving auranofin continued therapy for a longer period of time (55% completers) than those on placebo medication (18% completers). The auranofin group consumed significantly less prednisolone, 2.64 (0-11.85) mg/day [median (range)], compared to 5.0 (0-18.33) mg/day in the placebo group (P = 0.006). No group differences at 2 yr follow-up were found for changes in joint pain (P = 0.49), number of swollen joints (P = 0.61), Health Assessment Questionnaire score (P = 0.18) and radiographic damage score (Larsen-Dale index) of the hands (P = 0.84). Within-group changes in radiographic scores were also insignificant. The drop-out rate due to adverse events was surprisingly higher in the placebo group (41%) than in the auranofin group (10%) and, as expected, higher due to lack of effect (29 and 16%). The results indicate that auranofin is safe, superior to placebo and has steroid-sparing capacity in the treatment of EORA. The favourable radiographic outcome in both groups needs confirmation in future studies.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA) trial demonstrated that step-down combination therapy with prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (SSZ) was superior to SSZ monotherapy for suppressing disease activity and radiologic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study was conducted to investigate whether the benefits of COBRA therapy were sustained over time, and to determine which baseline factors could predict outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients had participated in the 56-week COBRA trial. During followup, they were seen by their own rheumatologists and were also assessed regularly by study nurses; no treatment protocol was specified. Disease activity, radiologic damage, and functional ability were the primary outcome domains. Two independent assessors scored radiographs in sequence according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method. Outcomes were analyzed by generalized estimating equations on the basis of intent-to-treat, starting with data obtained at the last visit of the COBRA trial (56 weeks after baseline).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the beginning of followup, patients in the COBRA group had a significantly lower mean time-averaged 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) and a significantly lower median radiologic damage (Sharp) score compared with those in the SSZ monotherapy group. The functional ability score (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) was similar in both groups. During the 4-5 year followup period, the time-averaged DAS28 decreased 0.17 points per year in the SSZ group and 0.07 in the COBRA group. The Sharp progression rate was 8.6 points per year in the SSZ group and 5.6 in the COBRA group. After adjustment for differences in treatment and disease activity during followup, the between-group difference in the rate of radiologic progression was 3.7 points per year. The HAQ score did not change significantly over time. Independent baseline predictors of radiologic progression over time (apart from treatment allocation) were rheumatoid factor positivity, Sharp score, and DAS28.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn initial 6-month cycle of intensive combination treatment that includes high-dose corticosteroids results in sustained suppression of the rate of radiologic progression in patients with early RA, independent of subsequent antirheumatic therapy.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA) trial demonstrated that step-down combination therapy with prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (SSZ) was superior to SSZ monotherapy for suppressing disease activity and radiologic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study was conducted to investigate whether the benefits of COBRA therapy were sustained over time, and to determine which baseline factors could predict outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients had participated in the 56-week COBRA trial. During followup, they were seen by their own rheumatologists and were also assessed regularly by study nurses; no treatment protocol was specified. Disease activity, radiologic damage, and functional ability were the primary outcome domains. Two independent assessors scored radiographs in sequence according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method. Outcomes were analyzed by generalized estimating equations on the basis of intent-to-treat, starting with data obtained at the last visit of the COBRA trial (56 weeks after baseline).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the beginning of followup, patients in the COBRA group had a significantly lower mean time-averaged 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) and a significantly lower median radiologic damage (Sharp) score compared with those in the SSZ monotherapy group. The functional ability score (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) was similar in both groups. During the 4-5 year followup period, the time-averaged DAS28 decreased 0.17 points per year in the SSZ group and 0.07 in the COBRA group. The Sharp progression rate was 8.6 points per year in the SSZ group and 5.6 in the COBRA group. After adjustment for differences in treatment and disease activity during followup, the between-group difference in the rate of radiologic progression was 3.7 points per year. The HAQ score did not change significantly over time. Independent baseline predictors of radiologic progression over time (apart from treatment allocation) were rheumatoid factor positivity, Sharp score, and DAS28.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn initial 6-month cycle of intensive combination treatment that includes high-dose corticosteroids results in sustained suppression of the rate of radiologic progression in patients with early RA, independent of subsequent antirheumatic therapy.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA) trial demonstrated that step-down combination therapy with prednisolone, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (SSZ) was superior to SSZ monotherapy for suppressing disease activity and radiologic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study was conducted to investigate whether the benefits of COBRA therapy were sustained over time, and to determine which baseline factors could predict outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients had participated in the 56-week COBRA trial. During followup, they were seen by their own rheumatologists and were also assessed regularly by study nurses; no treatment protocol was specified. Disease activity, radiologic damage, and functional ability were the primary outcome domains. Two independent assessors scored radiographs in sequence according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method. Outcomes were analyzed by generalized estimating equations on the basis of intent-to-treat, starting with data obtained at the last visit of the COBRA trial (56 weeks after baseline).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the beginning of followup, patients in the COBRA group had a significantly lower mean time-averaged 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) and a significantly lower median radiologic damage (Sharp) score compared with those in the SSZ monotherapy group. The functional ability score (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) was similar in both groups. During the 4-5 year followup period, the time-averaged DAS28 decreased 0.17 points per year in the SSZ group and 0.07 in the COBRA group. The Sharp progression rate was 8.6 points per year in the SSZ group and 5.6 in the COBRA group. After adjustment for differences in treatment and disease activity during followup, the between-group difference in the rate of radiologic progression was 3.7 points per year. The HAQ score did not change significantly over time. Independent baseline predictors of radiologic progression over time (apart from treatment allocation) were rheumatoid factor positivity, Sharp score, and DAS28.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn initial 6-month cycle of intensive combination treatment that includes high-dose corticosteroids results in sustained suppression of the rate of radiologic progression in patients with early RA, independent of subsequent antirheumatic therapy.",

After 2 years, the DMARD and prednisolone treatments became unrestricted, but were still targeted toward remission. The long-term effectiveness was assessed by recording the frequency of remissions and the extent of joint damage seen on radiographs of the hands and feet obtained annually up to 5 years.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the long-term frequency of disease remissions and the progression of joint damage in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were initially randomized to 2 years of treatment with either a combination of 3 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or a single DMARD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter prospective followup study, a cohort of 195 patients with early, clinically active RA was randomly assigned to treatment with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone or with a single DMARD (initially, sulfasalazine) with or without prednisolone. After 2 years, the DMARD and prednisolone treatments became unrestricted, but were still targeted toward remission. The long-term effectiveness was assessed by recording the frequency of remissions and the extent of joint damage seen on radiographs of the hands and feet obtained annually up to 5 years. Radiographs were assessed by the Larsen score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 160 patients (78 in the combination group and 82 in the single group) completed the 5-year extension study. At 2 years, 40% of the patients in the combination-DMARD group and 18% in the single-DMARD group had achieved remission (P < 0.009). At 5 years, the corresponding percentages were 28% and 22% (P not significant). The median Larsen radiologic damage scores at baseline, 2 years, and 5 years in the combination-DMARD and single-DMARD groups were 0 and 2 (P = 0.50), 4 and 12 (P = 0.005), and 11 and 24 (P = 0.001), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAggressive initial treatment of early RA with the combination of 3 DMARDs for the first 2 years limits the peripheral joint damage for at least 5 years. Our results confirm the earlier concept that triple therapy with combinations of DMARDs contributes to an improved long-term radiologic outcome in patients with early and clinically active RA.",

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that modern joint imaging improves the accuracy of remission measurement in RA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 107 RA patients receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy who were judged by their consultant rheumatologist to be in remission and 17 normal control subjects.

The Disease Activity Score 28-joint assessment and the American College of Rheumatology remission criteria, together with strict clinical definitions of remission, were applied.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that modern joint imaging improves the accuracy of remission measurement in RA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied 107 RA patients receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy who were judged by their consultant rheumatologist to be in remission and 17 normal control subjects. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, functional, and quality of life assessments. The Disease Activity Score 28-joint assessment and the American College of Rheumatology remission criteria, together with strict clinical definitions of remission, were applied. Imaging of the hands and wrists using standardized acquisition and scoring techniques with conventional 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US) were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIrrespective of which clinical criteria were applied to determine remission, the majority of patients continued to have evidence of active inflammation, as shown by findings on the imaging assessments. Even in asymptomatic patients with clinically normal joints, MRI showed that 96% had synovitis and 46% had bone marrow edema, and US showed that 73% had gray-scale synovial hypertrophy and 43% had increased power Doppler signal. Only mild synovial thickening was seen in 3 of the control subjects (18%), but no bone marrow edema.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost RA patients who satisfied the remission criteria with normal findings on clinical and laboratory studies had imaging-detected synovitis. This subclinical inflammation may explain the observed discrepancy between disease activity and outcome in RA. Imaging assessment may be necessary for the accurate evaluation of disease status and, in particular, for the definition of true remission.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a systematic musculoskeletal ultrasonographic (US) assessment in the detection of residual disease activity in patients with early RA who achieved clinical remission.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe prospectively studied 106 early RA patients receiving conventional DMARDs according to a disease activity score (DAS)-steered therapeutic protocol over a 24-month period. Standard evaluation included clinical, laboratory, functional and systematic (44 joints) US assessment. US indexes of grey scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) synovitis were correlated with clinical evaluation, laboratory indexes and clinical outcome. Clinical remission was defined when DAS was <1.6 at two consecutive visits 3 months apart.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUS examination was significantly more sensitive than clinical examination, both in active disease and in remission. In patients with an active disease, both clinical and US indexes correlated with CRP, whereas in remission only PD still remained significantly correlated. In clinical remission, 95% of the patients showed residual GS synovitis, and 41% of them showed a positive PD signal. Positive PD signal, even in a single joint, resulted the main predictor of relapse within 6 months, both in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a cohort of early RA patients treated with conventional DMARDs, US-GS can detect residual disease activity more sensitively than clinical examination both in active disease and in remission. Moreover, PD-positive synovial hypertrophy identifies an ongoing inflammation even during remission and predicts short-term relapse.",

The aims of this study were to define: (1) how many patients reached ultrasound power Doppler (US-PD) remission in a cohort of patients with early RA (ERA) compared with longstanding RA (LSRA); (2) possible predictors of US-PD remission; and (3) how many patients with and without US-PD remission relapsed after 1 year of follow-up in ERA and LSRA. Methods 48 patients with ERA and 46 with LSRA with disease activity score <1.6 underwent US assessment. Six hand and wrist joints were studied for active synovitis. 56.2% of patients with ERA and 50.0% of those with LSRA fulfilled American College of Rheumatology (ACR) remission criteria. Results 43.7% of patients with ERA and 17.4% of those with LSRA had no evidence of synovitis at US evaluation. Using a stricter clinical definition of remission (ie, ACR criteria), US evaluation confirmed clinical remission in 66.7% of patients with ERA and 26.1% of those with LSRA. Early disease was predictive of clinical US remission. 20.0% of patients with RA who had a negative PD signal at the US evaluation had a flare during the 12-month follow-up period compared with 47.1% of patients who had a positive PD signal. Conclusion US-PD remission occurs in half of patients with ERA and in a minority of patients with LSRA in clinical remission. Early disease seems to be the major determinant of full remission.",

Six hand and wrist joints were studied for active synovitis. 56.2% of patients with ERA and 50.0% of those with LSRA fulfilled American College of Rheumatology (ACR) remission criteria. Results 43.7% of patients with ERA and 17.4% of those with LSRA had no evidence of synovitis at US evaluation. Using a stricter clinical definition of remission (ie, ACR criteria), US evaluation confirmed clinical remission in 66.7% of patients with ERA and 26.1% of those with LSRA. Early disease was predictive of clinical US remission. 20.0% of patients with RA who had a negative PD signal at the US evaluation had a flare during the 12-month follow-up period compared with 47.1% of patients who had a positive PD signal. Conclusion US-PD remission occurs in half of patients with ERA and in a minority of patients with LSRA in clinical remission. Early disease seems to be the major determinant of full remission.",

Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and comprehensive ultrasonographic assessments at baseline and received routine management from expert rheumatologists who were blinded to the ultrasound findings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSensitivity and specificity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria using different definitions of synovitis to identify patients who developed a disease requiring methotrexate (MTX) treatment within 1 year were 58.5% and 79.4%, respectively, for clinical synovitis (tenderness or swelling), 78.0% and 79.4%, respectively, for ultrasound-detected synovitis with a gray-scale (GS) imaging score\u22651 (GS\u22651 ultrasound synovitis), and 56.1% and 93.7%, respectively, for GS\u22652 ultrasound synovitis or a synovial power Doppler (PD) signal score\u22651 (GS\u22652/PD\u22651 ultrasound synovitis).

Objectives To update the existing MSUS guidelines in rheumatology as well as to extend their scope to other anatomic structures relevant for rheumatology. Methods The project consisted of the following steps: (1) a systematic literature review of MSUS evaluable structures; (2) a Delphi survey among rheumatologist and radiologist experts in MSUS to select MS and non-MS anatomic structures evaluable by US that are relevant to rheumatology, to select abnormalities evaluable by US and to prioritise these pathologies for rheumatology and (3) a nominal group technique to achieve consensus on the US scanning procedures and to produce an electronic illustrated manual (ie, App of these procedures). Results Structures from nine MS and non-MS areas (ie, shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand, hip, knee, ankle and foot, peripheral nerves, salivary glands and vessels) were selected for MSUS in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and their detailed scanning procedures (ie, patient position, probe placement, scanning method and bony/other landmarks) were used to produce the App. In addition, US evaluable abnormalities present in RMD for each anatomic structure and their relevance for rheumatology were agreed on by the MSUS experts.

Methods A web-based exercise and subsequent patient-based exercise were carried out. A panel of 30 OMERACT members, participated at the web-based exercise by evaluating twice a set of US images for the presence/absence of CPPD. Afterwards, 19 members of the panel met in Siena, Italy, for the patient-based exercise. During the exercise, all sonographers examined twice eight patients for the presence/absence of CPPD at the same joints. Intraoberserver and interobserver kappa values were calculated for both exercises. Results The web-based exercise yielded high kappa values both in intraobserver and interobserver evaluation for all sites, while in the patient-based exercise, inter-reader agreement was acceptable for the TFC and the AC. TFC reached high interobserver and intraobserver k values in both exercises, ranging from 0.75 to 0.87 (good to excellent agreement). AC reached moderate kappa values, from 0.51 to 0.85 (moderate to excellent agreement) and can readily be used for US CPPD identification. Conclusions Based on the results of our exercise, the OMERACT US definitions for the identification of CPPD demonstrated to be reliable when applied to the TFC and AC. Other sites reached good kappa values in the web-based exercise but failed to achieve good reproducibility at the patient-based exercise, meaning the scanning method must be further refined.",

Of 101 enrolled patients, 68 were included in the analysis. In 38 patients, the surgical specimens were insufficient. The overall diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for CPPD was of 75%\u2014sensitivity of 91% (range 71%\u201387% in single sites) and specificity of 59% (range 68%\u201392%). The best sensitivity and specificity were obtained by assessing in combination by ultrasound the medial meniscus and the medial condyle HC (88% and 76%, respectively). No differences were found between patients with and without CPPD regarding ultrasound signs of inflammation. Conclusion Ultrasound demonstrated to be an accurate tool for discriminating CPPD.

Ultrasound and microscopic analysis were performed by different operators, blinded to each other\u2019s findings. Results 11 researchers from seven countries participated in the study. Of 101 enrolled patients, 68 were included in the analysis. In 38 patients, the surgical specimens were insufficient. The overall diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for CPPD was of 75%\u2014sensitivity of 91% (range 71%\u201387% in single sites) and specificity of 59% (range 68%\u201392%). The best sensitivity and specificity were obtained by assessing in combination by ultrasound the medial meniscus and the medial condyle HC (88% and 76%, respectively). No differences were found between patients with and without CPPD regarding ultrasound signs of inflammation. Conclusion Ultrasound demonstrated to be an accurate tool for discriminating CPPD. No differences were found between patents with OA alone and CPPD plus OA regarding inflammation.",

This is an ancillary study of an international, multicentre cross-sectional study performed by the calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) subgroup of the OMERACT Ultrasound working group. Consecutive patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) waiting for total knee replacement surgery were enrolled in the study from 2 participating centres in Mexico and Romania. During the surgical procedures, synovial fluid, menisci and hyaline cartilage were collected and analysed within 48 hours from surgery under transmitted light microscopy and compensated polarised light microscopy for the presence/absence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. All slides were analysed by expert examiners on site, blinded to other findings. A dichotomic score (absence/ presence) was used for scoring both synovial fluid and tissues. Microscopic analysis of knee tissues was considered the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of synovial fluid analysis in the identification of calcium pyrophosphate crystals were calculated. 15 patients (53% female, mean age 68 yo \u00b1 8.4) with OA of grade 3 or 4 according to Kellgren-Lawrence scoring were enrolled. 12 patients (80%) were positive for calcium pyrophosphate crystals at the synovial fluid analysis and 14 (93%) at the tissue microscopic analysis. The overall diagnostic accuracy of synovial fluid analysis compared with histology for CPPD was 87%, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100%, the positive predictive value was 100% and the negative predictive value was 33%. In conclusion synovial fluid analysis proved to be an accurate test for the identification of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in patients with advanced OA.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Objective To develop the optimal US scanning protocol for the diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease. Methods In this cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with a crystal-proven diagnosis of CPPD disease, and age-, sex-matched disease controls with a negative synovial fluid analysis were prospectively enrolled in two Italian Institutions. Four rheumatologists, blinded to patients\u2019 clinical details, performed US examinations using a standardized scanning protocol including 20 joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints from second to fifth fingers, hips, knees, ankles). CPPD was identified as presence/absence, according to the OMERACT definitions. Reduced US scanning protocols were developed by selecting the most informative joints to be imaged by US using the LASSO technique. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation sets. Their diagnostic accuracy was tested comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The number of participants enrolled was 204: 102 with CPPD disease and 102 disease controls [age, mean (s.d.): 71.3\u2009(12.0) vs 71.1\u2009(13.5)\u2009years; female: 62.8% vs 57.8%]. The median number of joints with US evidence of CPPD was 5 [interquartile range (IQR): 4\u20137] and 0 (IQR: 0\u20131) in patients with CPPD disease and controls, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The detection of CPPD in \u22652 joints using a reduced scanning protocol (bilateral assessment of knees, wrists and hips) showed a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI: 82.8, 99.9) and a specificity of 100 (95% CI: 88.8, 100.0) for the diagnosis of CPPD disease and had good feasibility [mean (s.d.): 12.5\u2009(5.3)\u2009min]. Conclusion Bilateral US assessment of knees, wrists and hips had excellent accuracy and good feasibility for the diagnosis of CPPD disease.",
