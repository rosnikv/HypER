To obtain long-lasting effects with the anti-TNF-&agr; antibody infliximab repeated infusions are often required. Methotrexate has been shown to be a moderately effective drug in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the combination of infliximab and methotrexate as therapy for refractory Crohn's disease. Methods Nineteen patients with chronic active Crohn's disease resistant or intolerant to azathioprine were enrolled. Patients received either two infusions of infliximab (5\u2009mg/kg) alone (n=8) or in combination with long-term methotrexate at a dosage of 20\u2009mg/week (n=11) over 48 weeks. Results Two out of eight patients receiving infliximab monotherapy and four out of 11 patients treated with infliximab and concomitant methotrexate had discontinued study treatment by week 48, solely because of lack of efficacy. Clinical remission at week 48 was observed in five out of seven patients treated with infliximab and methotrexate, but only in two out of six patients receiving infliximab monotherapy. In addition, patients treated with concomitant methotrexate achieved remission earlier (median time 2 versus 18 weeks) and needed fewer steroids (median prednisolone dose 0 versus 11.8\u2009mg). Despite an increased mean number of adverse events per patient in the methotrexate group, the proportions of patients experiencing any adverse events and serious adverse events were similar across treatment groups. Conclusions The combination of infliximab with long-term methotrexate may be a promising concept in refractory Crohn's disease. Our data prompt larger trials.",

Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, unresponsiveness or intolerance to these drugs is common. The efficacy of methotrexate in maintenance of remission has been shown in adult Crohn disease; however, pediatric data are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in induction and maintenance of clinical remission in children with active Crohn disease who failed thiopurine treatment. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective multicenter study, efficacy of methotrexate in inducing and maintaining remission or response was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, paediatric Crohn disease activity index and steroid use, in 25 children with Crohn disease, refractory or intolerant to thiopurine analogues. Results: Crohn disease was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 \u00b1 3.1 years and methotrexate was initiated at age 14.5 \u00b1 3.1 years. The median methotrexate dose was 12.5 mg/m2. Remission was achieved in 16 patients (64%), and response in 6 patients (24%). Out of 18 patients treated for longer than 6 months, 83% were in remission or response after 12 months of treatment. The mean duration of remission and response was 10.8 \u00b1 8.8 months. Steroid withdrawal was possible in 12/16 patients (75%) receiving steroids at methotrexate introduction.

We assessed whether a short course of ondansetron minimized this adverse event. Patients and Methods: A retrospective case-control study of patients with CD who received MTX at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario between 2001 and 2009 was conducted. Results: Sixty-four patients received MTX during this time period. The mean age of diagnosis was 12.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.0 years (\u00b1 standard deviation), and the mean age when MTX was initiated was 13.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.6 years. Those receiving only 1 or 2 doses of MTX (N\u200a=\u200a4) and stopped for reasons other than development of nausea were not included in the analysis. Fifty patients received ondansetron premedication using a 4- to 8-week tapering schedule with MTX, and only 1 patient (2.0%) developed nausea within the first 3 months of MTX. In contrast, 6 of 10 patients (60.0%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) not premedicated with ondansetron reported nausea following MTX within 3 months. Four of these 6 patients subsequently received ondansetron and had no further complaints. Following ondansetron discontinuation, 5 of 50 (10%) patients developed nausea with subsequent MTX injections, but responded to reinstitution of ondansetron. Some children developed anticipatory nausea (6/60, 10%) and 3 experienced nausea relief after initiating premedication with ondansetron. Conclusions: Nausea following MTX is a common complaint in patients with CD. For most, this adverse effect may be prevented through the use of a short-course ondansetron as premedication. Ondansetron to treat MTX-induced nausea also can be successfully used but a proactive preventive strategy can be achieved.",

            "abstract": "Background: Methotrexate (MTX) intolerance is defined as gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms occurring before or after MTX administration that may lead to treatment discontinuation. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of MTX intolerance in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score developed in rheumatology and to identify risk factors for MTX intolerance. Methods: Patients with pediatric IBD followed in the IBD clinic of Sainte Justine Hospital who had received MTX for IBD between 2004 and 2016 and were still actively on MTX were invited to fill out the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire. A cutoff score of \u22656 points was used to define MTX intolerance, with at least one point for anticipatory, associative or behavioral items. Results: Among 102 pediatric patients with IBD, 32 (31%) patients reported symptoms of MTX intolerance. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, factors that were associated with having symptoms of MTX intolerance were female sex (odds ratio 4.31 [95% confidence interval, 1.37\u201313.60], P = 0.01), receiving a dose of MTX higher than 20 mg/wk at the time of the questionnaire (odds ratio 4.06 [95% confidence interval, 1.30\u201312.70], P = 0.02), and having active disease according to Physician's Global Assessment (odds ratio 3.44 [95% confidence interval, 1.15\u201310.26], P = 0.03). Prophylactic prescription of antiemetics and folic acid did not prevent symptoms of MTX intolerance. Conclusions: Symptoms of MTX intolerance are frequent in pediatric IBD. The Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire could help better recognition of these symptoms. Identification of risk factors could have important implications for the success of treatment.",

We aimed to investigate whether starting first-line IFX (FL-IFX) is more effective to achieve and maintain remission than conventional treatment. Design In this multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial, untreated patients with a new diagnosis of CD (3\u201317\u2009years old, weighted Paediatric CD Activity Index score (wPCDAI) >40) were assigned to groups that received five infusions of 5 mg/kg IFX at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 (FL-IFX), or EEN or oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg, maximum 40 mg) (conventional). The primary outcome was clinical remission on azathioprine, defined as a wPCDAI <12.5 at week 52, without need for treatment escalation, using intention-to-treat analysis. Results 100 patients were included, 50 in the FL-IFX group and 50 in the conventional group. Four patients did not receive treatment as per protocol. At week 10, a higher proportion of patients in the FL-IFX group than in the conventional group achieved clinical (59% vs 34%, respectively, p=0.021) and endoscopic remission (59% vs 17%, respectively, p=0.001). At week 52, the proportion of patients in clinical remission was not significantly different (p=0.421). However, 19/46 (41%) patients in the FL-IFX group were in clinical remission on azathioprine monotherapy without need for treatment escalation vs 7/48 (15%) in the conventional group (p=0.004). Conclusions FL-IFX was superior to conventional treatment in achieving short-term clinical and endoscopic remission, and had greater likelihood of maintaining clinical remission at week 52 on azathioprine monotherapy.

We aimed to investigate whether starting first-line IFX (FL-IFX) is more effective to achieve and maintain remission than conventional treatment. Design In this multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial, untreated patients with a new diagnosis of CD (3\u201317\u2009years old, weighted Paediatric CD Activity Index score (wPCDAI) >40) were assigned to groups that received five infusions of 5 mg/kg IFX at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 (FL-IFX), or EEN or oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg, maximum 40 mg) (conventional). The primary outcome was clinical remission on azathioprine, defined as a wPCDAI <12.5 at week 52, without need for treatment escalation, using intention-to-treat analysis. Results 100 patients were included, 50 in the FL-IFX group and 50 in the conventional group. Four patients did not receive treatment as per protocol. At week 10, a higher proportion of patients in the FL-IFX group than in the conventional group achieved clinical (59% vs 34%, respectively, p=0.021) and endoscopic remission (59% vs 17%, respectively, p=0.001). At week 52, the proportion of patients in clinical remission was not significantly different (p=0.421). However, 19/46 (41%) patients in the FL-IFX group were in clinical remission on azathioprine monotherapy without need for treatment escalation vs 7/48 (15%) in the conventional group (p=0.004).

            "abstract": "Background and aims In recent years, biological agents, such as anti-TNF-\u03b1 blockers, have been introduced and have shown efficacy in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, the prescription mode differentiated into a first/second line application, and efficacy and side effects are evaluated beginning from 2004 until today. Methods Statistical analyses of the prospective and ongoing CEDATA multicenter registry data from the Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (GPGE) were performed for patients receiving a biological agent at least once during the period from June 2004 until November 2020 (n = 487). The analyzed parameters were patient demographics, disease extent and behavior, prior or concurrent therapies, duration and outcome of biological therapy, disease-associated complications, drug-related complications, laboratory parameters and treatment response as determined by the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment. Results Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) was present in 71.5% of patients, and 52% were boys. Patients showed high disease activity when receiving a first-line TNF-\u03b1 blocker. After 2016, patients who failed to respond to anti-TNF-\u03b1 induction therapy were treated with off-label biologics (vedolizumab 4.3% and ustekinumab 2.1%). Propensity score matching indicated that patients with CD and higher disease activity benefitted significantly more from early anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy. This assessment was based on a clinical evaluation and lab parameters related to inflammation compared to delayed second-line treatment. Additionally, first-line treatment resulted in less treatment failure and fewer extraintestinal manifestations during TNF-\u03b1 blockade. Conclusion First-line treatment with anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs is effective and safe. An earlier start significantly reduces the risk of treatment failure and is associated with fewer extraintestinal manifestations during longitudinal follow-up.",
