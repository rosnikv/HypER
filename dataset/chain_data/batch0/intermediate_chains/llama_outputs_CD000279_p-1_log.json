The exact magnitude of the risk is not clearly defined. Current surveillance programmes use dysplasia as a marker for the risk of invasive carcinoma development, but this strategy has inherent limitations. A number of new molecular markers have been investigated but none are currently considered robust enough for routine clinical use. Recommendations for patient selection and interval for colonoscopic surveillance are currently pragmatic, and not entirely evidence-based. Nevertheless, optimal medical management and adherence to a surveillance programme geared to detect dysplasia might still be the best risk reduction strategy.",

            "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity and diabetes mellitus may be risk factors for colon cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of how these chronic diseases promote colon carcinogenesis remain unknown. C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice have obese and diabetic phenotypes because of disruption of the leptin receptor. The present study was designed to investigate whether development of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced dysplastic and early neoplastic (premalignant) lesions of the colon is modulated in db/db mice. Homozygous db/db mice, heterozygous db/+ mice and littermate controls (+/+) were injected with AOM under food restriction ( approximately 10.8 kcal/mouse/day) and killed 5 weeks after the carcinogen treatment. Their colons were assessed for premalignant lesions induced by AOM. We found a significant increase in the multiplicity of the total premalignant lesions in db/db mice when compared with db/+ or +/+ mice. Phenotypically, serum leptin and insulin levels in db/db mice were significantly higher than those in db/+ or +/+ mice, whereas the body weights and glucose levels in blood of db/db, db/+ and +/+ mice were comparable. In addition, immunostaining of the leptin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor showed up-regulation of these protein levels specifically in the lesions. Our data indicate that development of AOM-induced premalignant lesions is enhanced in db/db mice with hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia. The results have important implications for further exploration of the possible underlying events that affect the positive association between colon cancer and chronic diseases (obesity and diabetes).",

However, there is a lack of information about the relationship between metabolic syndrome and colorectal adenoma. Therefore, we investigated whether metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for colorectal adenoma. Methods: We did a study for consecutive subjects who underwent colonoscopy as a screening exam at the Center for Health Promotion, Samsung Medical Center, from March 2004 to December 2005. According to the modified ATP III criteria, metabolic syndrome was diagnosed. We classified a total of 2,531 subjects into the adenoma group (n = 731) and the control group (n = 1,800), including normal colonoscopic finding, nonpolyp benign lesions, or histologically confirmed hyperplastic polyp. Results: The prevalence for metabolic syndrome was 17% in the adenoma group and 11% in the control group. On the multiple logistic regression analyses, metabolic syndrome was found to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.93). Also, waist circumference among the individual components of metabolic syndrome was an independent risk factor for colorectal adenoma. An increased risk for metabolic syndrome was more evident for proximal than distal colon, for multiple (\u22653), and for advanced adenoma in the adenoma group.

            "abstract": "Background: The consistent association between obesity and colorectal cancer is thought to be explained by metabolic disturbances common, but not exclusive, to the obese. Methods: We assessed the relation between metachronous neoplasia and the components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III in 2,392 participants of two previously conducted chemoprevention trials. Waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, trigylcerides, high-density lipoprotein, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at baseline. Results: MetS classification was associated with increased odds of metachronous neoplasia among women [odds ratio (OR), 1.37; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.01-1.85] but not among men (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81-1.21). High waist circumference in men (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.72) and women (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.90) and elevated fasting glucose in women (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.96), as defined by Adult Treatment Panel III cutpoints, were associated with increased odds, whereas none of the other criteria were independently associated with metachronous neoplasia. When each trait was evaluated using quartiles, elevated glucose among women and large waist circumference among men were significantly associated with metachronous lesions. Exploratory analysis of waist circumference and fasting glucose suggested an interaction, where only the combination of large waist circumference and elevated glucose conferred significant increased odds of metachronous neoplasia among both men (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.78; Pinteraction = 0.08) and women (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.26-2.67; Pinteraction = 0.12). Conclusions: These results suggest that, of the specific components of MetS, those that capture impaired glucose uptake increased the odds of metachronous neoplasia.

            "abstract": "Many previous reports have documented a relationship between metabolic syndrome, in terms of insulin resistance, and colorectal cancer. However, the association of insulin resistance with colorectal adenoma has not been investigated in detail. To elucidate the association of metabolic syndrome components and insulin resistance with adenoma, we investigated homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in individuals with adenoma. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving individuals who underwent scheduled health examinations using total colonoscopy. Restricting the subjects to males, 261 with adenoma and 702 without adenoma were investigated. HOMA-IR was categorized into three groups: normal (< 1.6), intermediate (\u2265 1.6 - < 2.5), and insulin resistance (2.5 \u2264). Metabolic syndrome was defined by a combination of any three of the following components: central obesity (waist circumference \u2265 90 cm); elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure \u2265 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg); elevated fasting plasma glucose (\u2265 100 mg/dL); reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (< 40 mg/dL); and elevated triglyceride (\u2265 150 mg/dL). Multivariate analysis of HOMA-IR showed that the intermediate and insulin resistance groups had a significantly increased risk for colorectal adenoma, even after adjustment for waist circumference (odds ratio, 1.62 and 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.45 and 1.31-3.79, respectively). Accumulation of any metabolic syndrome components increased the risk of colorectal adenoma (P trend = 0.001). However, none of the components alone demonstrated a significant risk for colorectal adenoma. Our data indicate that an increased level of HOMA-IR is a risk factor for colorectal adenoma in Japanese males.",

            "abstract": "Many previous reports have documented a relationship between metabolic syndrome, in terms of insulin resistance, and colorectal cancer. However, the association of insulin resistance with colorectal adenoma has not been investigated in detail. To elucidate the association of metabolic syndrome components and insulin resistance with adenoma, we investigated homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in individuals with adenoma. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving individuals who underwent scheduled health examinations using total colonoscopy. Restricting the subjects to males, 261 with adenoma and 702 without adenoma were investigated. HOMA-IR was categorized into three groups: normal (< 1.6), intermediate (\u2265 1.6 - < 2.5), and insulin resistance (2.5 \u2264). Metabolic syndrome was defined by a combination of any three of the following components: central obesity (waist circumference \u2265 90 cm); elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure \u2265 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg); elevated fasting plasma glucose (\u2265 100 mg/dL); reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (< 40 mg/dL); and elevated triglyceride (\u2265 150 mg/dL). Multivariate analysis of HOMA-IR showed that the intermediate and insulin resistance groups had a significantly increased risk for colorectal adenoma, even after adjustment for waist circumference (odds ratio, 1.62 and 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.45 and 1.31-3.79, respectively). Accumulation of any metabolic syndrome components increased the risk of colorectal adenoma (P trend = 0.001). However, none of the components alone demonstrated a significant risk for colorectal adenoma. Our data indicate that an increased level of HOMA-IR is a risk factor for colorectal adenoma in Japanese males.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between FI and cancer risk and to explore its potential mediator role in the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer. Methods Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of FI on overall and 14 site-specific cancers using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level data from Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) and consortia of 14 site-specific cancers. The primary MR approach was conducted by using the random-effect inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and sensitivity analyses were implemented by adopting weighted-median, weighted-mode, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO tests. Polygenic risk score analysis was executed by using individual-level data from UK Biobank to validate the findings from TSMR analyses. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was carried out to estimate the mediation effect of FI on the association between T2DM and cancer. Results TSMR study suggested that genetically determined high FI levels were associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.23\u20132.84, p = 0.003) and endometrial cancer (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.08\u20133.01, p = 0.008), but not associated with overall cancer risk or the other 12 studied cancer sites. Polygenic risk score analysis successfully replicated the association between genetic liability to high FI levels and the increased risk of colorectal and endometrial cancers. MVMR and MR mediation analyses detected an intermediary effect of FI and quantified that FI mediated 21.3% of the association between T2DM and endometrial cancer. Conclusions This study demonstrated that FI levels are associated with the risk of colorectal and endometrial cancers, and FI was found to play an intermediary role in the association between T2DM and endometrial cancer.
