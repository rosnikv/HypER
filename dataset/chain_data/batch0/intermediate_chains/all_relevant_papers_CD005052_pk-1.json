        "abstract": "Objective To confirm the effect of Shengmai injection in improving cardiac function in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to explore its influence on inflammatory reaction in patients. Methods Ninety ACS patients were randomised into two groups, the control group, treated with conventional therapy and the SMI group, treated with SMI. The patients' cardiac function was noted and the high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in venous blood was measured before treatment and 1\u2005week and 2\u2005weeks after treatment, so as to observe and compare their changes in the two groups. Results The cardiac output, stroke volume and ejection fraction in the SMI group after 3\u2005weeks of treatment were all higher than those in the control group (p<0.05). The serum content of hsCRP was reduced in both groups, but the reduction in the SMI group was more significant than that in the control group. Conclusion SMI could improve cardiac function and further inhibit the inflammatory reaction in patients with ACS.",

        "explanation": "This paper builds upon the source paper's findings regarding the effectiveness of Shengmai injection in improving heart function. The current paper explores its effects on cardiac function and inflammatory reaction in patients with acute coronary syndrome, using the source paper's results as a sub-hypothesis."
