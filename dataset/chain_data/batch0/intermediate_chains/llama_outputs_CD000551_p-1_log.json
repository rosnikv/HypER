            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has any effect on the development of liver decompensation and on survival of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).METHODS:A total of 86 patients with compensated PBC were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (n = 43) or to remain untreated (controls, n = 43). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Mean follow-up was 7.3 \u00b1 3.0 yr in the UDCA and 8.1 \u00b1 3.1 yr in the control group. Fourteen control patients were crossed-over to UDCA therapy after a median of 3.5 yr (range 2\u20138 yr), at their own request.RESULTS:Liver decompensation developed in 41 patients (22 in the UDCA and 19 in the control group) and liver death or transplantation in 33 (19 in the UDCA and 14 in the control group) patients. There was no significant difference in the probability of development of liver decompensation, liver death, or transplantation (by log-rank test) between UDCA-treated and control patients, whether by an intention-to-treat or by treatment-as-received analysis.CONCLUSIONS:UDCA was not found to have any demonstrable effect on the long-term outcome of PBC and did not improve the survival of PBC patients.",

Survival after OLT is excellent, although recent data have shown a recurrence rate of PBC of up to 32% after transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate the course after disease recurrence, particularly with regard to liver function and survival in a long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Between April 1989 and April 2003, 1553 liver transplantations were performed in 1415 patients at the Charit\u00e9, Virchow Clinic. Protocol liver biopsies were taken after one, three, five, seven, 10 and 13\u2003yr. One hundred (7%) patients suffered from histologically proven PBC. Primary immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (n=54) or tacrolimus (Tac) (n=46). Immediately after OLT, all patients received ursodeoxycholic acid. Corticosteroids were withdrawn three to six months after OLT. The median age of the 85 women and 15 men was 55\u2003yr (range 25\u201366\u2003yr). The median follow\u2010up after liver transplantation was 118 months (range 16\u2013187 months) and after recurrence 30 months (range 4\u201379 months). Actuarial patient survival after five, 10 and 15\u2003yr was 87, 84 and 82% respectively. Ten patients (10%) died after a median survival time of 32 months. Two of these patients developed organ dysfunction owing to recurrence of PBC. Histological recurrence was found in 14 patients (14%) after a median time of 61 months (range 36\u2013122 months). Patients with Tac immunosuppression developed PBC recurrence more often (p<0.05) and also earlier (p<0.05). Fifty\u2010seven patients developed an acute rejection and two patients a chronic rejection episode. Liver function did not alter within the first five\u2003yr after histologically proven PBC recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the investigated patients showed that the recipient's age and Tac immunosuppression were significant risk factors for PBC recurrence. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up of up to 15\u2003yr after liver transplantation, owing to PBC, in addition to maintenance of liver function, shows excellent organ and patient survival rates. Although protocol liver biopsies revealed histological recurrence in 14 (14%) patients, only two patients developed graft dysfunction. Tac\u2010treated patients showed more frequently and also earlier histologically proven PBC recurrence; however, in our population we could not observe an impact on graft dysfunction and patient's survival.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only effective curative therapy for end\u2010stage primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Survival after OLT is excellent, although recent data have shown a recurrence rate of PBC of up to 32% after transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate the course after disease recurrence, particularly with regard to liver function and survival in a long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Between April 1989 and April 2003, 1553 liver transplantations were performed in 1415 patients at the Charit\u00e9, Virchow Clinic. Protocol liver biopsies were taken after one, three, five, seven, 10 and 13\u2003yr. One hundred (7%) patients suffered from histologically proven PBC. Primary immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (n=54) or tacrolimus (Tac) (n=46). Immediately after OLT, all patients received ursodeoxycholic acid. Corticosteroids were withdrawn three to six months after OLT. The median age of the 85 women and 15 men was 55\u2003yr (range 25\u201366\u2003yr). The median follow\u2010up after liver transplantation was 118 months (range 16\u2013187 months) and after recurrence 30 months (range 4\u201379 months). Actuarial patient survival after five, 10 and 15\u2003yr was 87, 84 and 82% respectively. Ten patients (10%) died after a median survival time of 32 months. Two of these patients developed organ dysfunction owing to recurrence of PBC. Histological recurrence was found in 14 patients (14%) after a median time of 61 months (range 36\u2013122 months). Patients with Tac immunosuppression developed PBC recurrence more often (p<0.05) and also earlier (p<0.05). Fifty\u2010seven patients developed an acute rejection and two patients a chronic rejection episode. Liver function did not alter within the first five\u2003yr after histologically proven PBC recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the investigated patients showed that the recipient's age and Tac immunosuppression were significant risk factors for PBC recurrence. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up of up to 15\u2003yr after liver transplantation, owing to PBC, in addition to maintenance of liver function, shows excellent organ and patient survival rates. Although protocol liver biopsies revealed histological recurrence in 14 (14%) patients, only two patients developed graft dysfunction. Tac\u2010treated patients showed more frequently and also earlier histologically proven PBC recurrence; however, in our population we could not observe an impact on graft dysfunction and patient's survival.",

The efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for treatment of recurrent PBC after liver transplantation (LT) remains less well known. The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to determine the significance of recurrent PBC on overall survival among PBC patients who underwent LT, and 2) to determine the efficacy of UDCA treatment after LT in patients with recurrent PBC. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 154 PBC patients who underwent LT with at least 1 yr of follow\u2010up after transplantation from 1985 through 2005. A total of 52 patients with recurrent PBC were identified. After adjusting for age and gender, recurrent PBC was not associated with death or liver retransplantation (hazard ratio, 0.97, 95% confidence interval, 0.41\u20132.31; P = 0.9). A total of 38 patients with recurrent PBC received UDCA at an average dose of 12 mg/kg/day for a mean duration of 55 months. Over a 36\u2010month period, an estimated 52% of UDCA\u2010treated patients experienced normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase compared to 22% of untreated patients.

In conclusion, the development of recurrent PBC has little impact on long\u2010term survival or need for retransplantation.

            "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases are characterized by immune-mediated inflammation and eventual destruction of the hepatocytes and the biliary epithelial cells. They can progress to irreversible liver damage requiring liver transplantation. The post-liver transplant goals of treatment include improving the recipient\u2019s survival, preventing liver graft-failure, and decreasing the recurrence of the disease. The keystone in post-liver transplant management for autoimmune liver diseases relies on identifying which would be the most appropriate immunosuppressive maintenance therapy. The combination of a steroid and a calcineurin inhibitor is the current immunosuppressive regimen of choice for autoimmune hepatitis. A gradual withdrawal of glucocorticoids is also recommended. On the other hand, ursodeoxycholic acid should be initiated soon after liver transplant to prevent recurrence and improve graft and patient survival in primary biliary cholangitis recipients. Unlike the previously mentioned autoimmune diseases, there are not immunosuppressive or disease-modifying agents available for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, colectomy and annual colonoscopy are key components during the post-liver transplant period.",

            "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases are characterized by immune-mediated inflammation and eventual destruction of the hepatocytes and the biliary epithelial cells. They can progress to irreversible liver damage requiring liver transplantation. The post-liver transplant goals of treatment include improving the recipient\u2019s survival, preventing liver graft-failure, and decreasing the recurrence of the disease. The keystone in post-liver transplant management for autoimmune liver diseases relies on identifying which would be the most appropriate immunosuppressive maintenance therapy. The combination of a steroid and a calcineurin inhibitor is the current immunosuppressive regimen of choice for autoimmune hepatitis. A gradual withdrawal of glucocorticoids is also recommended. On the other hand, ursodeoxycholic acid should be initiated soon after liver transplant to prevent recurrence and improve graft and patient survival in primary biliary cholangitis recipients. Unlike the previously mentioned autoimmune diseases, there are not immunosuppressive or disease-modifying agents available for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, colectomy and annual colonoscopy are key components during the post-liver transplant period.",
