            "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",

            "abstract": "Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), especially p38 MAPK, plays an important role in the development of central sensitization related to persistent inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture (EA) is well known to relieve persistent inflammatory pain. However, little is known about relationship between EA and p38 MAPK. Inflammatory pain rat model was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Male adult SD rats were randomly divided into the saline group, CFA group, and CFA + EA group. EA (constant saquare wave, 2\u2009Hz and 100\u2009Hz alternating frequencies, intensities ranging from 1 to 2\u2009mA) was applied to bilateral \u201cZusanli\u201d (ST 36) and \u201cKunlun\u201d acupoints (BL 60) for 30\u2009min, once per day. The paw edema and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured at preinjection and days postinjection 1, 3, and 14. Spinal p-p38MAPK- immunoreactivty (p-p38MAPK-IR) cells were detected by immunohistochemistry at postinjection day 3 and 14. EA significantly inhibited paw edema at postinjection days 14 and increased PWT at postinjection days 3 and 14. Moreover, the increasing number of spinal p-p38MAPK-IR cells which was induced by CFA injection was suppressed by EA stimulation. These results indicate that anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of EA might be associated with its inhibition of spinal p38 MAPK activation and thereby provide a potential mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory pain by EA.",

            "abstract": "Our previous study indicated that electroacupuncture (EA) could increase neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) levels in the injured spinal cord, stimulate the differentiation of transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and improve functional recovery in the injured spinal cord of rats. However, the number of neuron-like cells derived from the MSCs is limited. It is known that NT-3 promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons by preferentially binding to its receptor TrkC. In this study, we attempted to transplant TrkC gene-modified MSCs (TrkC-MSCs) into the spinal cord with transection to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the injured spinal cord and to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance transplanted MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into neuron-like cells, resulting in increased axonal regeneration and functional improvement in the injured spinal cord. Our results showed that EA increased NT-3 levels; furthermore, it promoted neuron-phenotype differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelin formation of transplanted TrkC-MSCs. In addition, TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA (the TrkC-MSCs + EA group) treatment promoted the growth of the descending BDA-labeled corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and 5-HT-positive axonal regeneration across the lesion site into the caudal cord. In addition, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and hindlimb locomotor function increased as compared to controls (treated with the LacZ-MSCs, TrkC-MSCs, and LacZ-MSCs + EA groups). In the TrkC-MSCs + EA group, the injured spinal cord also showed upregulated expression of the proneurogenic factors laminin and GAP-43 and downregulated GFAP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major inhibitors of axonal growth. Together, our data suggest that TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment spinal cord injury not only increased MSC survival and differentiation into neuron-like cells but also promoted CST regeneration across injured sites to the caudal cord and functional improvement, perhaps due to increase of NT-3 levels, upregulation of laminin and GAP-43, and downregulation of GFAP and CSPG proteins.",

In this study, we attempted to transplant TrkC gene-modified MSCs (TrkC-MSCs) into the spinal cord with transection to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the injured spinal cord and to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance transplanted MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into neuron-like cells, resulting in increased axonal regeneration and functional improvement in the injured spinal cord. Our results showed that EA increased NT-3 levels; furthermore, it promoted neuron-phenotype differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelin formation of transplanted TrkC-MSCs. In addition, TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA (the TrkC-MSCs + EA group) treatment promoted the growth of the descending BDA-labeled corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and 5-HT-positive axonal regeneration across the lesion site into the caudal cord. In addition, the conduction of cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and hindlimb locomotor function increased as compared to controls (treated with the LacZ-MSCs, TrkC-MSCs, and LacZ-MSCs + EA groups). In the TrkC-MSCs + EA group, the injured spinal cord also showed upregulated expression of the proneurogenic factors laminin and GAP-43 and downregulated GFAP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major inhibitors of axonal growth. Together, our data suggest that TrkC-MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment spinal cord injury not only increased MSC survival and differentiation into neuron-like cells but also promoted CST regeneration across injured sites to the caudal cord and functional improvement, perhaps due to increase of NT-3 levels, upregulation of laminin and GAP-43, and downregulation of GFAP and CSPG proteins.",

However, it is still a circuitous conundrum finding a practical remyelinating therapy. Electroacupuncture (EA), originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat CNS diseases all over the world, but the role of EA in demyelinating diseases is barely known. In this study, we examined the remyelinating properties and mechanisms of EA in cuprizone-induced demyelinating model, a CNS demyelinating murine model of multiple sclerosis. By feeding C57BL/6 mice with chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks, we successfully induce demyelination as proved by weight change, beam test, pole test, histomorphology, and Western Blot. EA treatment significantly improves the neurobehavioral performance at week 7 (2 weeks after withdrawing cuprizone chow). RNA-seq and RT-PCR results reveal up-regulated expression of myelin-related genes, and the expression of myelin associated protein (MBP, CNPase, and O4) are also increased after EA treatment, indicating therapeutic effect of EA on cuprizone model. It is widely acknowledged that microglia exert phagocytic effect on degraded myelin debris and clear these detrimental debris, which is a necessary process for subsequent remyelination. We found the remyelinating effect of EA is associated with enhanced clearance of degraded myelin debris as detected by dMBP staining and red oil O staining. Our further studies suggest that more microglia assemble in demyelinating area (corpus callosum) during the process of EA treatment, and cells inside corpus callosum are mostly in a plump, ameboid, and phagocytic shape, quite different from the ramified cells outside corpus callosum. RNA-seq result also unravels that most genes relating to positive regulation of phagocytosis (GO:0050766) are up-regulated, indicating enhanced phagocytic process after EA treatment. During the process of myelin debris clearance, microglia tend to change their phenotype toward M2 phenotype. Thus, we also probed into the phenotype of microglia in our study. Immuno-staining results show increased expression of CD206 and Arg1, and the ratio of CD206/CD16/32 are also higher in EA group. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time that EA enhances myelin debris removal from activated microglia after demyelination, and promotes remyelination.",

They first exist as amoeboid microglial cells (AMCs) in the developing brain, but with brain maturation, they transform into ramified microglial cells (RMCs).

            "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of periventricular white matter (PWM) damage (PWMD) induced by neonatal sepsis. Because the complement cascade is implicated in inflammatory response, this study was carried out to determine whether C3a is involved in PWMD, and, if so, whether it would induce axonal hypomyelination. Furthermore, we explored if C3a would act through its C3a receptor (C3aR) and thence inhibit maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) via the WNT/\u03b2\u2010catenin signal pathway. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 1 day were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg/kg). C3a was upregulated in activated microglia and astrocytes in the PWM up to 7 days after LPS injection. Concomitantly, enhanced C3aR expression was observed in NG2+ oligodendrocytes (OLs). Myelin proteins including CNPase, PLP, MBP and MAG were significantly reduced in the PWM of 28\u2010day septic rats. The number of PLP+ and MBP+ cells was markedly decreased. By electron microscopy, myelin sheath thickness was thinner and the average g\u2010ratios were higher. This was coupled with an increase in number of NG2+ cells and decreased number of CC1+ cells. Olig1, Olig2 and SOX10 protein expression was significantly reduced in the PWM after LPS injection. Very strikingly, C3aRa administration for the first 7 days could reverse the above\u2010mentioned pathological alterations in the PWM of septic rats. When incubated with C3a, expression of MBP, CNPase, PLP, MAG, Olig1, Olig2, SOX10 and CC1 in primary cultured OPCs was significantly downregulated as opposed to increased NG2. Moreover, WNT/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling pathway was found to be implicated in inhibition of OPCs maturation and differentiation induced by C3a in vitro. As a corollary, it is speculated that C3a in the PWM of septic rats is closely associated with the disorder of OPCs differentiation and maturation through WNT/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling pathway, which would contribute ultimately to axonal hypomyelination.",

            "abstract": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) leads to progressive deterioration of cognitive function, especially in aged patients. Demyelination is closely associated with cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationship between PND and demyelination remains unclear. Here we showed that demyelination was related to the pathogenesis of PND. Clemastine, an antihistamine with potency in remyelination, was predicted to have a potential therapeutic effect on PND by next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics in our previous study. In the present study, it was given at 10 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks to evaluate the effects on PND in aged mice. We found that clemastine ameliorated PND and reduced the expression levels of inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). Further investigation suggested clemastine increased the expression of oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) and myelin basic protein (MBP) to enhance remyelination by inhibiting the overactivation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway. At the same time, the expression of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95, or DLG4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and neuronal nuclei (NEUN) were also improved. Our results suggested that clemastine might be a therapy for PND caused by anesthetic and surgical factors in aged patients.",

            "abstract": "Multiple genetic, metabolic, and environmental abnormalities are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia (AD). If all of those abnormalities were addressed it should be possible to reverse the dementia; however, that would require a suffocating volume of drugs. Nevertheless, the problem may be simplified by using available data to address, instead, the brain cells whose functions become changed as a result of the abnormalities, because at least eleven drugs are available from which to formulate a rational therapy to correct those changes. The affected brain cell types are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells/pericytes, and microglia. The available drugs include clemastine, dantrolene, erythropoietin, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, minocycline, pioglitazone, piracetam, and riluzole. This article describes the ways by which the individual cell types contribute to AD\u2019s pathogenesis and how each of the drugs corrects the changes in the cell types. All five of the cell types may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD; of the 11 drugs, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, and pioglitazone, each address all five of the cell types. Fingolimod only slightly addresses endothelial cells, and memantine is the weakest of the remaining four. Low doses of either two or three drugs are suggested in order to minimize the likelihood of toxicity and drug\u2013drug interactions (including drugs used for co-morbidities). Suggested two-drug combinations are pioglitazone plus lithium and pioglitazone plus fluoxetine; a three-drug combination could add either clemastine or memantine. Clinical trials are required to validate that the suggest combinations may reverse AD.",
