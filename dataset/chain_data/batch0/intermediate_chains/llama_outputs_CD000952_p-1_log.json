            "abstract": "Long-term administration of low doses of corticosteroids is common in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, and allergic conditions. Although treatment with high doses of corticosteroids causes osteoporosis (especially in trabecular bone, such as that found in the lumbar spine [1]), use of corticosteroids in low doses (<10 mg/d) was thought to be associated with few substantial side effects [2]. However, recent research suggests that use of low doses of corticosteroids is also associated with loss of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine [3-6] and that patients receiving continuous therapy with low-dose corticosteroids have a higher rate of vertebral fracture [7-9]. Corticosteroids cause osteoporosis by several mechanisms, such as decreasing levels of sex steroids [10, 11] and direct effects on osteoblast [12] and osteoclast function [13]. Use of corticosteroids also decreases absorption of intestinal calcium [14-17], thereby causing secondary hyperparathyroidism [18]. Some studies [19, 20] have shown that vitamin D3 and its more potent analogues can improve calcium absorption in patients receiving corticosteroids. Treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and calcium stabilized bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in patients receiving moderate to high doses of corticosteroids [21]. However, calcitriol is a potent vitamin D analogue that can cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria [22]. The associated toxicity and expense make it impractical for widespread use for prevention of bone loss in all patients receiving long-term treatment with low-dose corticosteroids. Vitamin D3, the parent compound, is generally well tolerated and rarely causes side effects when used in the recommended dosage (400 to 800 IU/d). It has been suggested that vitamin D3 and calcium should be given to all patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy [23]. However, few data support this approach. Early studies [24] suggested that calcium and pharmacologic dosages of vitamin D3 (50 000 IU three times a week) increased bone mineral density in patients taking long-term corticosteroids, but bone mineral density was measured only in the radius. Adachi and colleagues [25] recently reported that treatment with calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (50 000 IU/wk) did not prevent bone loss associated with moderate- to high-dose treatment with corticosteroids, but Healy and colleagues [26] found that calcium and vitamin D3 prevented substantial loss of bone mineral density in a similar group of patients starting corticosteroid treatment. No randomized, controlled, clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation for prevention of bone loss secondary to long-term low-dose corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, we studied the effects of calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (500 IU/d) supplementation on the bone mineral density of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and contrasted the efficacy of this supplementation in patients who were and those who were not receiving corticosteroids. Methods Patients Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were followed at the University of Vermont, College of Medicine (n = 354) were identified through a computer listing by diagnostic code. All identified patients were contacted by mail and asked whether they were interested in participating in a study of the effects of rheumatoid arthritis and medication on bone mineral density. Patients were eligible if they were between 18 and 65 years of age and had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis as defined by the revised American College of Rheumatology criteria [27], serum creatinine level less than 176.8 mol/L, and normal liver function. Patients were excluded if they were receiving an anticonvulsant medication, hydrochlorothiazide, bisphosphonates, fluoride, calcitonin, or calcitriol or if they had a history of malabsorption, hyperparathyroidism, immobilization, metabolic bone disease, or thyroid disease with an abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone. One hundred thirty patients met these criteria, agreed to participate, and entered the study between January 1991 and January 1992. Study Design The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the University of Vermont, and informed consent was obtained as patients entered the study. Patients were stratified by sex, menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal without estrogen replacement, or postmenopausal with estrogen replacement), and current dosage of prednisone (<10 mg/d or 10 mg/d). Patients were randomly assigned in blocks of four to a treatment group using a random-number table. Group assignment was kept in sealed envelopes to ensure blinding. Patients received either calcium carbonate (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (500 IU/d) (two tablets twice a day of Os-Cal 250 + D, SmithKline Beecham Healthcare, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) or an identical placebo. Study medication was taken with breakfast and dinner. Measurement Demographic information and information about risk factors for osteoporosis, such as smoking history, use of alcohol, menstrual history, parity, fracture history, and use of medications (including thyroid medication and estrogen replacement therapy) were obtained from questionnaires given at the beginning of the study and annually thereafter. Calcium intake was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire [28] and 3-day dietary history. Disease-related information included activity level, measured by the Framingham Activity Index [29]; disease severity, measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire [30]; and a severity score, based on radiologic findings [31]. Information about disease duration and use of prednisone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was ascertained by chart review. Bone mineral densities of the femur (femoral neck, Ward triangle, and trochanter) and lumbar spine were measured in all patients by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Corp., Madison, Wisconsin) at the beginning of the study and at yearly follow-up visits. All studies were done using the same machine. Stability of measurement was assured with daily quality-assurance calibration by the manufacturer, weekly Lunar aluminum phantom in water bath, and Hologic spine phantom three times weekly. The coefficient of variation (calculated using 11 patients and three measurements) was 1.2% for the anteroposterior spine and 2.2% for the femoral neck. At the start of the study, the lateral scan of the spine was thought to be the most sensitive measurement for detecting changes induced by cortico-steroids [32]. However, we and others [33] have found the reproducibility of this view with the available technology to be suboptimal, especially in patients with arthritis, because correct positioning is difficult. We subsequently obtained anteroposterior scans of the spine. For patients from whom only the lateral view of the spine was available at baseline (n = 48 [20 patients in the treatment group and 28 in the placebo group]), we determined the anteroposterior value by adding the difference between the anteroposterior and lateral scans obtained after the first year of the study to the lateral scan obtained at baseline. This provided adequate measurement because the differences between anteroposterior and lateral views for each patient remained relatively constant (within 0.10 0.07 g/cm2 for 87% of patients). Patients were seen by the study coordinator at 6-month intervals to assess compliance. At these visits, pills were counted and patients were questioned about side effects of medication. Statistical Analysis Because loss of bone mineral density over time is presumed to be proportional to the amount of bone mineral density remaining, the yearly rate of change () was estimated using data from the three time points (baseline, year 1, and year 2) in the following equation: Equation 1 Differences in rates for the two treatment groups were assessed by using the t-test. The effect of treatment after adjustment for group differences in disease severity and duration was examined by linear regression analysis. Patients who received prednisone during the study and those who did not were analyzed separately and in combination. Clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square tests. Potential interactions between treatment effects and patient characteristics were examined by analysis of variance. All analyses were done using SPS statistical software (SPS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Results Baseline characteristics of the patients completing both years of the study are listed in Table 1. The patients studied were primarily middle-aged white women. Although study groups were similar for most characteristics, the patients receiving calcium and vitamin D3 tended to have disease of greater severity (by radiologic stage) and longer duration than did those receiving placebo. Among patients who were receiving corticosteroids, the mean dosage of prednisone at the initial visit was 5.9 mg/d for the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 5.0 mg/d for the placebo group. During the first year of study, 68% of patients were taking prednisone (mean dosage, 5.5 mg/d; range, 1 to 20 mg/d); during the second year, 65% were taking prednisone (mean dosage, 5.6 mg/d; range, 0.5 to 20 mg/d). Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Patients Who Had Bone Mineral Density Measurements Available for All Time Points* During the 2-year study period, 29 of the original 130 patients (22%) dropped out of the study. Fifteen of the patients who dropped out had been in the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 14 had been in the placebo group. Fourteen patients withdrew for personal reasons, 1 patient died, and 3 patients developed serious illness (inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Eleven patients (7 in the calcium and vitamin D3 group and 4 in the placebo group) dropped out of the study because",

We also conducted a hand search of abstracts from various scientific meetings and reference lists of selected trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nAll randomized trials comparing calcium and vitamin D to calcium alone or placebo in patients taking systemic corticosteroids.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData was abstracted from trials by two investigators. Methodological quality was assessed in a similar manner. Analysis was performed using fixed effects models.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nFive trials were included, with 274 patients. The analysis was performed at two years after starting calcium and vitamin D. There was a significant weighted mean difference (WMD) between treatment and control groups in lumbar (WMD 2.6 (95% CI 0.7, 4.5), and radial bone mineral density (WMD 2.5 (95% CI 0.6, 4.4). The other outcome measures (femoral neck bone mass, fracture incidence, biochemical markers of bone resorption) were not significantly different.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant prevention of bone loss at the lumbar spine and forearm with vitamin D and calcium in corticosteroid treated patients. Because of low toxicity and cost all patients being started on corticosteroids should receive prophylactic therapy with calcium and vitamin D.",

We utilized a randomized, double\u2010blind, two\u2010period crossover trial with run\u2010in and washout periods of 2 weeks and treatment periods of 4 weeks duration. The setting was an Outpatient clinic in a secondary referral center. Subjects included 14 boys and 3 girls with a mean age of 11.7 (range, 6.1\u201314.4) years. Interventions included 15 \u03bcg (600 IU) 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D (cholecalciferol) in one tablet ABCDin\u00ae once daily in the morning. Primary outcome measures were: lower leg growth rate, serum osteocalcin, and serum markers of type I collagen turnover, i.e., the amino terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), the carboxy terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) (formation markers), and the carboxy terminal pyridinoline cross\u2010linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) (degradation markers). Secondary outcome measures were parameters of asthma control and serum 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D. Lower leg growth rate was 0.22 mm/week during vitamin D and 0.25 mm/week during placebo treatment (NS). Osteocalcin was 59.9 and 57.8 \u03bcg/l during vitamin D and placebo treatment, respectively, PINP 574 and 565 \u03bcg/l, PICP 381 and 382 \u03bcg/l, and ICTP 11.5 and 11.1 \u03bcg/l, respectively (NS). Serum 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D was 76.3 nmol/l and 48.2 nmol/l, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no statistically significant differences in measures of pulmonary function. In conclusion, administration of 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D does not affect short\u2010term growth or markers of bone turnover in children with asthma treated with inhaled dry\u2010powder budesonide 400 \u03bcg daily.

            "abstract": "Our objective was to assess whether administration of 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D to children with asthma treated with inhaled dry\u2010powder budesonide 400 \u03bcg daily affects short\u2010term growth or markers of bone turnover. We utilized a randomized, double\u2010blind, two\u2010period crossover trial with run\u2010in and washout periods of 2 weeks and treatment periods of 4 weeks duration. The setting was an Outpatient clinic in a secondary referral center. Subjects included 14 boys and 3 girls with a mean age of 11.7 (range, 6.1\u201314.4) years. Interventions included 15 \u03bcg (600 IU) 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D (cholecalciferol) in one tablet ABCDin\u00ae once daily in the morning. Primary outcome measures were: lower leg growth rate, serum osteocalcin, and serum markers of type I collagen turnover, i.e., the amino terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), the carboxy terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) (formation markers), and the carboxy terminal pyridinoline cross\u2010linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) (degradation markers). Secondary outcome measures were parameters of asthma control and serum 25\u2010OH\u2010vitamin D. Lower leg growth rate was 0.22 mm/week during vitamin D and 0.25 mm/week during placebo treatment (NS). Osteocalcin was 59.9 and 57.8 \u03bcg/l during vitamin D and placebo treatment, respectively, PINP 574 and 565 \u03bcg/l, PICP 381 and 382 \u03bcg/l, and ICTP 11.5 and 11.1 \u03bcg/l, respectively (NS).

            "abstract": "Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the first-line therapy for children with persistent asthma. These agents are particularly effective in reducing underlying airway inflammation, improving lung function, decreasing airway hyper-reactivity, and reducing intensity of symptoms in asthmatics. Chronic diseases, such as asthma, have growth-suppressing effects independent of the treatment, which inevitably complicates growth studies. One year studies showed a small, dose-dependent effect of most ICS on childhood growth, with some differences across various ICS molecules, and across individual children. Some ICS at the doses studied did not affect childhood growth when rigorous study designs were used. Most studies did not conform completely with the FDA guidance. The data on effects of childhood ICS use on final adult height are conflicting, but one recent well-designed study showed such an effect, clearly warranting additional studies. In spite of these measurable effects of ICS on childhood growth, it is important to understand that the safety profile of all ICS preparations, with focal anti-inflammatory effects on the lung, is significantly better than oral glucocorticoids.",

            "abstract": "Stimulant medications for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for the treatment of asthma are two classes of medications that are commonly prescribed in pediatrics. Among other adverse effects of these medications, growth attenuation has long been a focus of investigation. With stimulants, growth deficits of 1-1.4 cm/year have been observed in the short term, mainly in the first 2 years of treatment, in a dose-dependent manner. Long-term studies on stimulants have reported divergent effects on growth, with many studies showing no clinically significant height deficits by adulthood. The study that followed the largest cohort of children on stimulants, however, reported an overall adult height deficit of 1.29 cm in subjects who had received stimulant medications, with mean adult height deficit of 4.7 cm among those taking the medication consistently. With ICS use, mild growth suppression is seen in the short term (particularly in the first year of therapy) with growth rates reduced by 0.4-1.5 cm/year. Available current evidence indicates that the impact of ICS use on adult height is not clinically significant, with effects limited to 1.2 cm or less. There is significant individual variability in growth suppression with ICS use, with the specific pharmacologic agent, formulation, dose exposure, age, puberty, medication adherence, and timing of administration being important modifying factors. Based on currently available evidence, the therapeutic benefits of ICS for management of asthma and stimulant medications for management of ADHD outweigh the potential risk for growth suppression. Strategies to minimize growth attenuation and other potential adverse effects of these medications include using the lowest efficacious dose, frequent assessments and dose titration. Particular vigilance is essential with concomitant use of multiple medications that can attenuate growth and to evaluate for potential adrenal insufficiency from ICS use.",

            "abstract": "Stimulant medications for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for the treatment of asthma are two classes of medications that are commonly prescribed in pediatrics. Among other adverse effects of these medications, growth attenuation has long been a focus of investigation. With stimulants, growth deficits of 1-1.4 cm/year have been observed in the short term, mainly in the first 2 years of treatment, in a dose-dependent manner. Long-term studies on stimulants have reported divergent effects on growth, with many studies showing no clinically significant height deficits by adulthood. The study that followed the largest cohort of children on stimulants, however, reported an overall adult height deficit of 1.29 cm in subjects who had received stimulant medications, with mean adult height deficit of 4.7 cm among those taking the medication consistently. With ICS use, mild growth suppression is seen in the short term (particularly in the first year of therapy) with growth rates reduced by 0.4-1.5 cm/year. Available current evidence indicates that the impact of ICS use on adult height is not clinically significant, with effects limited to 1.2 cm or less. There is significant individual variability in growth suppression with ICS use, with the specific pharmacologic agent, formulation, dose exposure, age, puberty, medication adherence, and timing of administration being important modifying factors. Based on currently available evidence, the therapeutic benefits of ICS for management of asthma and stimulant medications for management of ADHD outweigh the potential risk for growth suppression. Strategies to minimize growth attenuation and other potential adverse effects of these medications include using the lowest efficacious dose, frequent assessments and dose titration. Particular vigilance is essential with concomitant use of multiple medications that can attenuate growth and to evaluate for potential adrenal insufficiency from ICS use.",
