            "abstract": "To assess whether ultrasound\u2010guided percutaneous acetic acid injection is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 60 patients with one to four HCCs smaller than 3 cm were entered onto a randomized controlled trial. Thirty\u2010one and 29 patients, respectively, were treated by percutaneous acetic acid injection using 50% acetic acid or by percutaneous ethanol injection using absolute ethanol. There were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, Child\u2010Pugh class, size of tumors, or number of tumors between the two groups. When there was no evidence of viable HCC from biopsy, plain and helical dynamic computed tomography, or angiography, the treatment was considered successful and was discontinued. All original tumors were treated successfully by either therapy. However, 8% of 38 tumors treated with percutaneous acetic acid injection and 37% of 35 tumors treated with percutaneous ethanol injection developed a local recurrence (P < .001) during the follow\u2010up periods of 29 \u00b1 8 months and 23 \u00b1 10 months, respectively. The 1\u2010 and 2\u2010year survival rates were 100% and 92% in percutaneous acetic acid injection and 83% and 63% in percutaneous ethanol injection (P = .0017). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed that treatment was an independent predictor of survival. The risk ratio of percutaneous acetic acid injection versus percutaneous ethanol injection was 0.120 (range, 0.027\u20100.528;P = .0050). In conclusion, percutaneous acetic acid injection is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of small HCC.",

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of the impact of medical treatments on survival. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published as full papers assessing survival for primary treatments of HCC were included. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CANCERLIT, and a manual search from 1978 to May 2002 were used. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end point was response to treatment. Estimates of effect were calculated according to the random effects model. Sensitivity analysis included methodological quality. We identified 61 randomized trials, but only 14 met the criteria to perform a meta\u2010analysis assessing arterial embolization (7 trials, 545 patients) or tamoxifen (7 trials, 898 patients).

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of the impact of medical treatments on survival. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published as full papers assessing survival for primary treatments of HCC were included. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CANCERLIT, and a manual search from 1978 to May 2002 were used. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end point was response to treatment. Estimates of effect were calculated according to the random effects model. Sensitivity analysis included methodological quality. We identified 61 randomized trials, but only 14 met the criteria to perform a meta\u2010analysis assessing arterial embolization (7 trials, 545 patients) or tamoxifen (7 trials, 898 patients). Arterial embolization improved 2\u2010year survival compared with control (odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32\u20100.89; P = .017).

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of the impact of medical treatments on survival.

Tamoxifen showed no antitumoral effect and no survival benefits (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.36\u20101.13; P = .13), and only low\u2010quality scale trials suggested 1\u2010year improvement in survival. In conclusion, chemoembolization improves survival of patients with unresectable HCC and may become the standard treatment.

MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CANCERLIT, and a manual search from 1978 to May 2002 were used. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end point was response to treatment.

We identified 61 randomized trials, but only 14 met the criteria to perform a meta\u2010analysis assessing arterial embolization (7 trials, 545 patients) or tamoxifen (7 trials, 898 patients).

            "abstract": "There is no standard treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival benefits derived from medical interventions are controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of the impact of medical treatments on survival. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published as full papers assessing survival for primary treatments of HCC were included. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CANCERLIT, and a manual search from 1978 to May 2002 were used. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end point was response to treatment. Estimates of effect were calculated according to the random effects model. Sensitivity analysis included methodological quality. We identified 61 randomized trials, but only 14 met the criteria to perform a meta\u2010analysis assessing arterial embolization (7 trials, 545 patients) or tamoxifen (7 trials, 898 patients). Arterial embolization improved 2\u2010year survival compared with control (odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32\u20100.89; P = .017). Sensitivity analysis showed a significant benefit of chemoembolization with cisplatin or doxorubicin (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20\u20100.88) but none with embolization alone (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.29\u20101.20). Overall, treatment induced objective responses in 35% of patients (range, 16%\u201061%). Tamoxifen showed no antitumoral effect and no survival benefits (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.36\u20101.13; P = .13), and only low\u2010quality scale trials suggested 1\u2010year improvement in survival. In conclusion, chemoembolization improves survival of patients with unresectable HCC and may become the standard treatment. Treatment with tamoxifen does not modify the survival of patients with advanced disease.",

            "abstract": "Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib (SOR) are well-established treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of SOR combined with TACE in the treatment of patients with TACE-refractory, advanced-stage HCC. Methods This retrospective study included 61 patients with TACE-refractory advanced HCC. Patients were divided into TACE + SOR (n=30) and TACE (n=31) treatment groups. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two groups. Results Compared with TACE alone, the 5-year OS and TTP were prolonged in the TACE + SOR group (median OS: 17.9 vs 7.1 months, P<0.001; median TTP: 9.3 vs 3.4 months, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that Child\u2013Pugh class A (hazard ratio [HR], 0.234; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.092\u20130.595), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 (HR, 0.355; 95% CI, 0.153\u20130.826), alpha-fetoprotein <400 ng/mL (HR, 0.349; 95% CI, 0.177\u20130.689), and TACE + SOR treatment (HR, 0.151; 95% CI, 0.071\u20130.322) were independent, positive predictive factors of OS. Conclusion The OS and TTP in the combined treatment group were significantly improved when compared with the TACE group. However, no significant difference in DCR was found between these two groups. While no AEs occurred in the TACE group, two patients in the TACE + SOR group experienced severe AEs which were effectively mitigated by lowering the dose of SOR. Thus, SOR in combination with TACE is a safe and effective treatment for advanced-stage, prior-TACE-resistant HCC.",

Molecular targeting agent, sorafenib, is the main therapeutic option for antitumor therapy of advanced HCC, but it is currently too expensive for the public and its therapeutic effect does not satisfy initial expectation. Therefore, it is important to develop more effective molecular targeted therapeutic strategies for advanced HCC. Materials and methods The antitumor effects of sorafenib or ARQ-197, an antagonist of c-MET (tyrosine-protein kinase Met or hepatocyte growth factor receptor), were examined by MTT or in murine tumor model. The effect of ARQ-197 on epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) or multidrug resistance (MDR) was examined by quantitative real-time PCR for the expression of related genes. The clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells was detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Results ARQ-197 treatment enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. Mechanistic studies indicated that ARQ-197 inhibited the expression of EMT- and MDR-related genes. Moreover, ARQ-197 treatment decelerated the clearance of sorafenib in cultured HCC cells and subcutaneous HCC tumors in nude mice. Conclusion In the present work, our data suggested that ARQ-197 decelerated the clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells and enhanced the antitumor effect of sorafenib.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately one in six deaths. Due to its critical role in cell growth/proliferation, one of the most well-known cancer-promoting proteins is MYC. Because cancer cells need MYC to grow, MYC is usually overactive in human cancers. However, despite decades of research, drugs targeting MYC continue to remain elusive. Notably, MYC requires other proteins to function properly. Our investigations into a protein named MTBP revealed that it associates with MYC and helps its pro-growth and cancer promoting function. Here, we discuss MTBP and review evidence showing MTBP is a critical partner for MYC, although the full extent of this partnership remains unresolved. We also discuss the role of MTBP in cancer, as MTBP levels are elevated in many human cancers and is often associated with reduced cancer patient survival. Additionally, we will discuss the inhibition of cancer cell growth and induction of cancer cell death by decreasing MTBP levels, indicating MTBP may represent a new cancer drug target and a way of indirectly targeting MYC. Abstract The oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC (MYC) is highly conserved across species and is frequently overexpressed or dysregulated in human cancers. MYC regulates a wide range of critical cellular and oncogenic activities including proliferation, metabolism, metastasis, apoptosis, and differentiation by transcriptionally activating or repressing the expression of a large number of genes. This activity of MYC is not carried out in isolation, instead relying on its association with a myriad of protein cofactors. We determined that MDM Two Binding Protein (MTBP) indirectly binds MYC and is a novel MYC transcriptional cofactor. MTBP promotes MYC-mediated transcriptional activity, proliferation, and cellular transformation by binding in a protein complex with MYC at MYC-bound promoters. This discovery provided critical context for data linking MTBP to aging as well as a rapidly expanding body of evidence demonstrating MTBP is overexpressed in many human malignancies, is often linked to poor patient outcomes, and is necessary for cancer cell survival. As such, MTBP represents a novel and potentially broad reaching oncologic drug target, particularly when MYC is dysregulated. Here we have reviewed the discovery of MTBP and the initial controversy with its function as well as its associations with proliferation, MYC, DNA replication, aging, and human cancer.",
