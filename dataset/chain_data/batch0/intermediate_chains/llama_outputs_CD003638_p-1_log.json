CHCs serve patients who are uninsured, underinsured, or have a very low income. Many of these patients are at great risk for safety because of cultural or language barriers.\n\nStarting in 2000, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services awarded clinical pharmacy demonstration grants to 18 CHC networks. The purpose of these grants was to demonstrate that access to medications and comprehensive pharmacy services results in an improvement in the health status of patients by either starting pharmacies to provide affordable medications through 340B Drug Pricing Programs2 or expanding medication assistance programs (MAPs) by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Another goal was to determine the impact of pharmacists on diabetes and its comorbidities in these settings. In many cases, CHC patients were provided access to pharmacist care for the first time. These networks were composed of HRSA-funded health centers, a college of pharmacy, and sometimes other organizations.\n\nMathematica Policy Research, provided the overall evaluation of these grants and prepared a report to the HRSA.3 Mathematica highlighted five of the clinical pharmacy demonstration projects (CPDPs) in their report. Each CHC project was unique, but all provided certain components of disease management, expanded patient access to medications, medication formulary activities, and training of pharmacy students or residents. The highlighted projects had at least three characteristics in common: positive diabetes disease management clinical data, a large number of patients given pharmacist-provided care, and good retention \u2026",

These centers are federally supported clinics that provide primary care services for > 11 million underserved patients.1 CHCs were established in 1965 under the Public Health Services Act, through a federal grant program. CHCs serve patients who are uninsured, underinsured, or have a very low income. Many of these patients are at great risk for safety because of cultural or language barriers.\n\nStarting in 2000, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services awarded clinical pharmacy demonstration grants to 18 CHC networks. The purpose of these grants was to demonstrate that access to medications and comprehensive pharmacy services results in an improvement in the health status of patients by either starting pharmacies to provide affordable medications through 340B Drug Pricing Programs2 or expanding medication assistance programs (MAPs) by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Another goal was to determine the impact of pharmacists on diabetes and its comorbidities in these settings. In many cases, CHC patients were provided access to pharmacist care for the first time. These networks were composed of HRSA-funded health centers, a college of pharmacy, and sometimes other organizations.\n\nMathematica Policy Research, provided the overall evaluation of these grants and prepared a report to the HRSA.3 Mathematica highlighted five of the clinical pharmacy demonstration projects (CPDPs) in their report. Each CHC project was unique, but all provided certain components of disease management, expanded patient access to medications, medication formulary activities, and training of pharmacy students or residents. The highlighted projects had at least three characteristics in common: positive diabetes disease management clinical data, a large number of patients given pharmacist-provided care, and good retention \u2026",

The paper also mentions the Health Resources and Services Administration grant, which is the same grant that funded the collaborative agreement between the University of Utah College of Pharmacy and Utah CHCs in the source paper."
