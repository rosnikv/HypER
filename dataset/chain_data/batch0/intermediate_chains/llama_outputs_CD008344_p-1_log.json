We evaluated the effects of immunonutrition before hepatectomy on perioperative management. This study was performed as a randomized controlled trial. Patients expected to undergo segmentectomy or more extensive hepatectomy for liver tumors were randomized to immunonutrition (IM) and control (C) groups each consisting of 13 patients. The IM group was given 750 ml of IMPACT in addition to half-size hospital meals orally from 5 days before to the day before surgery, and the C group was given conventional hospital meals. The blood level of eicosapentaenoic acid was elevated preoperatively in all patients of the IM group. The white blood cell count and interleukin 6 levels, which are indices of postoperative inflammation, were significantly lower in the IM group. As regards liver function, postoperative increases in the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransaminase levels were slightly suppressed in the IM group. No significant difference was noted in postoperative complications or duration of postoperative hospital stay. In patients undergoing hepatectomy, preoperative immunonutrition reduced inflammation and protected against liver dysfunction.",

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of peri-operative immunonutrition on clinical outcomes and liver function in patients undergoing liver transplantation.\n\n\nMETHODS AND STUDY DESIGN\nThe Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and google scholar were searched to identify all available randomized controlled studies which compared peri-operative immunonutrition support (glutamine, \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, arginine and ribonucleic acids) with standard nutrition. The data analysis was performed using Revman 5.2 software.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 501 patients were included. Peri-operative immunonutrition significantly reduced the risk of infectious complications (RR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.98, p=0.04) and shortened the postoperative hospital stay [weighted mean difference (WMD): -3.89; 95% CI: -7.42 to -0.36; p=0.03]. Furthermore, perioperative immunonutrition improved liver function by decreasing the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the blood (WMD: -25.4; 95% CI: -39.9 to -10.9, p=0.0006).

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of peri-operative immunonutrition on clinical outcomes and liver function in patients undergoing liver transplantation.\n\n\nMETHODS AND STUDY DESIGN\nThe Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and google scholar were searched to identify all available randomized controlled studies which compared peri-operative immunonutrition support (glutamine, \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, arginine and ribonucleic acids) with standard nutrition. The data analysis was performed using Revman 5.2 software.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 501 patients were included. Peri-operative immunonutrition significantly reduced the risk of infectious complications (RR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.98, p=0.04) and shortened the postoperative hospital stay [weighted mean difference (WMD): -3.89; 95% CI: -7.42 to -0.36; p=0.03]. Furthermore, perioperative immunonutrition improved liver function by decreasing the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the blood (WMD: -25.4; 95% CI: -39.9 to -10.9, p=0.0006). However, we did not find statistically significant differences in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB) and direct bilirubin (DB) levels.

            "abstract": "Background. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal, evidence-based, program of care developed to minimize the response to surgical stress, associated with reduced perioperative morbidity and hospital stay. This study presents the specific ERAS Society recommendations for liver transplantation (LT) based on the best available evidence and on expert consensus Methods. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched in April 2019 for published and ongoing randomized clinical trials on LT in the last 15 y. Studies were selected by 5 independent reviewers and were eligible if focusing on each validated ERAS item in the area of adult LT. An e-Delphi method was used with an extended interdisciplinary panel of experts to validate the final recommendations. Results. Forty-three articles were included in the systematic review. A consensus was reached among experts after the second round. Patients should be screened for malnutrition and treated whenever possible. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage may be omitted, and early extubation should be considered. Early oral intake, mobilization, and multimodal-balanced analgesia are recommended. Conclusions. The current ERAS recommendations were elaborated based on the best available evidence and endorsed by the e-Delphi method. Nevertheless, prospective studies need to confirm the clinical use of the suggested protocol.",
