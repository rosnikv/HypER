            "abstract": "An 80-year-old man with a 4-year history of atrial fibrillation has hypertension and occasional lower back and knee pain, but he feels well overall. He does not drink or smoke. He has had echocardiography but has never undergone a trial of cardioversion. Except for an irregularly irregular pulse at a rate of 90 beats/min and crepitus of his knees, the patient's physical examination is unremarkable. His mental function is good, with a score of 28 (out of 30) on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (1). Benefits and Risks of Prescribing Warfarin in an Elderly Patient Who Has Atrial Fibrillation What Are the Benefits of Prescribing Warfarin? In a recent meta-analysis of the atrial fibrillation trials, Hart and colleagues (2) found that compared with no antithrombotic therapy, adjusted-dose warfarin prevents 62% of strokes and aspirin prevents 22% of strokes. How these relative risk reductions translate into absolute benefit depends on the underlying risk for stroke. The stroke risk, in turn, depends on the presence or absence of specific comorbid conditions: previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease (including mitral stenosis and heart failure), and advanced age (3-5). The patient described here is very elderly and has hypertension. The incidence of stroke in this patient would be at least 4% per year without antithrombotic therapy (3, 5), even if his echocardiogram is normal. Aspirin reduces this annual rate to approximately 3.6% (6), while warfarin would reduce it to less than 2% per year (2). Although data from available clinical trials were primarily collected from patients who were younger than 80 years of age, a recent observational study suggests that warfarin also benefits octogenarians who have atrial fibrillation (7). Although warfarin is likely to benefit patients who have an annual stroke rate of 4% or greater, the net benefit will depend on the risk for hemorrhage and on personal preferences (8). We focus on these two factors before deciding whether to offer warfarin therapy. What Are the Risks of Prescribing Warfarin? The major risk of warfarin therapy is hemorrhage. The risk for serious hemorrhage increases with the following factors: recent hemorrhage, alcoholic binge drinking, renal insufficiency, liver disease, use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and cancer (9-13). Additional risk factors for hemorrhage may include advanced age, thrombocytopenia, previous stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, and nonwhite ethnicity (9-11, 14). Thus, this patient's only identifiable risk factor for hemorrhage is advanced age. Although there are exceptions (15-17), many investigators have found that older patients who receive warfarin have higher rates of major hemorrhage than do younger patients taking the same regimens (9, 11, 14, 18-21). In the atrial fibrillation trials, the annual rate of major hemorrhage averaged 1.4% for patients who were randomly assigned to adjusted-dose warfarin therapy (3, 22). Because this patient is an octogenarian and is not part of a clinical trial, his annual risk for major hemorrhage with warfarin therapy would be approximately 3% to 4% (14, 15)nearly 3% (per year) higher than the 0.5% (6) to 1% (3) annual rate of major hemorrhage associated with aspirin therapy. The patient is currently taking low-dose aspirin, digoxin, and extended-release nifedipine; he has never received warfarin. We discuss the risks and benefits of substituting warfarin therapy with him, including the need for regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR). We order baseline testing of INR, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and measurement of digoxin level. We arrange to obtain his old medical records. The patient returns for follow-up 1 week later. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg; his pulse is 95 beats/min and irregularly irregular. The remainder of his physical examination is unremarkable. His old medical records reveal previous screening flexible sigmoidoscopy and measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone level, both of which yielded normal findings. The patient's new laboratory test results are normal except for a slightly elevated creatinine level. His previous echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normal cardiac valves, and a slightly enlarged left atrium. How Should the Risk and Benefits of Prescribing Warfarin Be Weighed in the Setting of Atrial Fibrillation? For this patient, who has a 4% stroke risk without antithrombotic therapy and a 3% to 4% risk for hemorhage with warfarin, warfarin is likely to prolong his quality-adjusted survival by approximately 0.1 quality-adjusted life-year more than aspirin would (22). However, this estimate is sensitive to the patient's preferences (8). We begin to explore the patient's preferences by summarizing the benefits and risks of warfarin therapy as compared to aspirinwarfarin would reduce his stroke rate by 2% per year and increase his rate of major hemorrhage by 2% to 3% per year. After discussion, the patient understands that a stroke is usually much more debilitating than a hemorrhage, and he chooses to take warfarin and undergo regular INR monitoring. What Items Should Be Discussed with a Patient Who Is Starting Warfarin Therapy? We review topics on a checklist (Table) and provide the patient with written material from one of the manufacturers of warfarin. Table. Checklist of Information To Review with Patients When Prescribing Warfarin What INR Should Be Targeted in This 80-Year-Old Man with Atrial Fibrillation? Five recent randomized, controlled trials (23-27) support guidelines that recommend a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 (28-30). The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III investigators (23) found a 1.9% rate of stroke and systemic embolism in 523 high-risk participants randomly assigned to adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR, 2.0 to 3.0) and a 7.9% rate in participants randomly assigned to a combination of mini-dose warfarin (target INR, 1.2 to 1.5) and aspirin (325 mg). In a smaller study, Pengo and colleagues (24) also found a significantly lower stroke rate in participants randomly assigned to warfarin adjusted to an INR of 2 to 3 rather than to mini-dose warfarin. In contrast, three other small randomized, controlled trials found no statistically significant advantage to targeting INRs greater than 2.0 rather than lower levels of anticoagulation (25-27). When taken together, however, these three studies suggest that warfarin therapy adjusted to an INR greater than 2.0 is associated with a 33% relative risk reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke compared with mini-dose warfarin: Twelve strokes occurred in the 356 patients randomly assigned to have an INR greater than 2.0, whereas 18 strokes occurred in the 349 patients assigned to have a lower INR. On the basis of these five trials and other important studies (31-33), we conclude that the optimal INR for patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is at least 2.0; the optimal INR remains controversial, especially in an 80-year-old patient (34). For this patient, we choose a target INR of 2.5. Rate Control and Rhythm Control in Atrial Fibrillation Should Digoxin Therapy Be Continued for This Patient? Digoxin does not reliably control ventricular response during exertion in patients who have atrial fibrillation (35-37). For this patient, who has left ventricular hypertrophy and a heart rate of 95 beats/min, we discontinue digoxin and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker therapies and prescribe atenolol instead (37) . Should This Patient Undergo Cardioversion? Compared with a younger, symptomatic patient with new-onset atrial fibrillation, this octogenarian with chronic atrial fibrillation has relatively little to gain from electrical or chemical cardioversion (35, 36). He is already asymptomatic, and attempted cardioversion would probably fail because sinus rhythm becomes increasingly difficult to restore and maintain with advancing age and longer duration of atrial fibrillation (36, 38, 39). On the basis of this information, we elect not to pursue cardioversion at this time. Initiation of Warfarin Therapy When Initiating Warfarin Therapy, What Dose Should Be Prescribed? Most patients can start warfarin therapy with a 5-mg dose: Randomized trials have found that patients were more likely to have a therapeutic INR 3 to 5 days after starting warfarin therapy with a 5-mg rather than a 10-mg dose (39-41) because the higher dose often led to high INRs (40-42). The patient begins warfarin therapy with a single 5-mg dose. Because advanced age is associated with lower steady-state warfarin dose requirements (43-46), an octogenarian who begins warfarin therapy with a 5-mg dose should have his daily dose based on the INR response measured during the first days of therapy. Other factors known to be associated with lower steady-state warfarin dose requirements include mutations in the cytochrome P450 isozymes (47-49), low body weight (45, 50), low serum albumin level (51), cardiac failure (46), liver disease (52), or concomitant use of certain medications (53). In patients who are very elderly or who have one or more of these factors, many experts initiate warfarin therapy with an initial dose of 2 to 4 mg rather than 5 mg (54-56). Twenty hours after the 5-mg dose, the patient's INR is 1.25. After Giving the First Warfarin Dose, How Is the Next Dose Selected? The second dose should be selected cautiously: The primary concern is giving too high a dose, causing the INR to increase to 5 or more. Successful dosing requires letting sufficient time pass between the first dose of warfarin and the subsequent INR measurement and selecting doses of warfarin tailored to the increase in INR. The common practice of administering warfarin in the evening and measuring INR in the early morning does not allow sufficient time for the warfarin effect to become manif",

Objective: To estimate the percentage of stroke survivors receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs and to identify factors associated with such treatment. Design: Cross sectional retrospective cohort study. Methods: Data were analysed from a large collaborative observational study, the Italian \u201csilver network\u201d home care project, which collected data (from 1997 to 2001) on patients admitted to home care programmes (n = 5372). Twenty two home health agencies participated in evaluating the implementation of the minimum dataset for home care (MDS-HC) instrument. For the present study, 648 individuals with a diagnosis of stroke were selected and the initial MDS-HC assessment reported. Results: 70% of stroke survivors did not receive any antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs (95% confidence interval (CI), 66.5 to 73.5). Among all age categories, aspirin and ticlopidine were the two most commonly prescribed drugs. Living alone (odds ratio (OR), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.89)), dependency in activities of daily living (0.66 (0.40 to 0.99)), cognitive impairment (0.58 (0.38 to 0.86)), and low educational level (0.58 (0.34 to 0.98)) were associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving secondary stroke prevention treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease were associated with the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment. Conclusions: Negative attitudes among physicians with respect to secondary stroke prevention are prevalent and reinforce the need for increased awareness of existing data on the risks and benefits for elderly individuals. Social problems and functional impairment may be issues concerning physicians when deciding whether or not the risks of treatment exceed the benefit.",

            "abstract": "Background: Patients who suffer a cerebrovascular event are at high risk of a recurrence. Secondary prevention is crucial in reducing the burden of cerebrovascular disease. Objective: To estimate the percentage of stroke survivors receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs and to identify factors associated with such treatment. Design: Cross sectional retrospective cohort study. Methods: Data were analysed from a large collaborative observational study, the Italian \u201csilver network\u201d home care project, which collected data (from 1997 to 2001) on patients admitted to home care programmes (n = 5372). Twenty two home health agencies participated in evaluating the implementation of the minimum dataset for home care (MDS-HC) instrument. For the present study, 648 individuals with a diagnosis of stroke were selected and the initial MDS-HC assessment reported. Results: 70% of stroke survivors did not receive any antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs (95% confidence interval (CI), 66.5 to 73.5). Among all age categories, aspirin and ticlopidine were the two most commonly prescribed drugs. Living alone (odds ratio (OR), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.89)), dependency in activities of daily living (0.66 (0.40 to 0.99)), cognitive impairment (0.58 (0.38 to 0.86)), and low educational level (0.58 (0.34 to 0.98)) were associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving secondary stroke prevention treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease were associated with the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment. Conclusions: Negative attitudes among physicians with respect to secondary stroke prevention are prevalent and reinforce the need for increased awareness of existing data on the risks and benefits for elderly individuals. Social problems and functional impairment may be issues concerning physicians when deciding whether or not the risks of treatment exceed the benefit.",

            "abstract": "Background: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the only treatment that has shown a significant benefit to reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with ischemic stroke and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, OAC is still underused, even at discharge from neurological centers. The objective of this study was to identify the reasons underlying the prescription of OAC at discharge after an ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF. Methods: We investigated the reasons why ischemic stroke patients with NVAF were not treated with OAC at discharge from 40 centers located in 5 European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, and Portugal). Results: Of 320 ischemic stroke survivors at discharge, 186 (58.1%) received OAC, while 260 (81.3%) patients were theoretically eligible according to guidelines and the absence of contraindications. There were significant differences between countries and the logistic regression analysis found being already under OAC before stroke, having no leukoaraiosis, having no potential contraindication, being younger than 75 years, being married and suffering from angina pectoris as independent predictors of being discharged under OAC. Conclusion: This study suggests that besides patient-related factors, the prescription of OAC is also significantly influenced by the social environment and national practices.",

We therefore sought to investigate the prescription patterns at discharge, adherence and quality of OAC in cerebrovascular disease patients with AF. Methods: Consecutive ischemic stroke (IS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients were prospectively documented in 11 German stroke centers. A central telephone follow-up after 1\u20132 years assessed the current antithrombotic medication and results of coagulation checks. Results: Of 1,463 surviving patients with AF, 30.5% were discharged on OAC and 13.9% on high-dose heparin. Of 329 AF patients discharged on OAC and with consent for follow-up, 88.7% of surviving patients were still on OAC at the follow-up. Of these, 52.7% reported coagulation values out of the therapeutic range during the preceding 3 months. A recurrent IS was seen in 9 patients (2.1%/year) and an intracranial hemorrhage in 2. Conclusion: We found an important underuse of OAC following TIA or IS mainly in older patients and with greater stroke-related disability. Although the reported coagulation checks showed an only moderate rate within therapeutic ranges, safety and efficacy of OAC in this cohort seem comparable to previous randomized and observational trials in AF patients.",

This study aimed to assess the performance of four IS prognostic scales in a Brazilian population. Method We evaluated data of IS patients admitted at Hospital Paulistano, a Joint Commission International certified primary stroke center. In-hospital mortality and modified Rankin score at discharge were defined as the outcome measures. The performance of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Stroke Prognostication Using Age and NIHSS (SPAN-100), Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL), and Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) were compared. Results Two hundred six patients with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 67.58 \u00b1 15.5 years, being 55.3% male, were included. The four scales were significantly and independently associated functional outcome. Only THRIVE was associated with in-hospital mortality. With area under the curve THRIVE and NIHSS were the scales with better performance for functional outcome and THRIVE had the best performance for mortality.

To validate and propose a Hospital Mobility Scale (HMS) for ischemic stroke patients as well as to evaluate the HMS as a prognostic indicator. Methods. This study was performed in 2 phases: in the first, we developed the HMS content, and in the second, we defined its score and evaluated its psychometric properties. We performed a longitudinal prospective study consisting of 2 cohorts (derivation and validation cohorts). The data were collected in a stroke unit, and the following scales were applied during hospitalization: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale to quantify stroke severity and the HMS to verify the degree of mobility. The primary outcome was the proportion of unfavorable functional outcomes, defined as a modified Barthel Index of <95. Results. We defined 3 tasks for HMS: sitting, standing, and gait. In the derivation cohort, the HMS presented an accuracy of 84.5% measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI = 78.3-90.7; P < .001), whereas in the validation cohort the accuracy was 87.8% (95% CI = 81.9%-93.7%; P < .001). The HMS presented a large standardized effect size (1.41) and excellent interexaminer agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.962; 95% CI = 0.917-0.983; P < .001). Conclusion. The HMS was able to predict accurately the functional outcome of poststroke patients, presented excellent interexaminer agreement, and was sensitive in detecting changes.",

            "abstract": "Background. Stroke patients present restriction of mobility in the acute phase, and the use of a simple and specific scale can be useful to guide rehabilitation. Objective. To validate and propose a Hospital Mobility Scale (HMS) for ischemic stroke patients as well as to evaluate the HMS as a prognostic indicator. Methods. This study was performed in 2 phases: in the first, we developed the HMS content, and in the second, we defined its score and evaluated its psychometric properties. We performed a longitudinal prospective study consisting of 2 cohorts (derivation and validation cohorts). The data were collected in a stroke unit, and the following scales were applied during hospitalization: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale to quantify stroke severity and the HMS to verify the degree of mobility. The primary outcome was the proportion of unfavorable functional outcomes, defined as a modified Barthel Index of <95. Results. We defined 3 tasks for HMS: sitting, standing, and gait. In the derivation cohort, the HMS presented an accuracy of 84.5% measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI = 78.3-90.7; P < .001), whereas in the validation cohort the accuracy was 87.8% (95% CI = 81.9%-93.7%; P < .001). The HMS presented a large standardized effect size (1.41) and excellent interexaminer agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.962; 95% CI = 0.917-0.983; P < .001). Conclusion. The HMS was able to predict accurately the functional outcome of poststroke patients, presented excellent interexaminer agreement, and was sensitive in detecting changes.",

Method A prospective cohort of post-stroke individuals was recruited from the Stroke Unit of the Roberto Santos General Hospital (UAVC-HGRS). All included individuals were aged over 18 years, received a diagnosis of ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging and resided in the city of Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). Following discharge from the stroke unit, the individuals themselves, or their responsible parties, were contacted by telephone to schedule a home visit no less than three months after discharge. All subjects were examined in their homes, at which time the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) was also applied. A robust linear regression model was used to assess community reintegration using CIQ score as the outcome variable. Results A total of 124 individuals effectively fulfilled the eligibility criteria: 51.6% were females, the median (IQR) age was 63(53\u201369) years, 82.3% were non-white, 53.2% were married, the median (IQR) of years of schooling was 6 (4\u201312) and family income averaged two minimum monthly wages. Investigated individuals presented a median (IQR) NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 7 (4\u201312). Multivariate linear regression identified the following independent predictors of community integration: age (\u03b2 = -0.095; 95% CI = -0.165 to -0.025; p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (\u03b2 = -2.348; 95% CI = -4.125 to -0.571; p = 0.010), smoking habit (\u03b2 = -2.951; 95% CI = -5.081 to -0.821; p = 0.007), functional capacity upon hospital discharge (\u03b2 = 0.168; 95% CI = 0.093 to 0.242; p = <0.001) and stroke severity (\u03b2 = -0.163; CI = -0.318 to -0.009); p = 0.038). Conclusions Regardless of length of time since stroke, individuals present restrictions that compromise their reintegration into their respective communities. The demographic, clinical and functional factors identified herein as potential predictors should be considered when conducting regular follow-up, as well as in the rehabilitation of individuals after stroke with the purpose to identify the interventions necessary to optimize their reintegration into the community.",

            "abstract": "The importance of assessing the collateral status (CS) in patients with ischaemic stroke (IS) has repeatedly been emphasised in clinical guidelines. Various publications offer qualitative or semiquantitative scales with gradations corresponding to the different extents of the collaterals, visualised mostly on the basis of CTA images. However, information on their inter-rater reliability is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the inter-rater reliability of the scales for collateral assessment. CTA images of 158 patients in the acute period of IS were used in the study. The assessment of CS was performed by two experts using three methodologies: the modified Tan scale, the Miteff scale, and the Rosenthal scale. Cohen\u2019s kappa, weighted kappa and Krippendorff\u2019s alpha were used as reliability measures. For the modified Tan scale and the Miteff and Rosenthal scales, the weighted kappa values were 0.72, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively. Although the best measure of consistency was found for the modified Tan scale, no statistically significant differences were revealed among the scales. The impact of the CS on the degree of neurological deficit at discharge was shown for the modified Tan and Rosenthal scales. In conclusion, the analysis showed a moderate inter-rater reliability of the three scales, but was not able to distinguish the best one among them.",
