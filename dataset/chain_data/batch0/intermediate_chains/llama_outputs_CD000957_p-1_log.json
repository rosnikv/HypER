            "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokine activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signal transduction pathway is a critical event in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Under normal conditions, JAK/STAT signaling reflects the influence of negative regulators of JAK/STAT, exemplified by the suppressor of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STAT. However, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) both of these regulators are dysfunctional. Thus, continuous activation of JAK/STAT signaling in RA synovial joints results in the elevated level of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression, increased frequency of apoptotic chondrocytes and most prominently \u2018apoptosis resistance\u2019 in the inflamed synovial tissue. Tofacitinib, a JAK small molecule inhibitor, with selectivity for JAK2/JAK3 was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the therapy of RA. Importantly, tofacitinib has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy for RA in the post-US FDA-approval surveillance period. Of note, the success of tofacitinib has spurred the development of JAK1, JAK2 and other JAK3-selective small molecule inhibitors, some of which have also entered the clinical setting, whereas other JAK inhibitors are currently being evaluated in RA clinical trials.",

            "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokine activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signal transduction pathway is a critical event in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Under normal conditions, JAK/STAT signaling reflects the influence of negative regulators of JAK/STAT, exemplified by the suppressor of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STAT. However, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) both of these regulators are dysfunctional. Thus, continuous activation of JAK/STAT signaling in RA synovial joints results in the elevated level of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression, increased frequency of apoptotic chondrocytes and most prominently \u2018apoptosis resistance\u2019 in the inflamed synovial tissue. Tofacitinib, a JAK small molecule inhibitor, with selectivity for JAK2/JAK3 was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the therapy of RA. Importantly, tofacitinib has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy for RA in the post-US FDA-approval surveillance period. Of note, the success of tofacitinib has spurred the development of JAK1, JAK2 and other JAK3-selective small molecule inhibitors, some of which have also entered the clinical setting, whereas other JAK inhibitors are currently being evaluated in RA clinical trials.",

Methods In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase III study, patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, peficitinib 100 mg once daily or peficitinib 150 mg once daily with MTX for 52 weeks. Based on baseline randomisation, at week 12, non-responders receiving placebo were switched to peficitinib until the end of treatment; the remaining patients were switched to peficitinib at week 28.

            "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor peficitinib versus placebo in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase III study, patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, peficitinib 100 mg once daily or peficitinib 150 mg once daily with MTX for 52 weeks. Based on baseline randomisation, at week 12, non-responders receiving placebo were switched to peficitinib until the end of treatment; the remaining patients were switched to peficitinib at week 28. Primary efficacy variables were American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response rate at week 12/early termination (ET) and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score (mTSS) at week 28/ET. Results 519 patients were randomised and treated. Significantly more (p<0.001) peficitinib (58.6%, 100 mg; 64.4%, 150 mg) than placebo (21.8%) recipients achieved ACR20 response at week 12/ET. Significantly lower (p<0.001) mean changes from baseline in mTSS at week 28/ET occurred in peficitinib (1.62, 100 mg; 1.03, 150 mg) than placebo (3.37) recipients. Peficitinib was associated with haematological and biochemical parameter changes, and increased incidence of serious infections and herpes zoster-related disease. One death from suicide occurred in a patient in the placebo group after switching to peficitinib 100 mg. Conclusions In Japanese patients with RA and inadequate response to MTX, peficitinib demonstrated significant superiority versus placebo in reducing RA symptoms and suppressing joint destruction. Peficitinib had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with no new safety signals compared with other JAK inhibitors. Trial registration number NCT02305849.",

Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled from 2007 until October 2020. Reported HZ events were assigned to ongoing treatments or those terminated within 1\u2009month prior to the HZ event. Exposure-adjusted event rates (EAERs) of HZ were calculated per 1000 patient years (py) and adjusted HRs with 95% CIs computed. Inverse probability weights (IPW) were used to adjust for confounding by indication. Results Data of 13\u2009991 patients (62\u2009958 py) were analysed, with 559\u2009HZ events reported in 533 patients.

            "abstract": "Objective Longitudinal clinical registry-infrastructures such as Anti-Rheumatic Therapies in Sweden (ARTIS) allow simultaneous comparison of the safety of individual immunomodulatory drugs used in clinical practice, with consistent definitions of treatment cohorts, follow-up and outcomes. Our objective was to assess and compare incidence rates of key safety outcomes for individual targeted synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/ts DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), updating previous reports and including newer treatments including Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi). Methods Nationwide register-based cohort study including all patients with RA in Sweden registered as starting any b/tsDMARD 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2020, followed until 30 June 2021 (N=20\u2009117). The incidence rates of selected outcomes, identified through national healthcare registers, were compared between individual b/tsDMARDs, adjusted for confounding by demographics, RA disease characteristics and comorbidity. Results There were marked differences in treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (rates per 1000 person-years ranged from 18 on rituximab to 57 on tofacitinib), but few significant differences were observed for the serious adverse events under study. Neither cardiovascular events nor general serious infections were more frequent on baricitinib or tofacitinib versus bDMARDs, but JAKi were associated with higher rates of hospital-treated herpes zoster (HR vs etanercept, 3.82 (95% CI 2.05 to 7.09) and 4.00 (1.59 to 10.06)). Low number of events limited some comparisons, in particular for sarilumab and tofacitinib. Conclusion Data from ARTIS supports that the b/tsDMARDs currently used to treat RA have acceptable and largely similar safety profiles, but differences exist in particular concerning tolerability and specific infection risks.",
