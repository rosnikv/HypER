Participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 6-month treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. One hundred sixty-five patients completed the study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMonocyte and lymphocyte release of proinflammatory cytokines and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control subjects, monocytes and lymphocytes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients released greater amounts of all cytokines studied. Levothyroxine reduced monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, whereas selenomethionine inhibited lymphocyte release of IL-2, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma CRP levels. The decrease in cytokine release and in plasma CRP levels was strongest when both drugs were given together.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite affecting different types of inflammatory cells, levothyroxine and selenomethionine exhibit a similar systemic antiinflammatory effect in euthyroid females with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This action, which correlates with a reduction in thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, may be associated with clinical benefits in the prevention and management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly in subjects receiving both agents.",

            "abstract": "CONTEXT\nNo previous study determined monocyte- and lymphocyte-suppressing effects of levothyroxine and selenomethionine and assessed whether their coadministration is superior to treatment with only one of these drugs.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to compare the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION\nWe conducted a randomized clinical trial involving a group of 170 ambulatory euthyroid women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 41 matched healthy subjects. Participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 6-month treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. One hundred sixty-five patients completed the study.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMonocyte and lymphocyte release of proinflammatory cytokines and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the control subjects, monocytes and lymphocytes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients released greater amounts of all cytokines studied. Levothyroxine reduced monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, whereas selenomethionine inhibited lymphocyte release of IL-2, interferon-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma CRP levels. The decrease in cytokine release and in plasma CRP levels was strongest when both drugs were given together.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite affecting different types of inflammatory cells, levothyroxine and selenomethionine exhibit a similar systemic antiinflammatory effect in euthyroid females with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This action, which correlates with a reduction in thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, may be associated with clinical benefits in the prevention and management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly in subjects receiving both agents.",

            "abstract": "Summary The aim of this prospective study was to investigate for the first time whether levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, affect coagulation and fibrinolysis in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients with normal thyroid function tests. A group of 155 ambulatory women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, of whom 149 completed the study, were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to six months of treatment with levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine plus selenomethionine, or placebo. The control group included 39 matched healthy women. The prothrombin time ratio, the activated partial thromboplastin time, and plasma levels/activities of fibrinogen, factor VII, von Willebrand factor, factor X and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were assessed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment. Compared with the healthy subjects, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis patients exhibited higher plasma levels/activities of all of the parameters studied, as well as were characterised by the abnormal prothrombin time ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time. All these haemostatic disturbances were reduced or normalised by levothyroxine + selenomethionine treatment, while the effect of levothyroxine or selenomethionine was limited to fibrinogen and PAI-1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that euthyroid women with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis are characterised by abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. Levothyroxine and selenomethionine, especially if administered together, produce a beneficial effect on haemostasis in euthyroid patients with this disorder. Note: This study was in part a sub-study of another trial (ACTRN 12611000238976), which assessed the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release in Hashimoto\u201cs thyroiditis patients.

We herein report a case of AVWS associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subcutaneous mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. An IgG autoantibody against von Willebrand factor (VWF) was detected. The antibody bound to VWF but did not inhibit VWF activity. Rapid clearance of VWF seemed to be the cause of AVWS in the present case. VWF-containing concentrates stopped the bleeding. Even if such a complication is rare, for AVWS patients, prompt recognition of the underlying mechanism can save lives.",
