Buflomedil, a vasoactive substance with hemorheological properties, has been widely used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of buflomedil on clinical and hemorheological parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes and intermittent claudication.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty patients were randomly assigned to oral buflomedil or matching placebo for six months in a double-blind manner. Initial and absolute walking distances were assessed by a standard treadmill testing protocol. Erythrocyte deformability was estimated with a whole blood filtration technique. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was assessed with an aggregation profiler. beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 were measured with radioimmunoassays. All tests were performed at baseline and after three and six months of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant increase in the mean initial (71%) and absolute (68%) walking distance was achieved only in the buflomedil group. ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in the buflomedil group, while no significant changes in erythrocyte deformability, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor-4 levels were noticed. However, beta-thromboglobulin levels increased significantly in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest the therapeutic efficacy of buflomedil in diabetic subjects with intermittent claudication. The inhibition of platelet aggregation and the influence on platelet activity exerted by the drug could play an important role in its clinical effect and may be of value in the treatment of such patients.",

            "abstract": "Signorelli et al in this issue of Angiology screened almost 3500 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 61.3 + 9.7 years) using the ankle brachial index (ABI) to detect unrecognized peripheral arterial disease (PAD). An ABI 0.9 was considered diagnostic. A total of 80 (2.3%) participants had unrecognized PAD. Of interest, among those individuals with unrecognized PAD, 5% (n 1\u20444 4) also had >75% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, whereas 12.5% (n 1\u20444 8) had an ejection fraction 30% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In multivariate analysis, an ABI 50% stenosis, whereas 2.7% had an occluded internal carotid artery. An ABI 3-fold increased risk for >50% carotid stenosis compared with individuals with an ABI >0.9 (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% CI, 1.04-10.93; P 1\u20444 .033). An ABI <0.9 in patients with asymptomatic PAD is not only a marker of generalized atherosclerosis but also a predictor of perioperative myocardial damage, should these patients undergo vascular surgery for an unrelated condition. The ABI was recorded in 627 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. In multivariate analysis, an asymptomatic ABI <0.9 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of perioperative myocardial damage (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2). Besides the ABI, several other markers/tests may reflect the presence of PAD. Examples include C-reactive protein (CRP) and functional photoplethysmograph technology using a noninvasive automated device. Both have the advantage that, unlike the ABI, they are less operator-dependent. Future studies should evaluate the prognostic significance of these variables in patients with PAD as well as their ability to identify unrecognized PAD. The identification of subclinical PAD holds implications for the timely initiation of preventive measures, namely smoking cessation, weight reduction, adoption of exercise, blood pressure and diabetes mellitus control, management of dyslipidemia, and antiplatelet treatment. Patients with PAD need to be closely monitored. The early diagnosis of PAD and the initiation of conservative measures is associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but also with several additional beneficial actions. For example, PAD is associated with the metabolic syndrome which requires treatment in its own right. Besides the management of dyslipidemia, routine statin treatment in patients with PAD is associated with an improvement in claudication, increased walking distance, and",

            "abstract": "Signorelli et al in this issue of Angiology screened almost 3500 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 61.3 + 9.7 years) using the ankle brachial index (ABI) to detect unrecognized peripheral arterial disease (PAD). An ABI 0.9 was considered diagnostic. A total of 80 (2.3%) participants had unrecognized PAD. Of interest, among those individuals with unrecognized PAD, 5% (n 1\u20444 4) also had >75% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, whereas 12.5% (n 1\u20444 8) had an ejection fraction 30% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In multivariate analysis, an ABI 50% stenosis, whereas 2.7% had an occluded internal carotid artery. An ABI 3-fold increased risk for >50% carotid stenosis compared with individuals with an ABI >0.9 (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% CI, 1.04-10.93; P 1\u20444 .033). An ABI <0.9 in patients with asymptomatic PAD is not only a marker of generalized atherosclerosis but also a predictor of perioperative myocardial damage, should these patients undergo vascular surgery for an unrelated condition. The ABI was recorded in 627 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. In multivariate analysis, an asymptomatic ABI <0.9 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of perioperative myocardial damage (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2). Besides the ABI, several other markers/tests may reflect the presence of PAD. Examples include C-reactive protein (CRP) and functional photoplethysmograph technology using a noninvasive automated device. Both have the advantage that, unlike the ABI, they are less operator-dependent. Future studies should evaluate the prognostic significance of these variables in patients with PAD as well as their ability to identify unrecognized PAD. The identification of subclinical PAD holds implications for the timely initiation of preventive measures, namely smoking cessation, weight reduction, adoption of exercise, blood pressure and diabetes mellitus control, management of dyslipidemia, and antiplatelet treatment. Patients with PAD need to be closely monitored. The early diagnosis of PAD and the initiation of conservative measures is associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but also with several additional beneficial actions. For example, PAD is associated with the metabolic syndrome which requires treatment in its own right. Besides the management of dyslipidemia, routine statin treatment in patients with PAD is associated with an improvement in claudication, increased walking distance, and",

            "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of atherosclerotic vascular disease and the incidence of infrapopliteal PAD continues to rise in the population. The historical experience with surgical and endovascular interventions for infrapopliteal stenosis was disappointing as operators experienced high rates of early technical failures and procedural complications, coupled with high rates of restenosis in this vascular territory when compared with more proximal vascular beds. While patients with infrapopliteal PAD may be asymptomatic, the majority would ultimately develop intermittent claudication or may also present with critical limb ischemia. In this article, we review the current literature, and discuss some of the technical aspects of endovascular therapy in this vascular bed. We also emphasize the importance of adjunctive evidence-based therapies such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and lifestyle modification such as smoking cessation in this particularly high-risk cohort to optimize clinical outcomes.",

            "abstract": "The use of endovascular techniques for the treatment of occlusive arterial disease below the knee has gained widespread acceptance and is considered by many as the first line treatment for patients with critical limb ischaemia. Tibial angioplasty and stenting have a high rate of technical success and are relatively low risk procedures, which has widened their applicability to include treatment for the elderly and those with comorbidities unsuitable for open bypass surgery. Despite these advantages the durability of the percutaneous revascularisation remains inferior to that of open surgery for diffusely diseased arteries. In the search to improve their long term performance we have sought to investigate the role of coronary drug eluting stents (DES) in the tibial vasculature in the hope that they may reduce recurrent stenosis, the leading threat to interventional patency. Ample data now exists in the form of registries and randomised trials designed to evaluate the use of DES in the crural arteries below the knee. This article reviews this body of research, explores the use of these devices in more complex lesions, speculates on their future development and examines their cost-effectiveness.",

Methods: Tibial and distal popliteal angioplasty was performed in 15 limbs of 14 patients (9 men; median age 82 years) with critical limb ischemia (CLI, n=7) or severe claudication. The 18 lesions (mean length 22.2\u00b114.0 mm) were implanted with 22 everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffolds (Absorb). Clinical and ultrasound follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to detect restenosis and evaluate safety, midterm restenosis rate, and clinical improvement. Results: Immediate technical success was 100%, although a single limb suffered 2 scaffold thromboses on the first day; it was salvaged with repeat endovascular intervention. All patients were available for surveillance examinations during a follow-up of 6.1\u00b13.9 months; no patient died. Of the 15 limbs in the analysis, clinical improvement was present in 12 (4 of 7 CLI patients); there was no amputation, bypass surgery, or evidence of binary restenosis on follow-up sonographic examination.

Methods: A single-center study prospectively enrolled 48 symptomatic patients (mean age 82.1\u00b18.0 years; 27 men) between September 2013 and February 2018 to evaluate the Absorb everolimus-eluting BVS system in distal popliteal and tibial lesions. Mean lesion length was 20.1\u00b110.8 mm. Following predilation, up to 2 BVS were implanted in target lesions in 55 limbs. Clinical and duplex ultrasound follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months to determine 30-day morbidity and midterm Kaplan-Meier estimates of binary restenosis, clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), amputation, and mortality. Results: Seventy-one scaffolds were implanted to treat 61 lesions. Technical success was achieved in all patients, with no amputation, death, or target limb bypass surgery within 30 days of the index procedure. There was 1 early thrombotic occlusion of 2 BVS in a previously anticoagulated patient not given antiplatelet medication after the procedure. During a mean follow-up of 24.0\u00b115.3 months, 11 (23%) patients died; the remaining 37 were available for follow-up. Binary restenosis (50%\u201375%) was detected in 6 (8%) scaffolds. Primary patency estimates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 92.2%, 90.3%, and 81.1%; freedom from CD-TLR estimates were 97.2%, 97.2%, and 87.3% at the same time points. No late scaffold thrombosis has been observed. The majority of the 55 limbs (51, 93%) were clinically improved; 4 (7%) were unchanged. Thirty-six (92%) of 39 limbs treated for tissue loss achieved complete wound healing, with no major amputation (limb salvage 100%). Conclusion: Midterm follow-up demonstrates excellent safety, patency, and freedom from CD-TLR rates using the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold below the knee.",

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 41 patients (median age 64 years; 23 men) with CLTI owing to >50% de novo infrapopliteal lesions (n=53) treated with the Absorb BVS between August 2012 and June 2017. The majority of patients (37, 90%) had diabetes, 24 (59%) had ischemic heart disease, and 39 (95%) had Rutherford category 5/6 ischemia with tissue loss. The mean lesion length was 22.7\u00b117.2 mm; 10 (24%) lesions were severely calcified. Assessments included technical success, primary patency, freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), amputation-free survival, limb salvage, complete wound healing, resolution of rest pain, and resolution of CLTI without TLR at 6 and 12 months after the index intervention. Results: Overall, 69 scaffolds were implanted in the 53 lesions, with 100% technical success. There were no deaths within 30 days of the index procedure. The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were 95% and 86%, respectively. The corresponding rates of freedom from CD-TLR were 98% and 93%, respectively. Freedom from major amputation was 98% at both time points, and amputation-free survival was 93% and 85% at 6 and 12 months after the index procedure.

            "abstract": "Purpose: To report an experience with the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) in an Asian cohort with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) from the DISAPEAR (Drug Impregnated Bioresorbable Stent in Asian Population Extremity Arterial Revascularization) registry. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 41 patients (median age 64 years; 23 men) with CLTI owing to >50% de novo infrapopliteal lesions (n=53) treated with the Absorb BVS between August 2012 and June 2017. The majority of patients (37, 90%) had diabetes, 24 (59%) had ischemic heart disease, and 39 (95%) had Rutherford category 5/6 ischemia with tissue loss. The mean lesion length was 22.7\u00b117.2 mm; 10 (24%) lesions were severely calcified. Assessments included technical success, primary patency, freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), amputation-free survival, limb salvage, complete wound healing, resolution of rest pain, and resolution of CLTI without TLR at 6 and 12 months after the index intervention. Results: Overall, 69 scaffolds were implanted in the 53 lesions, with 100% technical success. There were no deaths within 30 days of the index procedure. The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were 95% and 86%, respectively. The corresponding rates of freedom from CD-TLR were 98% and 93%, respectively. Freedom from major amputation was 98% at both time points, and amputation-free survival was 93% and 85% at 6 and 12 months after the index procedure. Wound healing occurred in 31 patients (79%) with Rutherford category 5/6 ischemia by the end of 12 months. Conclusion: The Absorb BVS demonstrated good 1-year patency and clinical outcomes in CLTI patients with complex infrapopliteal disease.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAmong patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and infrapopliteal artery disease, angioplasty has been associated with frequent reintervention and adverse limb outcomes from restenosis. The effect of the use of drug-eluting resorbable scaffolds on these outcomes remains unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, 261 patients with CLTI and infrapopliteal artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with an everolimus-eluting resorbable scaffold or angioplasty. The primary efficacy end point was freedom from the following events at 1 year: amputation above the ankle of the target limb, occlusion of the target vessel, clinically driven revascularization of the target lesion, and binary restenosis of the target lesion. The primary safety end point was freedom from major adverse limb events at 6 months and from perioperative death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary efficacy end point was observed (i.e., no events occurred) in 135 of 173 patients in the scaffold group and 48 of 88 patients in the angioplasty group (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 74% vs. 44%; absolute difference, 30 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 46; one-sided P<0.001 for superiority). The primary safety end point was observed in 165 of 170 patients in the scaffold group and 90 of 90 patients in the angioplasty group (absolute difference, -3 percentage points; 95% CI, -6 to 0; one-sided P<0.001 for noninferiority). Serious adverse events related to the index procedure occurred in 2% of the patients in the scaffold group and 3% of those in the angioplasty group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with CLTI due to infrapopliteal artery disease, the use of an everolimus-eluting resorbable scaffold was superior to angioplasty with respect to the primary efficacy end point.
