            "abstract": "Recently, high interest has been attracted           to the research of inflammatory bowel diseases           (IBD). Recombinant probiotic bacteria may represent           an interesting way to influence the course of           IBD. Their benefits include cheap and simple production           and easy manipulation of the genetic material.           Several gene therapy and probiotic approaches           already showed promising results in the past. The           aim of this study was to test the probiotic potential of           IL-10-expressing Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in a mouse           model of IBD and to compare it with control bacterial           strains. The dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)           model of colitis was examined for this purpose. Animals           received control probiotic bacteria or modified           probiotics (expressing IL-10) via gastric gavage.           Body weight, stool consistency, food and water consumption           were monitored. At the end of the experiment,           the parameters of inflammation, oxidative           stress and carbonyl stress were analysed in the samples           and statistical analysis was performed. We prepared           an anti-inflammatory probiotic Escherichia           coli strain that we designated Nissle 1917/pMEC-IL10           and proved its anti-inflammatory properties, which           are similar to those of the control probiotic strains           Nissle 1917 and Lactococcus lactis/pMEC-IL10 in vivo.           The probiotic therapy was successful according to           several parameters, including colon length, and oxidative           and carbonyl stress. Bacterially produced           IL-10 was detected in the plasma. The potential of           bacterial anti-inflammatory therapy of IBD using           modified probiotics           was outlined. The results opened           a way for upcoming studies using modified probiotics           for therapy of systemic diseases.",

            "abstract": "AIM\nTo determine the efficacy profiles of different concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) for treating colitis using an experimental murine model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nColitis was established in 64 BALB/c mice by adding 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to the drinking water and allowing ad libitum access for 7 d. The mice were then randomly divided into the following control and experimental model groups (n = 8 each; day 0): untreated model control; negative-treatment model control (administered gavage of 1 mL/10 g normal saline); experimental-treatment models C4-C8 (administered gavage of 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7), or 10(8) CFU/10 g L. acidophilus, respectively); positive-treatment model control (administration of the anti-inflammatory agent prednisone acetate at 45 \u03bcg/10 g). Eight mice given regular water (no DSS) and no subsequent treatments served as the normal control group. Body weight, fecal traits, and presence of fecal occult blood were assessed daily. All animals were sacrificed on post-treatment day 7 to measure colonic length, perform histological scoring, and quantify the major bacteria in the proximal and distal colon. Intergroup differences were determined by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls comparison.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll treatments (L. acidophilus and prednisone acetate) protected against colitis-induced weight loss (P < 0.05 vs model and normal control groups). The extent of colitis-induced colonic shortening was significantly reduced by all treatments (prednisone acetate > C4 > C5 > C7 > C8 > C6; P < 0.05 vs untreated model group), and the C6 group showed colonic length similar to that of the normal control group (P > 0.05). The C6 group also had the lowest disease activity index scores among the model groups. The bacterial profiles in the proximal colon were similar between all of the experimental-treatment model groups (all P > 0.05). In contrast, the bacterial profile in the distal colon of the C6 group showed the distinctive features (P < 0.05 vs all other experimental-treatment model groups) of Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. being the most abundant bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus being the least abundant bacteria.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe most therapeutically efficacious concentration of L. acidophilus (10(6) CFU/10 g) may exert its effects by modulating the bacterial profile in the distal colon.",

Probiotics exert protective effects against IBD, and probiotic commensal Lactobacillus species are common inhabitants of the natural microbiota, especially in the gut. To investigate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the development of IBD, L. acidophilus was administered orally in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. DSS-induced damage and the therapeutic effect of L. acidophilus were investigated. Treatment with L. acidophilus attenuated the severity of DSS-induced colitis. Specifically, it suppressed proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17 in the colon tissues, which are produced by T helper (Th) 17 cells. Moreover, in vitro L. acidophilus treatment directly induced T regulatory (Treg) cells and the production of IL-10, whereas the production of IL-17 was suppressed in splenocytes. In addition, we found that L. acidophilus treatment decreased the levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a marker of activated myofibroblasts, and type I collagen compared with control mice. These results suggest that L. acidophilus may be a novel treatment for IBD by modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, as well as fibrosis development.",

SHIP deficient mice develop fully penetrant, spontaneous ileitis at 6 weeks of age, and thus offer a tractable model of Crohn\u2019s disease-like inflammation. Since disruptions to the microbiome are implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn\u2019s disease, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene survey of the ileum, cecum, colon, and stool contents of SHIP+/+ and SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice. We predicted that diversity and compositional changes would occur after, and possibly prior to, the onset of overt disease. No differences were found in alpha diversity, but significant changes in beta diversity and specific commensal populations were observed in the ileal compartment of SHIP deficient mice after the onset of overt disease. Specifically, reductions in the Bacteroidales taxa, Muribaculum intestinale, and an expansion in Lactobacillus were most notable. In contrast, expansions to bacterial taxa previously associated with inflammation, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella were observed in the ilea of SHIP deficient mice prior to the onset of overt disease. Finally, antibiotic treatment reduced the development of intestinal inflammation in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, our findings indicate that SHIP is involved in maintaining ileal microbial homeostasis. These results have broader implications for humans, since reduced SHIP protein levels have been reported in people with Crohn\u2019s disease.",

Intestinal bacteria are thought to regulate tumorigenesis. The longer the breastfeeding period, the lower is the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we investigated preventive effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus M9 (Probio-M9) on colitis-associated tumorigenesis. An inflammatory colorectal tumor model was established using a 6-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mouse, which was intraperitoneally administered with azoxymethane (AOM: 12 mg/kg body weight). On weeks 2 and 4, 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was administered to mice for 7 days through drinking water. On weeks 8 and 10, Probio-M9 (2 \u00d7 109/day) was orally administered for 7 days. Animals were sacrificed at 20 weeks after AOM administration and immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting was performed. The \u03b1-diversity of microflora (Shannon index), principal coordinate analysis, and distribution of intestinal bacterium genera and metabolic pathways were compared. The AOM/DSS group showed weight loss, diarrhea, intestinal shortening, increased number of colon tumors, proliferating tumorigenesis, increased inflammation score, fibrosis, increased CD68+, or CD163+ macrophage cells in the subserosal layer of non-tumor areas. Inflammation and tumorigenesis ameliorated after Probio-M9 treatment. Fecal microbial functions were altered by AOM/DSS treatment. Probio-M9 significantly upregulated the fecal microbial diversity and reversed fecal microbial functions. Thus, Probio-M9 could suppress tumor formation in the large intestine by regulating the intestinal environment and ameliorating inflammation, suggesting its therapeutic potential for treatment of inflammation and colitis-associated tumorigenesis.",

            "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, and inflammatory cytokines secreted from inflammatory cells and active oxygen facilitate tumorigenesis. Intestinal bacteria are thought to regulate tumorigenesis. The longer the breastfeeding period, the lower is the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we investigated preventive effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus M9 (Probio-M9) on colitis-associated tumorigenesis. An inflammatory colorectal tumor model was established using a 6-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mouse, which was intraperitoneally administered with azoxymethane (AOM: 12 mg/kg body weight). On weeks 2 and 4, 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was administered to mice for 7 days through drinking water. On weeks 8 and 10, Probio-M9 (2 \u00d7 109/day) was orally administered for 7 days. Animals were sacrificed at 20 weeks after AOM administration and immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting was performed. The \u03b1-diversity of microflora (Shannon index), principal coordinate analysis, and distribution of intestinal bacterium genera and metabolic pathways were compared. The AOM/DSS group showed weight loss, diarrhea, intestinal shortening, increased number of colon tumors, proliferating tumorigenesis, increased inflammation score, fibrosis, increased CD68+, or CD163+ macrophage cells in the subserosal layer of non-tumor areas. Inflammation and tumorigenesis ameliorated after Probio-M9 treatment. Fecal microbial functions were altered by AOM/DSS treatment. Probio-M9 significantly upregulated the fecal microbial diversity and reversed fecal microbial functions. Thus, Probio-M9 could suppress tumor formation in the large intestine by regulating the intestinal environment and ameliorating inflammation, suggesting its therapeutic potential for treatment of inflammation and colitis-associated tumorigenesis.",

Previous studies have shown beneficial effects in AAD treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis XLTG11, Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probio-M9. However, no studies have been conducted on the immunomodulatory effects and protective intestinal barrier function of four complex probiotics. The aim of our study is to investigate the alleviation effects of complex probiotics on ampicillin-induced AAD. Methods Thirty-six BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group (NC), model control group (MC), low-, medium-, and high-dose probiotics groups (LD, MD, and HD), and positive drug (Bifico, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 cfu) control group (PDC; Bifico, also known as Bifidobacterium Triple Live Capsule, is composed of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Enterococcus faecalis). An AAD model was established by intragastric administration of ampicillin, by gavage of different doses of complex probiotics and Bifico. The weight gain, fecal water content, loose stool grade, intestinal permeability, total protein and albumin levels, intestinal barrier, cytokine levels, and gut microbiota were determined. Results The results showed that complex probiotics significantly decreased the fecal water content, loose stool grade, intestinal permeability, and ileum tissue damage. Their application increased the weight gain, SIgA, TP, and ALB levels. Additionally, complex probiotics significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased those of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and MUC2 were significantly upregulated in the probiotic-treated group. Furthermore, the complex probiotics increased the gut microbiota diversity and modulated the changes in the gut microbiota composition caused by ampicillin. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria in the HD group was lower than that in the MC group, whereas that of Bacteroidetes was higher. At the genus level, the abundances of Klebsiella and Parabacteroides in the HD group were lower, whereas those of Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae, and Lactobacillus were higher than those in the MC group. Moreover, Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis also found that several specific gut microbiota were significantly correlated with AAD-related indicators. Conclusion We found that complex probiotics improved the diarrhea-related indexes, regulated gut microbiota composition and diversity, increased the expression levels of intestinal protective barrier-related genes, preserved the intestinal barrier function, and relieved inflammation and intestinal injury, thereby effectively improving AAD-associated symptoms.
