            "abstract": "Reducing the dietary glycemic load and the glycemic index was proposed as a novel approach to weight reduction. A parallel-design, randomized 12-wk controlled feeding trial with a 24-wk follow-up phase was conducted to test the hypothesis that a hypocaloric diet designed to reduce the glycemic load and the glycemic index would result in greater sustained weight loss than other hypocaloric diets. Obese subjects (n = 29) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 diets providing 3138 kJ less than estimated energy needs: high glycemic index (HGI), low glycemic index (LGI), or high fat (HF). For the first 12 wk, all food was provided to subjects (feeding phase). Subjects (n = 22) were instructed to follow the assigned diet for 24 additional weeks (free-living phase). Total body weight was obtained and body composition was assessed by skinfold measurements. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA). At 12 wk, weight changes from baseline were significant in all groups but not different among groups (-9.3 +/- 1.3 kg for the HGI diet, -9.9 +/- 1.4 kg for the LGI diet, and -8.4 +/- 1.5 kg for the HF diet). All groups improved in insulin sensitivity at the end of the feeding phase of the study. During the free-living phase, all groups maintained their initial weight loss and their improved insulin sensitivity. Weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity scores were independent of diet composition. In summary, lowering the glycemic load and glycemic index of weight reduction diets does not provide any added benefit to energy restriction in promoting weight loss in obese subjects.",

            "abstract": "This work investigated the effects of different lifestyle strategies for reversing some of the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities commonly known as an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP) in groups at increased risk for CVD, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM), the overweight and obese. These strategies included a low glycaemic index (GI) diet, energy restriction, a low carbohydrate Atkins diet, and increased exercise level. The diets were tested either alone or in combination to examine the potential for additive effects on outcome measures. The effects of a low GI diet, alone and in combination with energy restriction, were investigated in overweight/obese T2 DM patients in Kuwait (Chapter 4). For this purpose, the glycaemic and insulinaemic indices of some staple foods in the Kuwaiti diets were determined to provide data from which low GI foods could be selected (Chapter 3). A standard WHO procedure was used for determining the glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (II) of seven types of bread and a type of white rice that are consumed extensively by the Kuwaiti population. Six of the breads in the Kuwaiti diet were shown to have GI values that fell within an intermediate GI range, which was comparable to the GI values of similar foods reported in the literature. The exception to this was a brown pita bread which gave a high GI value and a relatively higher II value compared with glucose. Iranian bread also had a high II value compared to that of the glucose standard. In Chapter 4, the effects of two low GI diets, with and without energy restriction, were examined on markers of CVD risk in overweight/obese T2 DM patients and compared with a control diet, in a6 week, randomised controlled trial. The average GI of the diet was reduced by 12 units in the intervention groups. An additive effect of weight loss in the energy-restricted low GI diet group was not shown because of the limited amount of weight loss in this group (3% reduction from baseline weight); a direct result of poor compliance. Both intervention groups produced similar effects that included a decrease in the concentration of plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Glycaemic control, as measured by fructosamine levels, improved significantly in the low GI group compared to the control. Lowering the GI of the diet also resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of small, dense LDL (sdLDL) and an increase in HDL2. Chapter 5 compared the effects of a low-carbohydrate, `Atkins' diet either alone, or in combination with an exercise programme, to provide evidence for the potential of exercise to modify the effects of this type of diet over 6-months in a randomised trial. Participants all together in this study had a 6.4% reduction in body weight. The lowcarbohydrate diet had some significant beneficial effects on the components of an ALP, in particular, decreasing plasma TAG, increasing both HDL-C and HDL size, and decreasing the proportion of sdLDL. Hyperinsulinaemia was unaffected by the consumption of a low carbohydrate diet. The favourable changes in lipids with the low carbohydrate diet were associated with weight loss as a result of decreased energy intake. This study was however unable to differentiate between the effect of exercise and the low carbohydrate diet on an ALP, probably because of poor compliance to the exercise program. Taken together, both of the intervention studies resulted in reductions in metabolic risk factors for CVD, including a decrease in plasma TAG and increase in HDL-C across the two studies. Poor compliance to the energy-restricted diet in the low GI study in Kuwait, and to exercise regimens in the Atkins study did not allow any further interpretation of these experimental approaches. The promotion of the dietary approaches used in this thesis should be considered for the management of obesity and/or T2 DM and their associated CVD risk factors.",
