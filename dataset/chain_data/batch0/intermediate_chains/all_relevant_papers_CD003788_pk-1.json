        "title": "Acupuncture beyond the endorphin concept?",
        "abstract": "Traditional acupuncture has been used for treating a variety of health conditions. In contrast, Western physicians limited acupuncture to the alleviation of pain. Concomitant with a recent view that not all kinds of pain are within the reach of acupuncture-induced relief, it has been suggested that some conditions other than pain can be effectively treated by this method. Increased release of the neuropeptide beta-endorphin was proposed to explain the antinociceptive function of acupuncture. Even if correct beta-endorphin cannot account for the effect of acupuncture in other conditions. Endorphins might be interacting with cytokines, some of which (e.g. interleukin-10) downregulate the inflammatory component of disorders in which acupuncture may be useful. We present a speculative notion of the view that acupuncture may amplify the interaction between neuropeptides and cytokines. A non-invasive approach, such as immune-committed cells harvested from blood of acupuncture-treated patients, could be used to examine this hypothesis. Inclusion of a placebo group might support the credibility of acupuncture.",
