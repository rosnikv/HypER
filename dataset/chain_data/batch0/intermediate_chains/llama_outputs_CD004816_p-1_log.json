Observational studies and secondary analyses from lipid-lowering trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the effect of these agents on bone mineral density and fracture risk.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to determine whether clinically significant skeletal benefits result from hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition in postmenopausal women.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nWe conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging comparative clinical trial at 62 sites in the United States.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nParticipants included 626 postmenopausal women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/liter) and less than 190 mg/dl (4.9 mmol/liter), and lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density T-score between 0.0 and -2.5.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nOnce-daily placebo or 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin was administered.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe assessed percent change from baseline in lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density with each dose of atorvastatin compared with placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 52 wk, there was no significant difference between each atorvastatin and placebo group or change from baseline at any tested dose of atorvastatin or placebo in lumbar (L1-L4) spine bone mineral density. Nor did atorvastatin produce a significant change in bone mineral density at any other site. Changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover did not differ significantly between each atorvastatin and placebo group. All doses of atorvastatin were generally well tolerated, with similar incidences of adverse events across all dose groups and placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinically relevant doses of atorvastatin that lower lipid levels had no effect on bone mineral density or biochemical indices of bone metabolism in this study, suggesting that such oral agents are not useful in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.",

Conclusions 5-year exposure to statins is associated with a reduced risk of low-energy hip fracture in women aged 50\u201380 years without prior hospitalizations for fractures.",

Aim In this study, we investigated the association between different statins and the development of NOFs. Patients and methods This was a longitudinal cohort study performed using data from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance, including case patients with NOFs from January 2004 to December 2013 and non-NOF subjects. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of NOFs associated with statin use. Nonuser subjects served as the reference group. Results A total of 44,405 patients with NOFs were identified from among 170,533 patients with hyperlipidemia during the study period. The risk of developing NOFs after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and concurrent medication use was lower among users of atorvastatin (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71\u20130.84) and rosuvastatin (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.81) than among simvastatin users.

            "abstract": "Objective Whether HMG-CoA-reductase inhibition, the main mechanism of statins, plays a role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, is not entirely known so far. Consequently, this study was set out to investigate the relationship of different kinds and dosages of statins with osteoporosis, hypothesising that the inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol could influence sex-hormones and therefore the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Methods Medical claims data of all Austrians from 2006 to 2007 was used to identify all patients treated with statins to compute their daily defined dose averages of six different types of statins. We applied multiple logistic regression to analyse the dose-dependent risks of being diagnosed with osteoporosis for each statin individually. Results In the general study population, statin treatment was associated with an overrepresentation of diagnosed osteoporosis compared with controls (OR: 3.62, 95%\u2009CI 3.55 to 3.69, p<0.01). There was a highly non-trivial dependence of statin dosage with the ORs of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was underrepresented in low-dose statin treatment (0\u201310\u2009mg per day), including lovastatin (OR: 0.39, CI 0.18 to 0.84, p<0.05), pravastatin (OR: 0.68, 95%\u2009CI 0.52 to 0.89, p<0.01), simvastatin (OR: 0.70, 95%\u2009CI 0.56 to 0.86, p<0.01) and rosuvastatin (OR: 0.69, 95%\u2009CI 0.55 to 0.87, p<0.01). However, the exceeding of the 40\u2009mg threshold for simvastatin (OR: 1.64, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 2.07, p<0.01), and the exceeding of a 20\u2009mg threshold for atorvastatin (OR: 1.78, 95%\u2009CI 1.41 to 2.23, p<0.01) and for rosuvastatin (OR: 2.04, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 3.18, p<0.01) was related to an overrepresentation of osteoporosis. Conclusion Our results show that the diagnosis of osteoporosis in statin-treated patients is dose-dependent. Thus, osteoporosis is underrepresented in low-dose and overrepresented in high-dose statin treatment, demonstrating the importance of future studies\u2019 taking dose-dependency into account when investigating the relationship between statins and osteoporosis.",

            "abstract": "Objective Whether HMG-CoA-reductase inhibition, the main mechanism of statins, plays a role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, is not entirely known so far. Consequently, this study was set out to investigate the relationship of different kinds and dosages of statins with osteoporosis, hypothesising that the inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol could influence sex-hormones and therefore the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Methods Medical claims data of all Austrians from 2006 to 2007 was used to identify all patients treated with statins to compute their daily defined dose averages of six different types of statins. We applied multiple logistic regression to analyse the dose-dependent risks of being diagnosed with osteoporosis for each statin individually. Results In the general study population, statin treatment was associated with an overrepresentation of diagnosed osteoporosis compared with controls (OR: 3.62, 95%\u2009CI 3.55 to 3.69, p<0.01). There was a highly non-trivial dependence of statin dosage with the ORs of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was underrepresented in low-dose statin treatment (0\u201310\u2009mg per day), including lovastatin (OR: 0.39, CI 0.18 to 0.84, p<0.05), pravastatin (OR: 0.68, 95%\u2009CI 0.52 to 0.89, p<0.01), simvastatin (OR: 0.70, 95%\u2009CI 0.56 to 0.86, p<0.01) and rosuvastatin (OR: 0.69, 95%\u2009CI 0.55 to 0.87, p<0.01). However, the exceeding of the 40\u2009mg threshold for simvastatin (OR: 1.64, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 2.07, p<0.01), and the exceeding of a 20\u2009mg threshold for atorvastatin (OR: 1.78, 95%\u2009CI 1.41 to 2.23, p<0.01) and for rosuvastatin (OR: 2.04, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 3.18, p<0.01) was related to an overrepresentation of osteoporosis. Conclusion Our results show that the diagnosis of osteoporosis in statin-treated patients is dose-dependent. Thus, osteoporosis is underrepresented in low-dose and overrepresented in high-dose statin treatment, demonstrating the importance of future studies\u2019 taking dose-dependency into account when investigating the relationship between statins and osteoporosis.",

Moreover, a new approach to post-stroke neuroplasticity including the use of agents from marine sources such as fucoxanthin and tramiprosate as compounds that might be used as potential neuroprotectants with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties is introduced.",

            "abstract": "After a stroke, patients can suffer from sarcopenia, which can affect recovery. This could be closely related to an impairment in nutritional status. In this preliminary analysis of a longitudinal prospective study, we screened 110 subjects admitted to our rehabilitation center after a stroke. We then enrolled 61 patients, who underwent a 6-week course of rehabilitation treatment. We identified a group of 18 sarcopenic patients (SG), according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2), by evaluating muscle strength with the handgrip test, and muscle mass with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). With respect to the non-sarcopenic group (NSG), the SG at admission (T0) had worse muscle quality, according to the BIA-derived phase angle, and a lower score of MNA\u00ae-SF. In contrast to the NSG, the SG also exhibited lower values for both BMI and the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) at T0 and T1. Moreover, 33% of the SG had a major risk of nutrition-related complications (GNRI at T0 < 92) and discarded on average more food during the six weeks of rehabilitation (about one-third of the average daily plate waste). Of note is the fact that the Barthel Index\u2019s change from baseline indicated that the SG had a worse functional recovery than the NGS. These results suggest that an accurate diagnosis of sarcopenia, along with a proper evaluation of the nutritional status on admission to rehabilitation centers, appears strictly necessary to design individual, targeted physical and nutritional intervention for post-stroke patients, to improve their ability outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Considering that malnutrition (undernutrition) is common in stroke patients and may negatively impact body function, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between nutritional risk and functional status in stroke patients at admission to a rehabilitation unit. Nutritional risk was assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score. Functional status was assessed using the Barthel Index, the modified Rankin Scale, the Trunk Control Test and the Sitting Balance Scale, and cognitive function was assessed using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and D-dimer were also evaluated as established prognostic biomarkers. Stroke patients (n = 245; age 69.7 \u00b1 12.8 years; 47%, women; 82% ischemic stroke) at admission to a rehabilitation unit were included in this study. A high prevalence of nutritional risk was detected with each tool and was found to be greater using the GNRI and in patients aged \u226575 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age and dysphagia were independent predictors of high nutritional risk. High risk groups performed worse on all functional tests compared to the low-risk groups (p < 0.05). Nutritional risk with each tool was associated with functional and cognitive statuses (with the highest correlation being with the Trunk Control Test). Significant associations were also found with C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and D-dimer. In conclusion, a high nutritional risk, as evaluated with the GNRI, the PNI and the CONUT score, was detected in stroke patients at admission to a rehabilitation unit. High nutritional risk was associated with functional status and with predictors of clinical outcomes (and specifically in older patients).",

                    "explanation": "This paper examines the predictive value of nutritional risk for all-cause death and functional outcomes in elderly patients with acute stroke. It uses the GNRI and NRS-2002 as nutritional risk assessment tools, which are related to the source paper's focus on nutritional risk and functional status in stroke patients. The paper's findings could be seen as building upon or using the source paper's results, as it explores similar outcomes (nutritional risk, functional outcomes) in a similar population (stroke patients).",
