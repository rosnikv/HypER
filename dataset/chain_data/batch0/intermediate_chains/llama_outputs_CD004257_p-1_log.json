            "abstract": "Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, and placebo were compared to determine their efficacy and safety in osteoarthritis of the knee. In two identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose, parallel-design studies, patients with osteoarthritis aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 60.6 \u00b1 12.8 years were randomized to daily doses of 660 mg naproxen sodium (440 mg naproxen sodium in patients \u226565 years), 4000 mg acetaminophen, or placebo for 7 days. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in pain at rest, on passive motion, on weight-bearing, stiffness after rest (morning), day and night pain compared with placebo, and significantly greater relief from resting pain than acetaminophen (P < 0.05). Acetaminophen provided significantly greater improvements in day pain compared with placebo. Daily evaluations showed naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) provided superior pain relief to acetaminophen and was significantly better than acetaminophen at reducing difficulties experienced in walking several blocks and difficulties in bending, lifting, and stooping. Naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) and acetaminophen (4000 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mobility level, household tasks, and walking and bending. Patient and investigator evaluation scores were significantly higher in naproxen sodium and acetaminophen groups compared with placebo; no differences were observed between active treatments. Naproxen sodium and acetaminophen had similar safety profiles to placebo. Nonprescription doses of naproxen sodium (440/660 mg) effectively relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis. Naproxen sodium is an alternative in the initial treatment of osteoarthritis and may be preferred to acetaminophen as first-line therapy in patients with moderate or severe pain.",

            "abstract": "While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued.

            "abstract": "Background: Drug-induced liver injury is a rare but serious clinical problem. A number of drugs can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure at therapeutic doses in a very limited number of patients (<1:10,000). This idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, which is currently not predictable in preclinical safety studies, appears to depend on individual susceptibility and the inability to adapt to the cellular stress caused by a particular drug. In striking contrast to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury, drugs with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity are mostly detected during preclinical studies and do not reach the market. One notable exception is acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol), which is a safe drug at therapeutic doses but can cause severe liver injury and acute liver failure after intentional and unintentional overdoses. Key Messages: APAP overdose is responsible for more acute liver failure cases in the USA or UK than all other etiologies combined. Since APAP overdose in the mouse represents a model for the human pathophysiology, substantial progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of cell death, liver injury and recovery. More recently, emerging evidence based on mechanistic biomarker analysis in patients and studies of cell death in human hepatocytes suggests that most of the mechanisms discovered in mice also apply to patients. The rapid development of N-acetylcysteine as an antidote against APAP overdose was based on the early understanding of APAP toxicity in mice. However, despite the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in patients who present early after APAP overdose, there is a need to develop intervention strategies for late-presenting patients. Conclusions: The challenges related to APAP toxicity are to better understand the mechanisms of cell death in order to limit liver injury and prevent acute liver failure, and also to develop biomarkers that better predict as early as possible who is at risk for developing acute liver failure with poor outcome.",

            "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure worldwide, in which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released by damaged hepatocytes activates neutrophils through binding of Toll\u2010like receptor 9 (TLR9), further aggravating liver injury. Here, we demonstrated that mtDNA/TLR9 also activates a negative feedback pathway through induction of microRNA\u2010223 (miR\u2010223) to limit neutrophil overactivation and liver injury. After injection of APAP in mice, levels of miR\u2010223, the most abundant miRNAs in neutrophils, were highly elevated in neutrophils. Disruption of the miR\u2010223 gene exacerbated APAP\u2010induced hepatic neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, and injury and enhanced TLR9 ligand\u2010mediated activation of proinflammatory mediators in neutrophils. An additional deletion of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM\u20101) gene ameliorated APAP\u2010induced neutrophil infiltration and liver injury in miR\u2010223 knockout mice. In vitro experiments revealed that miR\u2010223\u2010deficient neutrophils were more susceptible to TLR9 agonist\u2010mediated induction of proinflammatory mediators and nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) signaling, whereas overexpression of miR\u2010223 attenuated these effects in neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of TLR9 signaling by either treatment with a TLR9 inhibitor or by disruption of TLR9 gene partially, but significantly, suppressed miR\u2010223 expression in neutrophils post\u2010APAP injection. In contrast, activation of TLR9 up\u2010regulated miR\u2010223 expression in neutrophils in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, activation of TLR9 up\u2010regulated miR\u2010223 by enhancing NF\u2010\u03baB binding on miR\u2010223 promoter, whereas miR\u2010223 attenuated TLR9/NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010mediated inflammation by targeting I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 expression. Collectively, up\u2010regulation of miR\u2010223 plays a key role in terminating the acute neutrophilic response and is a therapeutic target for treatment of APAP\u2010induced liver failure.

            "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure worldwide, in which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released by damaged hepatocytes activates neutrophils through binding of Toll\u2010like receptor 9 (TLR9), further aggravating liver injury. Here, we demonstrated that mtDNA/TLR9 also activates a negative feedback pathway through induction of microRNA\u2010223 (miR\u2010223) to limit neutrophil overactivation and liver injury. After injection of APAP in mice, levels of miR\u2010223, the most abundant miRNAs in neutrophils, were highly elevated in neutrophils. Disruption of the miR\u2010223 gene exacerbated APAP\u2010induced hepatic neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, and injury and enhanced TLR9 ligand\u2010mediated activation of proinflammatory mediators in neutrophils. An additional deletion of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM\u20101) gene ameliorated APAP\u2010induced neutrophil infiltration and liver injury in miR\u2010223 knockout mice. In vitro experiments revealed that miR\u2010223\u2010deficient neutrophils were more susceptible to TLR9 agonist\u2010mediated induction of proinflammatory mediators and nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) signaling, whereas overexpression of miR\u2010223 attenuated these effects in neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of TLR9 signaling by either treatment with a TLR9 inhibitor or by disruption of TLR9 gene partially, but significantly, suppressed miR\u2010223 expression in neutrophils post\u2010APAP injection. In contrast, activation of TLR9 up\u2010regulated miR\u2010223 expression in neutrophils in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, activation of TLR9 up\u2010regulated miR\u2010223 by enhancing NF\u2010\u03baB binding on miR\u2010223 promoter, whereas miR\u2010223 attenuated TLR9/NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010mediated inflammation by targeting I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 expression. Collectively, up\u2010regulation of miR\u2010223 plays a key role in terminating the acute neutrophilic response and is a therapeutic target for treatment of APAP\u2010induced liver failure.

Specific microRNAs have important roles in modulating the innate immune response and their dysregulation has been demonstrated to contribute to inflammatory diseases. MiR\u2010223 in particular, is very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It functions as key modulator for the differentiation and activation of myeloid cells. The central role of miR\u2010223 in myeloid cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage differentiation and activation has been studied extensively. MiR\u2010223 contributes to myeloid differentiation by enhancing granulopoiesis while inhibiting macrophage differentiation. Uncontrolled myeloid activation has detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. MiR\u2010223 serves as a negative feedback mechanism controlling excessive innate immune responses in the maintenance of myeloid cell homeostasis. This review summarizes several topics covering the function of miR\u2010223 in myeloid differentiation, neutrophil and macrophage functions, as well as in inflammatory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

            "abstract": "MicroRNAs were discovered more than 2 decades ago and have profound impact on diverse biological processes. Specific microRNAs have important roles in modulating the innate immune response and their dysregulation has been demonstrated to contribute to inflammatory diseases. MiR\u2010223 in particular, is very highly expressed and tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells. It functions as key modulator for the differentiation and activation of myeloid cells. The central role of miR\u2010223 in myeloid cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage differentiation and activation has been studied extensively. MiR\u2010223 contributes to myeloid differentiation by enhancing granulopoiesis while inhibiting macrophage differentiation. Uncontrolled myeloid activation has detrimental consequences in inflammatory disease. MiR\u2010223 serves as a negative feedback mechanism controlling excessive innate immune responses in the maintenance of myeloid cell homeostasis. This review summarizes several topics covering the function of miR\u2010223 in myeloid differentiation, neutrophil and macrophage functions, as well as in inflammatory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, nonmyeloid functions of miR\u2010223 are also discussed in this review. Therapeutic enhancement of miR\u2010223 to dampen inflammatory targets is also highlighted as potential treatment to control excessive innate immune responses during mucosal inflammation.",

            "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to more severe forms of liver injury including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In humans, only 20%\u201040% of patients with fatty liver progress to NASH, and mice fed a high\u2010fat diet (HFD) develop fatty liver but are resistant to NASH development. To understand how simple steatosis progresses to NASH, we examined hepatic expression of anti\u2010inflammatory microRNA\u2010223 (miR\u2010223) and found that this miRNA was highly elevated in hepatocytes in HFD\u2010fed mice and in human NASH samples. Genetic deletion of miR\u2010223 induced a full spectrum of NAFLD in long\u2010term HFD\u2010fed mice including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that, compared to wild\u2010type mice, HFD\u2010fed miR\u2010223 knockout (miR\u2010223KO) mice had greater hepatic expression of many inflammatory genes and cancer\u2010related genes, including (C\u2010X\u2010C motif) chemokine 10 (Cxcl10) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ\u2010binding motif (Taz), two well\u2010known factors that promote NASH development. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Cxcl10 and Taz are two downstream targets of miR\u2010223 and that overexpression of miR\u2010223 reduced their expression in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatic levels of miR\u2010223, CXCL10, and TAZ mRNA were elevated in human NASH samples, which positively correlated with hepatic levels of several miR\u2010223 targeted genes as well as several proinflammatory, cancer\u2010related, and fibrogenic genes. Conclusion: HFD\u2010fed miR\u2010223KO mice develop a full spectrum of NAFLD, representing a clinically relevant mouse NAFLD model; miR\u2010223 plays a key role in controlling steatosis\u2010to\u2010NASH progression by inhibiting hepatic Cxcl10 and Taz expression and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.",

            "abstract": "Background & Aims: Liver fibrosis is a common consequence of chronic liver injury and is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix mainly generated from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). At present, the mechanisms underlying liver fibrogenesis remain obscure and effective pharmacological therapies are lacking. Neutrophil-specific microRNA-223 (miR-223) plays an important role in controlling the development of various liver diseases; however, its role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis remains unclear. Methods: Liver fibrosis was induced by chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injection of miR-223 knockout (miR-223KO) mice and littermate wild-type controls. MiR-223 was overexpressed in cultured HSCs to determine its function and targets during HSC activation and proliferation. The expression of miR-223 and pri-miR-223 was examined in primary HSCs isolated from CCl4-treated mice and in cultured HSCs. The communication between HSCs and neutrophils was studied by performing in vitro co-culture experiments. Results: Genetic deletion of miR-223 exacerbated chronic CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Administration of miR-223 inhibited liver fibrosis by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)-Indian hedgehog (IHH)-GLI Family Zinc Finger 2 (GLI2) pathway via the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs. Overexpression of miR-223 also directly attenuated Gli2 as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1/\u03b2 (Pdgfra/b) expression in HSCs, thereby suppressing HSC activation and proliferation. The expression of pri-miR-223 and miR-223 was downregulated during HSC activation in vitro. Expression of pri-miR-223 was also decreased in activated HSCs in vivo in fibrotic livers but mature miR-223 expression was not reduced. Finally, in co-culture experiments, activated HSCs were able to take up miR-223-enriched extracellular vesicles from neutrophils, resulting in elevation of miR-223. Conclusion: MiR-223 restricts liver fibrosis by targeting multiple genes in hepatocytes and HSCs, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

This translational study aims to describe the patterns of intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration and its involvement in SAH pathogenesis. Immunohistochemistry analyses of explanted livers identified two SAH phenotypes despite a similar clinical presentation, one with high intrahepatic neutrophils (Neuhi), but low levels of CD8+ T cells, and vice versa. RNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1), a key factor in controlling neutrophilic ROS production, was upregulated and correlated with hepatic inflammation and disease progression. To study specifically the mechanisms related to Neuhi in AH patients and liver injury, we used the mouse model of chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and found that myeloid-specific deletion of the Ncf1 gene abolished ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation and steatosis. RNA-Seq analysis and the data from experimental models revealed that neutrophilic NCF1-dependent ROS promoted alcoholic hepatitis (AH) by inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (a key regulator of lipid metabolism) and microRNA-223 (a key antiinflammatory and antifibrotic microRNA). In conclusion, two distinct histopathological phenotypes based on liver immune phenotyping are observed in SAH patients, suggesting a separate mechanism driving liver injury and/or failure in these patients.",

            "abstract": "Intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration has been implicated in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) pathogenesis; however, the mechanism underlying neutrophil-induced injury in SAH remains obscure. This translational study aims to describe the patterns of intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration and its involvement in SAH pathogenesis. Immunohistochemistry analyses of explanted livers identified two SAH phenotypes despite a similar clinical presentation, one with high intrahepatic neutrophils (Neuhi), but low levels of CD8+ T cells, and vice versa. RNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1), a key factor in controlling neutrophilic ROS production, was upregulated and correlated with hepatic inflammation and disease progression. To study specifically the mechanisms related to Neuhi in AH patients and liver injury, we used the mouse model of chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and found that myeloid-specific deletion of the Ncf1 gene abolished ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation and steatosis. RNA-Seq analysis and the data from experimental models revealed that neutrophilic NCF1-dependent ROS promoted alcoholic hepatitis (AH) by inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (a key regulator of lipid metabolism) and microRNA-223 (a key antiinflammatory and antifibrotic microRNA). In conclusion, two distinct histopathological phenotypes based on liver immune phenotyping are observed in SAH patients, suggesting a separate mechanism driving liver injury and/or failure in these patients.",
