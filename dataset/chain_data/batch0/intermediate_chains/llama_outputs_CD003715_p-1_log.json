            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS The benefit of 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease is controversial. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the prophylactic properties of olsalazine in comparison with placebo for maintenance of remission in quiescent Crohn's colitis and/or ileocolitis. METHODS In this randomised, double blind, parallel group study of olsalazine versus placebo, 328 patients with quiescent Crohn's colitis and/or ileocolitis were recruited. Treatment consisted of olsalazine 2.0 g daily or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point of efficacy was relapse, as defined by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and by clinical relapse. Laboratory and clinical disease activity indicators were also measured. Safety analysis consisted of documentation of adverse events and laboratory values. RESULTS No differences in the frequency of termination due to relapse or time to termination due to relapse were noted between the two treatment groups (olsalazine 48.5% v placebo 45%) for either colitis or ileocolitis. The failure rate, defined as not completing the study, was significantly higher in olsalazine treated patients compared with placebo treated patients for the overall population (colitis and/or ileocolitis: olsalazine 65.4% v 53.9%; p=0.038). Similar failure rates were seen for patients with colitis. A significantly higher percentage of olsalazine treated patients experienced adverse gastrointestinal events. Drug attributed adverse events were reported more frequently in the olsalazine treated group with gastrointestinal symptoms being causally related to olsalazine treatment (olsalazine 40.7% v placebo 26.9%; p=0.010). Back pain was reported significantly more often by the placebo treated group. However, serious medical events did not differ between the two groups. Adverse events led to more early withdrawals in the olsalazine treated group than in the placebo treated group; thus average time in the study for patients in the olsalazine treatment group was significantly shorter than that of patients in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with olsalazine were more likely to terminate their participation in the trial than those taking placebo. This difference was not related to relapse of disease, as measured by CDAI and clinical measures, but rather was due to the development of intolerable adverse medical events of a non-serious nature related to the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal related events in the olsalazine treated group may be due to the difference in gastrointestinal status at baseline which favoured the placebo treatment group.",

            "abstract": "Mesalazine is a safe drug, although adverse events may be seen in a minority of patients. This applies also to pregnant women and children. The role of mesalazine in combination therapy to improve efficacy and concomitant drug pharmacokinetics, or in chemoprevention against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related colonic carcinoma has not yet been completely elucidated. Therapeutic success of mesalazine may be optimized by a combination of high dose and low frequency of dosage to improve compliance. Therefore, due to its superior safety profile and pharmacokinetic characteristics, mesalazine is preferable to sulphasalazine. This paper reviews the literature concerning mechanisms of action, indications and off-label use, pharmacokinetic properties and formulations, therapeutic efficacy, compliance, paediatric indications, chemoprevention, and safety issues and adverse event profile of mesalazine treatment versus sulphasalazine. It also highlights these controversies in order to clarify the potential benefits of mesalazines in IBD therapy and evidence for its use.",

            "abstract": "Mesalazine is a safe drug, although adverse events may be seen in a minority of patients. This applies also to pregnant women and children. The role of mesalazine in combination therapy to improve efficacy and concomitant drug pharmacokinetics, or in chemoprevention against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related colonic carcinoma has not yet been completely elucidated. Therapeutic success of mesalazine may be optimized by a combination of high dose and low frequency of dosage to improve compliance. Therefore, due to its superior safety profile and pharmacokinetic characteristics, mesalazine is preferable to sulphasalazine. This paper reviews the literature concerning mechanisms of action, indications and off-label use, pharmacokinetic properties and formulations, therapeutic efficacy, compliance, paediatric indications, chemoprevention, and safety issues and adverse event profile of mesalazine treatment versus sulphasalazine. It also highlights these controversies in order to clarify the potential benefits of mesalazines in IBD therapy and evidence for its use.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Studies indicated that 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) may influence the metabolism of thiopurines; however, conclusions were restricted as a result of number of patients or study design.AIM:To determine the influence of 5-ASA on thiopurine metabolism, we performed a prospective multicenter pharmacokinetic interaction study of two different 5-ASA dosages (2 g daily followed by 4 g daily) in 26 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients during steady-state AZA or 6-MP therapy.RESULTS:The 4-wk coadministration of 2 g 5-ASA daily, followed by a 4-wk period of 4 g 5-ASA daily, led to a statistical significant increase of 40% (absolute 84 pmol/8 \u00d7 108 RBC) and 70% (absolute 154 pmol/8 \u00d7 108 RBC) in 6-thioguaninenucleotide levels (6-TGN), respectively.

            "abstract": "Data from both basic research and clinical experience continue to suggest that mesalamines and thiopurines are effective and efficient for the maintenance of remission of inflammatory bowel diseases. Several decades following the formalization of their indications, attention on these two drugs has been fostered by recent achievements. Demonstration of the ability of mesalamine to activate a colonocyte differentiation factor has shed light on its chemopreventive effects on colorectal cancer; in addition to their anti-proliferative efficacy, thiopurines have been shown to be specific regulators of apoptosis. The two drugs are often co-administered in clinical practice. Recent advancements have shown that mesalamines exert a positive synergism in this context, insofar as they can inhibit side-methylation of thiopurines and hasten the function of the main immunosuppressive pathways. Considering that up to 40% of patients cannot tolerate thiopurines, such renovated targets have stimulated efforts to improve compliance by research on the toxicity mechanisms. The definition of genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes of thiopurine metabolism, and the uncovering of synergistic drug interactions, such as that with allopurinol, are just two of the results of such efforts. Interaction between basic research and clinical practice has continued to inform indications and refine the prescriptions of mesalamines and thiopurines; these have not been restrained (they have been implemented in some cases) by the advent of the novel biological molecules with anti-cytokine activity.",

            "abstract": "5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine) are the most common drugs used as a maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis. A considerable proportion of these patients develop corticosteroid dependency, and thiopurines are the standard treatment in this scenario. Dual prescriptions of both thiopurines and 5-ASA are common practice in steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis, in an attempt to optimize the efficacy of therapy. On the one hand, the potential protective role of 5-ASA against colorectal cancer argues in favour of prescription of both medications. The possible synergism between the two drugs, because of the inhibition of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity by 5-ASA, has been postulated as another justification for dual prescription. However, existing evidence does not support that this combined strategy is superior to monotherapy with thiopurines. On the other hand, in patients showing prolonged disease remission, the possibility of discontinuing maintenance treatment can be considered on an individualized basis. The high frequency of relapses after thiopurine withdrawal should always be taken into account, but the potential adverse effects of the medication also need to be considered. A properly indicated treatment with thiopurines may need to be continued for life in many patients.",

            "abstract": "Azathioprine is a first\u2010line drug used to maintain the remission of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As a prodrug, azathioprine is metabolised to produce active 6\u2010thioguanine nucleotides (6\u2010TGN). There are large individual variations in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of 6\u2010TGN in patients with IBD. Here, we aimed to develop a model to quantitatively investigate factors that affect 6\u2010TGN pharmacokinetics to formulate a dosage guideline for azathioprine. Data were collected prospectively from 100 adult patients with IBD who were receiving azathioprine. Patients were genotyped for two single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (TPMT*3C c.719A > G and NUDT15 c.415C > T). Using high\u2010performance liquid chromatography, we measured 156 steady\u2010state trough concentrations of 6\u2010TGN within the range 0.09 to 1.16 mg/L (ie 133\u20101733 pmol per 8 \u00d7 108 RBC). The covariates analysed included sex, age, body\u2010weight, laboratory tests and concomitant medications. A population pharmacokinetic model was established using \u201cnon\u2010linear mixed\u2010effects modelling\u201d software and the \u201cfirst\u2010order conditional estimation method with interaction.\u201d Body\u2010weight, TPMT*3C polymorphisms and co\u2010therapy with mesalazine were found to be important factors influencing the clearance of 6\u2010TGN. A dosage guideline for azathioprine was developed based on the PPK model that enables individualised azathioprine dosing in adult patients with different body\u2010weights, TPMT*3C genotypes and co\u2010administration with mesalazine.",
