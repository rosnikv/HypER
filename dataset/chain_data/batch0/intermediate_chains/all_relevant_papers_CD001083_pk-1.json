        "title": "Slow progression of joint damage in early rheumatoid arthritis treated with cyclosporin A.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the ability of low-dose cyclosporin A (CsA) to control radiologic disease progression, and to assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of CsA, compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), in patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this long-term, multicenter, prospective, open, blinded end point, randomized trial, 361 consenting patients with early (<4 years since diagnosis) active RA were enrolled. Of the eligible patients, 167 were treated with CsA at 3 mg/kg/day, and 173 with DMARDs. The decision to use conventional antirheumatic drugs as controls was based on the fact that joint erosion could be expected to occur after 1 year regardless of the type of DMARD being used. The possibility of switching therapies in both groups was intended to keep the largest possible number of patients in the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlinded evaluation of hand and foot radiographs after 12 months of treatment showed that CsA led to a significant (P < 0.001) delay in the mean +/- SD progression in the eroded joint count (1.3 +/- 3.1 versus 2.4 +/- 3.0 for the control group) and in the joint damage score (3.6 +/- 8.9 versus 6.9 +/- 9.1 for the control group), both measured by the Larsen-Dale method. When only the patients without erosion at baseline were considered (37 in the CsA-treated group and 54 in the control group), erosion appeared in only 10.8% of the CsA-treated patients, but in 51.8% of the controls (P = 0.00005). Low-dose CsA was as effective as traditional DMARDs in controlling clinical symptoms. Maintenance on the initially prescribed treatment regimen (\"survival on treatment\") was also better at 12 months with CsA than with DMARDs (89.2% versus 77.5%; P = 0.002). The tolerability of CsA was acceptable.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese 12-month results suggest that low-dose CsA decreases the rate of further joint damage in previously involved joints as well as the rate of new joint involvement in previously uninvolved joints, in patients with early RA.",

        "title": "Low dose cyclosporine in early rheumatoid arthritis: effective and safe after two years of therapy when compared with chloroquine.",
        "abstract": "Forty-four patients with early RA who had participated in a six months double-blind trial, comparing cyclosporine A (CsA) (n = 22) with chloroquine (Chl) (n = 22), were followed for a further 18 months irrespective of their treatment status. At two years follow up, the mean CsA dose was 2.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/day (n = 15) and the dose of Chl (n = 11) was 100 mg/day in every patient. Maximal difference in efficacy (represented by the percentage of patients who fulfilled the Paulus 50% response) was reached at one year (CsA group: 68% and Chl group: 36%; p = 0.07). At two years, the differences in efficacy and toxicity between the two groups had diminished. The conclusions of this follow-up study are: 1. maximal efficacy of low dose CsA in early RA patients is reached after one year of therapy. 2. CsA can maintain clinical efficacy and safety comparable to Chl for a period of at least two years.",

        "abstract": "A double-blind, randomized comparison between parenteral gold therapy (PGT) and cyclosporin A (CyA) vs PGT and placebo during 6 months was performed in 40 RA patients experiencing a decreasing effect of ongoing PGT. Patients' overall assessment of health was the only efficacy variable significantly better in the CyA- and PGT-treated vs the placebo- and PGT-treated group. Higher blood pressure and more signs of renal impairment were found during the 6 months treatment in the former compared with the latter group. Six months after the end of the combination therapy, a higher potassium value in the CyA-treated group was the only difference. In conclusion, no effects additional to those expected with single-drug therapy or additional risks of side-effects of either drug were found when combining low-dose CyA with ongoing PGT in RA patients with long disease duration.",
