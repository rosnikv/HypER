            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 46 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 48-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of cyclosporine was conducted in 122 patients with active RA. Patients were evaluated by objective and subjective clinical and radiologic measurements at baseline and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStatistically significant improvement and clinically important changes were seen for the number of tender joints, number of swollen joints, pain score, duration of morning stiffness, and Lee's functional index in the cyclosporine-treated group at the end of the study. Radiographic examination showed that cyclosporine was capable of retarding joint destruction. In the cyclosporine-treated group, serum creatinine levels increased by 17.5 mumoles/liter (23%) at week 24 and by 21.8 mumoles/liter (26%) at week 48. There was no significant difference in mean serum creatinine levels in patients treated with cyclosporine alone and those treated with cyclosporine plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Five patients had to be treated with antihypertensive drugs, and 2 patients were withdrawn from the study because of increased serum creatinine.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe study shows that cyclosporine seems to have disease-modifying effects in RA.",

Of the eligible patients, 167 were treated with CsA at 3 mg/kg/day, and 173 with DMARDs. The decision to use conventional antirheumatic drugs as controls was based on the fact that joint erosion could be expected to occur after 1 year regardless of the type of DMARD being used. The possibility of switching therapies in both groups was intended to keep the largest possible number of patients in the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlinded evaluation of hand and foot radiographs after 12 months of treatment showed that CsA led to a significant (P < 0.001) delay in the mean +/- SD progression in the eroded joint count (1.3 +/- 3.1 versus 2.4 +/- 3.0 for the control group) and in the joint damage score (3.6 +/- 8.9 versus 6.9 +/- 9.1 for the control group), both measured by the Larsen-Dale method. When only the patients without erosion at baseline were considered (37 in the CsA-treated group and 54 in the control group), erosion appeared in only 10.8% of the CsA-treated patients, but in 51.8% of the controls (P = 0.00005). Low-dose CsA was as effective as traditional DMARDs in controlling clinical symptoms. Maintenance on the initially prescribed treatment regimen (\"survival on treatment\") was also better at 12 months with CsA than with DMARDs (89.2% versus 77.5%; P = 0.002). The tolerability of CsA was acceptable.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese 12-month results suggest that low-dose CsA decreases the rate of further joint damage in previously involved joints as well as the rate of new joint involvement in previously uninvolved joints, in patients with early RA.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine whether induced mast cell activation/degranulation in rheumatoid synovial explants modulates the production of prostaglandin E (PGE2), and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) collagenase 1, gelatinase A, and stromelysin 1. METHODS Synovial explant cultures were treated either with rabbit IgG anti-human IgE as a mast cell (MC) secretagogue or with non-immune rabbit IgG as controls. After 20 hours conditioned medium was assayed for the release of MC tryptase, PGE2, collagenase 1, gelatinase A, and stromelysin 1 using radioimmunoassay, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, and zymogram techniques; tissue explants were examined immunohistologically for the relative distributions of MC tryptase, collagenase 1, and stromelysin 1. RESULTS Over a 20 hour incubation period the MC secretagogue treated explants showed a significant increase in the quantities of released tryptase and PGE2 compared with controls. By contrast, the three MMPs showed variable values between experiments in response to MC activation; no reproducible trend of either an increased or decreased production of each MMP over control values was evident. Each MMP initially appeared as an inactive precursor form; collagenase 1 and stromelysin 1 were more effectively processed to active forms in the MC activated cultures. Immunolocalisation studies of MC activated explants showed that areas of extracellular tryptase were commonly associated with the local production of both collagenase 1 and stromelysin 1. CONCLUSION MC degranulation induced artificially in rheumatoid synovial explant cultures consistently resulted in an increased production of PGE2 but had variable effects on the quantification of released collagenase 1, gelatinase A, and stromelysin 1. Such observations support the concept that activated synovial MCs within their native environment stimulate the production of non-MC derived PGE2 and may contribute to the regulation and processing of specific MMPs; both aspects represent important components of the inflammatory and degradative processes of the rheumatoid lesion.",

We examined their immunolocalization with tryptase of a mast cell marker, using the biopsy specimens from 12 cases. In the epithelioid granuloma, no mast cells were detected in any of the cases, although a small number of them (4.6 +/- 2.4) were seen at the fibrous stroma around the granuloma in all cases. By contrast, in all cases, increased mast cells (28 +/- 7.2) localized at the thyroid tissue-regenerative site where both thyroid folliculogenesis and angiogenesis take place. To elucidate possible roles of mast cells in the disease, we also examined their immunoexpressions of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which affect thyroid folliculogenesis and angiogenesis. In all 12 cases, mast cells displayed all of these growth factors in a manner not specific to the infiltrating site. The data suggest that growth factor-expressing mast cells may play crucial roles in the thyroid tissue repair of subacute thyroiditis, modulating thyroid folliculogenesis and angiogenesis; and that the multifunctionality of the cells may be partly dependent on their expressions of various growth factors.",
