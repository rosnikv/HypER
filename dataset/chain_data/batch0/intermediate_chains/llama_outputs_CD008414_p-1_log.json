            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNo therapy has been shown to reliably prevent the evolution of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

The aim of the current trial was to compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and mesalamine with placebo for the prevention of clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection and ileocolic anastomosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive centers randomized 131 patients to receive 6-MP (50 mg), mesalamine (3 g), or placebo daily in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Patients had clinical assessments at 7 weeks and then every 3 months; colonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months; and small bowel series at 12 and 24 months. End points were clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic recurrence rates at 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical recurrence rates (intent to treat) by life-table analysis at 24 months were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-68%), 58% (95% CI, 41%-75%), and 77% (95% CI, 61%-91%) in patients receiving 6-MP, mesalamine, and placebo, respectively. Endoscopic recurrence rates were 43% (95% CI, 28%-63%), 63% (95% CI, 47%-79%), and 64% (95% CI, 46%-81%), and radiographic recurrence rates were 33% (95% CI, 19%-54%), 46% (95% CI, 29%-66%), and 49% (95% CI, 30%-72%), respectively. 6-MP was more effective than placebo ( P < 0.05) at preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence over 2 years. Patient withdrawals resulted in 69% of the study population evaluable for the clinical recurrence end point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n6-MP, 50 mg daily, was more effective than placebo at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease and should be considered as a maintenance therapy after ileocolic resection.",

The aim of the study was to compare ileocolonoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) for the detection of postoperative recurrence in CD. Methods: WCE and ileocolonoscopy were performed within six months following surgery in 32 prospectively enrolled patients. Two independent observers interpreted the results of WCE. Recurrence in the neoterminal ileum was defined by a Rutgeerts score \u2a7e1. When observers at WCE did not concur, WCE results were considered as either true negative or true positive and sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to both assumptions. Results: Recurrence occurred in 21 patients (68%) and was detected by ileocolonoscopy in 19 patients. Sensitivity was 90% and specificity 100%. Sensitivity of WCE was 62% and 76% and specificity was 100% and 90%, respectively, depending on assumptions. There was a correlation between the severity of the lesions measured by both methods (p<0.05). Lesions located outside the scope of conventional endoscopy were detected by WCE in two thirds of patients with excellent interobserver agreement (kappa >0.9) for all lesions with the exception of ulceration (kappa\u200a=\u200a0.7). Conclusions: The sensitivity of WCE in detecting recurrence in the neoterminal ileum was inferior to that of ileocolonoscopy. In contrast, WCE detected lesions outside the scope of ileocolonoscopy in more than two thirds of patients. Additional follow up studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of such lesions.

            "abstract": "Background: The best available tool to assess recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) is ileocolonoscopy (CC). Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) are noninvasive techniques able to detect small bowel lesions. In a prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the usefulness of SICUS and WCE for assessing postoperative recurrence of CD 1 year after surgery, using CC as the gold standard. Methods: Twenty\u2010two patients (11 men, median age 33 years, range 22\u201367 years) undergoing ileocolonic resection for CD were prospectively followed from July 2003 to May 2006, with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) used for clinical assessment every 3 months for 1 year. At 1 year, recurrence was assessed by SICUS and CC, followed by WCE. CD recurrence was assessed by CC (Rutgeerts score). SICUS was performed after ingestion of polyethylene glycol, and WCE was performed with Given M2A equipment. Results: At 1 year, all 22 patients had inactive CD (CDAI < 150). In 5 patients, WCE was not performed because of luminal narrowing or stenosis. Seventeen of the 22 patients had all 3 techniques performed. CC detected recurrence in 21 of 22 patients. Lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 22 patients (1 false positive). When considering only the 17 patients studied by all 3 techniques, recurrence was detected by CC in 16 of 17 patients, whereas lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 17 patients (16 true positives [TPs], 1 FP) and by WCE in 16 of 17 patients (16 TPs, 1 true negative).

            "abstract": "Background: The best available tool to assess recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) is ileocolonoscopy (CC). Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) are noninvasive techniques able to detect small bowel lesions. In a prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to investigate the usefulness of SICUS and WCE for assessing postoperative recurrence of CD 1 year after surgery, using CC as the gold standard. Methods: Twenty\u2010two patients (11 men, median age 33 years, range 22\u201367 years) undergoing ileocolonic resection for CD were prospectively followed from July 2003 to May 2006, with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) used for clinical assessment every 3 months for 1 year. At 1 year, recurrence was assessed by SICUS and CC, followed by WCE. CD recurrence was assessed by CC (Rutgeerts score). SICUS was performed after ingestion of polyethylene glycol, and WCE was performed with Given M2A equipment. Results: At 1 year, all 22 patients had inactive CD (CDAI < 150). In 5 patients, WCE was not performed because of luminal narrowing or stenosis. Seventeen of the 22 patients had all 3 techniques performed. CC detected recurrence in 21 of 22 patients. Lesions compatible with recurrence were detected by SICUS in all 22 patients (1 false positive).

Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) visualizes the small bowel lesions in CD, although its role after curative resection is undefined. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of SICUS in assessing CD recurrence after ileocolonic resection when using ileocolonoscopy as a gold standard. The correlation between the bowel wall thickness (BWT) measured by SICUS and the endoscopic score of recurrence was also assessed. Methods: The analysis included 72 CD patients with ileocolonic resection requiring ileocolonoscopy, undergoing SICUS within 6 months. Recurrence was assessed by ileocolonoscopy using the Rutgeerts' score. SICUS was performed after PEG ingestion and findings compatible with recurrence included: increased BWT (>3 mm), bowel dilation (>25 mm) or stricture (<10 mm). Results: Ileocolonoscopy detected recurrence in 67/72 (93%) patients. SICUS detected findings compatible with recurrence in 62/72 (86%) patients (5 false negative (FN), 4 false positive (FP), 1 true negative (TN), 62 true positive (TP)), showing a 92.5% sensitivity, 20% specificity, and 87.5% accuracy for detecting CD recurrence. The BWT detected by SICUS was correlated with the Rutgeerts' score (P = 0.0001; r = 0.67). The median BWT, the extent of the ileal lesions, and the prestenotic dilation were higher in patients with an endoscopic degree of recurrence \u22653 versus \u22642 (P < 0.001) and the lumen diameter was lower in patients with a Rutgeerts' score \u22653 versus \u22642 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Although SICUS and ileocolonoscopy provide different views of the small bowel, SICUS shows a significant correlation with the endoscopic findings.

Being a chronic disorder that with time develops into a disabling disease, it is important to monitor the severity of inflammation to assess the efficacy of medication, rule out complications, and prevent progression. This is particularly true now that the goals of treatment are mucosal healing and deep remission. Endoscopy has always been the gold standard for assessing mucosal activity in CD, but its use is limited by its invasiveness and its inability to examine the small intestine, proximal to the terminal ileum. Enteroscopy and the less invasive small bowel capsule endoscopy enable the small bowel to be thoroughly explored and scores are emerging for classifying small bowel disease activity. Cross-sectional imaging techniques (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography) are emerging as valid tools for monitoring CD patients, assessing inflammatory activity in the mucosa and the transmucosal extent of the disease, and for excluding extra-intestinal complications. Neither endoscopy nor imaging are suitable for assessing patients frequently, however. Noninvasive markers such as C-reactive protein, and fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin, are therefore useful to confirm the inflammatory burden of the disease and to identify patients requiring further investigations.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe primary objective of our study was to examine the association between contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) parameters and established gray-scale ultrasound with color Doppler imaging (CDI) for the determination of disease activity in patients with Crohn disease. Our secondary objective was to develop quantitative time-signal intensity curve thresholds for disease activity.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nOne hundred twenty-seven patients with Crohn disease underwent ultrasound with CDI and CEUS. Reviewers graded wall thickness, inflammatory fat, and mural blood flow as showing remission or inflammation (mild, moderate, or severe). If both gray-scale ultrasound and CDI predicted equal levels of disease activity, the studies were considered concordant. If ultrasound images suggested active disease not supported by CDI findings, the ultrasound results for disease activity were indeterminate. Time-signal intensity curves from CEUS were acquired with calculation of peak enhancement (PE), and AUCs. Interobserver variation and associations between PE and ultrasound parameters were examined. Multiclass ROC analysis was used to develop CEUS thresholds for activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-six (76%) studies were concordant, 19 of which showed severe disease, and 31 (24%) studies were indeterminate. Kappa analyses revealed good interobserver agreement on grades for CDI (\u03ba = 0.76) and ultrasound (\u03ba = 0.80) assessments. PE values on CEUS and wall thickness showed good association with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for the entire population (\u03c1 = 0.62, p < 0.01) and for the concordant group (\u03c1 = 0.70, p < 0.01). Multiclass ROC analyses of the concordant group using wall thickness alone as the reference standard showed cutoff points of 18.2 dB for differentiating mild versus moderate activity (sensitivity, 89.0% and specificity, 87.0%) and 23.0 dB for differentiating moderate versus severe (sensitivity, 90% and specificity, 86.8%). Almost identical cutoff points were observed when using ultrasound global assessment as the reference standard: using 18.2 dB to differentiate mild versus moderate activity yielded sensitivity of 89.2% and specificity of 90.9% and using 22.9 dB to differentiate moderate versus severe activity yielded sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 83.1%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nQuantitative CEUS parameters integrated into inflammatory assessments with ultrasound reduce indeterminate results and improve disease activity level determinations.",

MRE images were reviewed to identify strictures on enteric phase T1-weighted fat-suppressed images, that were matched with sites of histologic sectioning. Regions of interest were drawn over the bowel wall and texture analysis was performed using TexRAD software (Cambridge, UK), with skewness, mean, entropy and standard deviation parameters assessed.

Multivariate logistic regression and analysis of variance were performed to identify texture features associated with stricture fibrosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-four bowel segments from 25 patients (mean age 16\u200a\u00b1\u200a2 years) with imaging-histologic correlation were included. Of note, all strictures included had undergone surgical resection with MRE imaging available within 30 days. The histologic distribution of these bowel segments included 9 segments that showed active inflammation without fibrosis, 23 segments that showed only fibrosis, and 32 mixed segments with concomitant active inflammation and fibrosis.

Bowel fibrosis was histologically classified as none-mild or moderate-severe. In the training cohort, 1454 radiomic features were extracted from venous-phase CTE, and a machine learning-based RM was developed based on the reproducible features using logistic regression. The RM was validated in an independent external test cohort recruited from three centres. The diagnostic performance of RM was compared with two radiologists' visual interpretation of CTE using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RM for distinguishing moderate-severe from none-mild intestinal fibrosis was 0.888 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.818-0.957). In the test cohort, the RM showed robust performance across three centres with an AUC of 0.816 (95% CI: 0.706-0.926), 0.724 (95% CI: 0.526-0.923), and 0.750 (95% CI: 0.560-0.940), respectively. Moreover, the RM was more accurate than visual interpretations by either radiologist (#1 AUC=0.554; #2 AUC=0.598; both P<0.001) in the test cohort. Decision curve analysis showed that the RM provided a better net benefit to predicting intestinal fibrosis than the radiologists.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA CTE-based RM allows for accurate characterisation of intestinal fibrosis in CD.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this article is to develop a deep learning automatic segmentation model for the segmentation of Crohn's disease (CD) lesions in computed tomography enterography (CTE) images. Additionally, the radiomics features extracted from the segmented CD lesions will be analyzed and multiple machine learning classifiers will be built to distinguish CD activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective study with 2 sets of CTE image data. Segmentation datasets were used to establish nnU-Net neural network's automatic segmentation model. The classification dataset was processed using the automatic segmentation model to obtain segmentation results and extract radiomics features. The most optimal features were then selected to build 5 machine learning classifiers to distinguish CD activity. The performance of the automatic segmentation model was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient, while the performance of the machine learning classifier was evaluated using the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe segmentation dataset had 84 CTE examinations of CD patients (mean age 31 \u00b1\u200513 years\u2005, 60 males), and the classification dataset had 193 (mean age 31 \u00b1\u200512 years\u2005, 136 males). The deep learning segmentation model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.824 on the testing set. The logistic regression model showed the best performance among the 5 classifiers in the testing set, with an area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.862, 0.697, 0.840, and 0.759, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe automated segmentation model accurately segments CD lesions, and machine learning classifier distinguishes CD activity well. This method can assist radiologists in promptly and precisely evaluating CD activity.",
