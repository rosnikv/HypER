In this multicenter study, the efficacy and tolerability of perindopril added to continuing hydrochlorothiazide therapy were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate (stage I and II), essential hypertension. Two hundred fifty\u2010two patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg to 114 mmHg were treated for 4 weeks with open\u2010label hydrochlorothiazide at 25 mg/day. The 208 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was \u226590 mmHg at the end of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy entered a 12\u2010week, double\u2010blind treatment, where placebo or perindopril were added to the 25\u2010mg/day hydrochlorothiazide therapy as follows: placebo (n = 50) and doses of perindopril at 2 mg/day (n = 52), 4 mg/day (n = 53), and 8 mg/day (n = 53). The perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations decreased both supine systolic blood pressure and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, for perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/day, respectively; there was no difference among the three drug groups. Placebo decreased blood pressure by 1.6/2.0 mmHg, an effect that was significantly lower compared with perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations. Adverse events were mild and similar among all treatment groups, except cough, which was 4.0%, 3.9%, 7.6%, and 13.2% for placebo and perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. The results of this multicenter study indicate that the combination of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide is safe and effective in lowering blood pressure. The findings also demonstrate that lower doses of perindopril are as effective as higher doses when combined with hydrochlorothiazide.",

The perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations decreased both supine systolic blood pressure and supine diastolic blood pressure by 10.3/6.7, 9.6/8.0, and 9.3/6.3 mmHg, for perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/day, respectively; there was no difference among the three drug groups. Placebo decreased blood pressure by 1.6/2.0 mmHg, an effect that was significantly lower compared with perindopril\u2014hydrochlorothiazide combinations. Adverse events were mild and similar among all treatment groups, except cough, which was 4.0%, 3.9%, 7.6%, and 13.2% for placebo and perindopril doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. The results of this multicenter study indicate that the combination of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide is safe and effective in lowering blood pressure. The findings also demonstrate that lower doses of perindopril are as effective as higher doses when combined with hydrochlorothiazide.",

ARBs have been shown to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy.

The change of mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to week 10 (W10) were studied using a covariance analysis model. The percentage of controlled patients at W10 was compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. Of 833 patients enrolled from 14 countries, the intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 795 (mean age 58 \u00b1 12 years, female 60%, obesity 38%, diabetes 22%). At W6, mean SBP decrease was: E \u2212 28.8 mmHg vs L \u2212 26.3 mmHg (p = 0.02). At W10, there was similar mean SBP decrease: E \u2212 29.5 mmHg vs L \u2212 31.0 mmHg (p = 0.14). The control rate at W10 was 58% (E) and 64% (L), p = 0.06. Serious adverse events were more frequent in E (2.5% vs 0.7%, p = 0.044). Both early and late titration regimens provide similar BP decrease and control rate.",

            "abstract": "AbstractThiazide diuretics are associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia. The aim of this study was to investigate possible predictors of thiazide-induced hyponatremia.A total of 48 patients admitted to the ward or to the emergency department due to severe thiazide-induced hyponatremia (Na\u200a<\u200a125\u200ammol/L) were enrolled in our study as the case group. Another 211 hypertensive patients with normal sodium levels after treatment with thiazide diuretics were selected as the control group. Twelve tag single nucleotide polymorphism markers were selected from the Potassium Channel, Inwardly Rectifying Subfamily J, Member 1 (KCNJ1) gene: rs1231254, rs2238009, rs1148058, rs675482, rs673614, rs12795437, rs2855800, rs2509585, rs3016774, rs881333, rs4529890, and rs7116606. Clinical and genetic parameters between patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia and the control group were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze data.The patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia were older (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), predominantly female (P\u200a=\u200a0.008), had a lower mean body mass index (BMI) (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and more commonly used angiotensin II receptor antagonist (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and spironolactone (P\u200a=\u200a0.007) compared with the control groups. Analysis with multivariate logistic regression revealed that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08\u20131.19, P\u200a<\u200a0.001), female gender (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 1.54\u201313.11, P\u200a=\u200a0.006), BMI (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69\u20130.93, P\u200a=\u200a0.003), and KCNJ1 rs2509585\u200aC/T or T/T polymorphisms (OR, 5.75; 95% CI, 1.25\u201326.45, P\u200a=\u200a0.03) were independent predictors for thiazide-induced hyponatremia.Older female patients with lower BMIs and KCNJ1 rs2509585\u200aC/T or T/T polymorphisms were more likely to develop thiazide-induced hyponatremia.",

            "abstract": "Carbamazepine (CBZ, Tegretol\u00ae) is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain; however, several unwanted effects of this drug have been noticed. Therefore, the regulatory actions of CBZ on ionic currents in electrically excitable cells need to be reappraised, although its efficacy in suppressing voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) has been disclosed. This study was undertaken to explore the modifications produced by CBZ on ionic currents (e.g., INa and erg-mediated K+ current [IK(erg)]) measured from Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. In these cells, we found that this drug differentially suppressed the peak (transient, INa(T)) and sustained (late, INa(L)) components of INa in a concentration-dependent manner with effective IC50 of 56 and 18 \u03bcM, respectively. The overall current\u2013voltage relationship of INa(T) with or without the addition of CBZ remained unchanged; however, the strength (i.e., \u2206area) in the window component of INa (INa(W)) evoked by the short ascending ramp pulse (Vramp) was overly lessened in the CBZ presence. Tefluthrin (Tef), a synthetic pyrethroid, known to stimulate INa, augmented the strength of the voltage-dependent hysteresis (Hys(V)) of persistent INa (INa(P)) in response to the isosceles-triangular Vramp; moreover, further application of CBZ attenuated Tef-mediated accentuation of INa(P)\u2019s Hys(V). With a two-step voltage protocol, the recovery of INa(T) inactivation seen in Neuro-2a cells became progressively slowed by adding CBZ; however, the cumulative inhibition of INa(T) evoked by pulse train stimulation was enhanced during exposure to this drug. Neuro-2a-cell exposure to CBZ (100 \u03bcM), the magnitude of erg-mediated K+ current measured throughout the entire voltage-clamp steps applied was mildly inhibited. The docking results regarding the interaction of CBZ and voltage-gate Na+ (NaV) channel predicted the ability of CBZ to bind to some amino-acid residues in NaV due to the existence of a hydrogen bond or hydrophobic contact. It is conceivable from the current investigations that the INa (INa(T), INa(L), INa(W), and INa(P)) residing in Neuro-2a cells are susceptible to being suppressed by CBZ, and that its block on INa(L) is larger than that on INa(T). Collectively, the magnitude and gating of NaV channels produced by the CBZ presence might have an impact on its anticonvulsant and analgesic effects occurring in vivo.",

The overall current\u2013voltage relationship of INa(T) with or without the addition of CBZ remained unchanged; however, the strength (i.e., \u2206area) in the window component of INa (INa(W)) evoked by the short ascending ramp pulse (Vramp) was overly lessened in the CBZ presence. Tefluthrin (Tef), a synthetic pyrethroid, known to stimulate INa, augmented the strength of the voltage-dependent hysteresis (Hys(V)) of persistent INa (INa(P)) in response to the isosceles-triangular Vramp; moreover, further application of CBZ attenuated Tef-mediated accentuation of INa(P)\u2019s Hys(V). With a two-step voltage protocol, the recovery of INa(T) inactivation seen in Neuro-2a cells became progressively slowed by adding CBZ; however, the cumulative inhibition of INa(T) evoked by pulse train stimulation was enhanced during exposure to this drug. Neuro-2a-cell exposure to CBZ (100 \u03bcM), the magnitude of erg-mediated K+ current measured throughout the entire voltage-clamp steps applied was mildly inhibited. The docking results regarding the interaction of CBZ and voltage-gate Na+ (NaV) channel predicted the ability of CBZ to bind to some amino-acid residues in NaV due to the existence of a hydrogen bond or hydrophobic contact. It is conceivable from the current investigations that the INa (INa(T), INa(L), INa(W), and INa(P)) residing in Neuro-2a cells are susceptible to being suppressed by CBZ, and that its block on INa(L) is larger than that on INa(T). Collectively, the magnitude and gating of NaV channels produced by the CBZ presence might have an impact on its anticonvulsant and analgesic effects occurring in vivo.",

            "title": "Inhibition of Voltage-Gated Na+ Currents Exerted by KB-R7943 (2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea), an Inhibitor of Na+-Ca2+ Exchanging Process",
            "abstract": "KB-R7943, an isothiourea derivative, has been recognized as an inhibitor in the reverse mode of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanging process. This compound was demonstrated to prevent intracellular Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in intact cells; however, it is much less effective at preventing extracellular Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux. Therefore, whether or how this compound may produce any perturbations on other types of ionic currents, particularly on voltage-gated Na+ current (INa), needs to be further studied. In this study, the whole-cell current recordings demonstrated that upon abrupt depolarization in pituitary GH3 cells, the exposure to KB-R7943 concentration-dependently depressed the transient (INa(T)) or late component (INa(L)) of INa with an IC50 value of 11 or 0.9 \u03bcM, respectively. Likewise, the dissociation constant for the KB-R7943-mediated block of INa on the basis of a minimum reaction scheme was estimated to be 0.97 \u03bcM. The presence of benzamil or amiloride could suppress the INa(L) magnitude. The instantaneous window Na+ current (INa(W)) activated by abrupt ascending ramp voltage (Vramp) was suppressed by adding KB-R7943; however, subsequent addition of deltamethrin or tefluthrin (Tef) effectively reversed KB-R7943-inhibted INa(W). With prolonged duration of depolarizing pulses, the INa(L) amplitude became exponentially decreased; moreover, KB-R7943 diminished INa(L) magnitude. The resurgent Na+ current (INa(R)) evoked by a repolarizing Vramp was also suppressed by adding this compound; moreover, subsequent addition of ranolazine or Tef further diminished or reversed, respectively, its reduction in INa(R) magnitude. The persistent Na+ current (INa(P)) activated by sinusoidal voltage waveform became enhanced by Tef; however, subsequent application of KB-R7943 counteracted Tef-stimulated INa(P). The docking prediction reflected that there seem to be molecular interactions of this molecule with the hNaV1.2 or hNaV1.7 channels. Collectively, this study highlights evidence showing that KB-R7943 has the propensity to perturb the magnitude and gating kinetics of INa (e.g., INa(T), INa(L), INa(W), INa(R), and INa(P)) and that the NaV channels appear to be important targets for the in vivo actions of KB-R7943 or other relevant compounds.",
