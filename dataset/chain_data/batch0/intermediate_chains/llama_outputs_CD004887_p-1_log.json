            "abstract": "A beneficial effect of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in Child\u2010Pugh class B and C patients with cirrhosis who have variceal bleeding has been suggested. This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in patients with advanced cirrhosis and active variceal bleeding. At 31 hospitals in an emergency setting, 256 patients (Child\u2010Pugh > 8; Child\u2010Pugh B = 26%, C = 74%) were randomized equally to: placebo; 600 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa (200 + 4\u00d7 100 \u03bcg/kg); or 300 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa (200 + 100 \u03bcg/kg). Dosing was intravenous at 0, 2, 8, 14, and 20 hours after endoscopy, in addition to standard vasoactive, prophylactic antibiotic, and endoscopic treatment. The primary composite endpoint consisted of failure to control 24\u2010hour bleeding, or failure to prevent rebleeding or death at day 5. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and 42\u2010day mortality. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Administration of rFVIIa had no significant effect on the composite endpoint compared with placebo (P = 0.37). There was no significant difference in 5\u2010day mortality between groups; however, 42\u2010day mortality was significantly lower with 600 \u03bcg/kg rFVIIa compared with placebo (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.13\u20130.74), and bleeding\u2010related deaths were reduced from 12% (placebo) to 2% (600 \u03bcg/kg). A marked heterogeneity in the failure rate in all treatment groups was observed across participating centers. Adverse events, including overall thromboembolic events, were comparable between groups. Conclusion: Treatment with rFVIIa had no significant effect on the primary composite endpoint compared with placebo. Therefore, decision on the use of this hemostatic agent in acute variceal bleeding should be carefully considered, because results of this study do not support the routine use of rFVIIa in this setting. Adverse events were comparable across groups. (HEPATOLOGY 2008.)",

This study evaluates the outcomes of using rFVIIa as first-line therapy in patients with a severe TBI requiring emergent craniotomy that are coagulopathic. Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed patients admitted between 2003 and 2006 to a Level I trauma center with a severe TBI requiring an emergency craniotomy. Eighteen patients with coagulopathy that was corrected using rFVIIa were identified. Variables evaluated included age, injury severity score, head abbreviated injury score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, international normalized ratio, time to operation, operative procedure, thromboembolic events, and death. Results. The cohort consisted of 18 patients, predominantly male (55.6%) with a mean age of 80.5 years. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall. Coagulopathy was due to premorbid anticoagulants in 50% of the cohort. Time from admission to operation was 130 minutes. Coagulopathy reversal was complete in all 18 cases (100%). A high mortality rate (55.6%) was attributed to a high incidence of withdrawal of care (50%). The incidence of thromboembolic events was low (5.6%). Survivors, when compared with nonsurvivors, had a > 3-fold increase in postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale score for similar preoperative scores. A good functional outcome was achieved in 75% of survivors with a mean follow-up period of 4.2 months. Conclusions. The use of rFVIIa in the correction of coagulopathy in patients having sustained severe TBI requiring emergency craniotomy appears to be safe and effective even among the elderly. This allows a shorter transit time to craniotomy. Its effects on mortality and long-term neurological outcome requires further investigation prospectively.

OBJECTIVEWe report the results of our early experience with insertion of intraparenchymal intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors in these highly coagulopathic patients.

Methods: An OVID/MEDUNE and PubMed search (1997-June 2011) was performed to identify literature on the use of rFVIIa to reduce bleeding risk in patients with liver failure undergoing invasive procedures. Study Selection and Data Extraction: English-language data evaluating the efficacy of rFVIIa to reverse coagulopathies prior to invasive procedures in patients with liver disease were included. Data Synthesis: Following administration of rFVIIa, prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) response is within 30 minutes. Doses ranging from 20 to 120 \u03bcg/kg have been studied, with a reduction in PT seen in a dose-dependent manner. One study in patients with no bleeding administered 5, 20, and 80 \u03bcg/kg sequentially during a 24-day period. All doses provided reversal of prolonged PT within 10 minutes, and the duration was dose-dependent. In a study of 15 patients with fulminant liver failure, requiring intracranial pressure monitor placement, a rFVIIa dose of 40 \u03bcg/kg was compared to fresh frozen plasma. In patients who received rFVIIa, the PT and INR normalized, compared to none of the patients in the fresh frozen plasma group. Conclusions: Retrospective and prospective data demonstrate that rFVIIa effectively reverses elevated PT and INR, reducing the risk of bleeding and safely facilitating invasive procedures. Based on available data, a dose of 20-40 \u03bcg/kg 30 minutes prior to an invasive procedure should be considered in patients with acute or chronic liver failure at risk for bleeding complications. A major limitation of rFVIIa use is the high cost of therapy.
