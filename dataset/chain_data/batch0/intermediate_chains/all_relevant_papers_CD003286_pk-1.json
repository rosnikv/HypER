        "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that adolescents with type 1 diabetes can learn to become better problem solvers in diabetes self-care and thereby improve their metabolic control. METHODS Fifty-three adolescents aged 13 to 17 with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a 6-week problem-solving diabetes education program or to a control group (usual care). Al C levels were obtained as well as assessments of problem solving, frequency of behavior, level of responsibility, and 24-hour behavior recall at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS The experimental group participants showed significantly improved problem-solving test scores and Al C values from baseline to 6 months, changes not evident in the control group. At 6 months, the experimental group participants were doing blood glucose testing more often than those in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in problem-solving test scores or Al C values. CONCLUSIONS This 6-week intervention for adolescents with diabetes resulted in better problem-solving skills, more frequent blood glucose testing, and improved Al C values. The results suggest that a diabetes problem-solving program for adolescents can be effective in improving metabolic control.",
