            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the effectiveness of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg) and methylprednisolone acetate (60 mg) in Iraqi patients with primary and secondary frozen shoulder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total number of 135 (93 males and 42 females) patients with frozen shoulder, allocated at outpatient clinic of rheumatology in Al-Yarmook Teaching Hospital (Baghdad-Iraq) from January 2004 to December 2005, were enrolled in non-controlled clinical trial. The diagnosis of frozen shoulder was made using the guidelines for shoulder complaint issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. Intraarticular injections of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (46 males and 22 females) or 60 mg methylprednisolone acetate (47 males and 20 females) were given every 3 weeks (not more than 3 injections) by using posterior route.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth triamcinolone acetonide (81.8%) and methylprednisolone acetate (83.3%) were equally effective in primary frozen shoulder. Triamcinolone acetonide is significantly improved diabetic frozen shoulder in comparison to methylprednisolone acetate (69% versus 39%). Also patients on triamcinolone acetonide required less number of steroid injections and higher percent of severe cases were significantly improved by triamcinolone acetonide in comparison with methylprednisolone acetate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that triamcinolone acetonide is a good rescue for painful stiff shoulder particularly for resistant cases as with diabetes mellitus, and with long duration of illness. Also, its efficacy can be observed with less frequent injections.",

The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injection and pulse radiofrequency (PRF) applied to the suprascapular nerve in patients with shoulder pain. MethodsFifty patients with shoulder pain were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated into group 1 (intra-articular injection of corticosteroid) and group 2 (PRF to the suprascapular nerve). Outcome measures included a pain scale (visual analog scale; VAS), range of motion, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), the Short Form-36, Beck Depression Scale questionnaires, and paracetamol consumption. ResultsIn both groups, significant improvement was observed in all weeks in VAS, range of motion (active-passive), and SPADI subscores (P<0.05). Improvement was detected in most of the Short Form-36 scores at the end of the treatment in both groups (P<0.05), whereas no significant change was observed in Beck Depression Inventory score (P>0.05). When the groups were compared, a significant difference was found between the groups in favor of group 1 in terms of VAS at night in weeks 1, 4, and 12; VAS at rest in weeks 1 and 4; and VAS during movement in week 1 (P<0.05). There was also a significant difference in favor of group 1 observed in weeks 1, 4, and 12 in SPADI pain and total subscores (P<0.05). Paracetamol consumption was observed to be lower in group 1 (P<0.05). ConclusionsIntra-articular injection of corticosteroid and PRF applied to the suprascapular nerve are effective in the treatment of painful shoulder. When 2 treatments are compared, it may be concluded that intra-articular steroid injection was more effective especially in the first weeks regarding pain than the PRF.

The authors sought to obtain insight into the time-sensitive analgesic success and complications of this therapy. Patients and methods This study was a retrospective case series involving patients with unremitting shoulder pain that had lasted for at least 12 months. Patients were selected if they showed a reduction of at least 50% in pain intensity during the anesthetic phase after SSN block, no additional motor weakness of the shoulder, and pain relief lasting for less than 2 months after separate treatments of the SSN with depot corticosteroids and pulsed radiofrequency. Nine patients were referred to the Arnold Pain Management Center. Of these nine patients, six patients who had significant chronic shoulder pain unresponsive to oral medications and intra-articular injections and who were not considered surgical candidates were selected. These patients were treated with a single radiofrequency lesion of the SSN at 80\u00b0C for 60 seconds. The primary outcome was a reduction in pain intensity by 50%, as determined by the numeric rating scale, and duration of this effect. The secondary outcome was improvement in either the passive or the active range of motion (ROM). Patients were also monitored for adverse effects such as weakness or increased pain. Results The pooled mean numeric rating scale score before the procedure was 7.2 \u00b1 1.2; this fell to 3.0 \u00b1 0.9 at 5\u20137 weeks post procedure. The duration of pain relief ranged from 3 to 18 months, and all patients underwent at least one additional treatment. The change in baseline ROM improved from an average of 60\u00b0 \u00b1 28\u00b0 (flexion) and 58\u00b0 \u00b1 28\u00b0 (abduction) to 99\u00b0 \u00b1 46\u00b0 (flexion) and 107\u00b0 \u00b1 39\u00b0 (abduction). No adverse side effects were observed. Conclusion Continuous radiofrequency lesioning of the SSN seems to be an effective treatment for chronic shoulder pain. There can be improved ROM of the shoulder following this treatment. More formal, controlled studies are required to confirm these observations.",
