            "abstract": "We entered 60 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine whether colchicine is therapeutically effective. Thirty patients had early disease (Stages 1 and 2), and 30 had advanced disease (Stages 3 and 4). Fifteen patients with early disease and 15 with advanced disease received colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily), and the remainder received placebo. Patients were studied about every two months; those remaining in the blind phase at two years underwent repeat liver biopsy and were then placed on open-label colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily). With a few exceptions, the results in patients with early disease were similar to those in patients with advanced disease; hence, data on patients in all stages were combined in the main analysis. During the two-year study period the colchicine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo-treated patients, had improvement in levels of serum albumin, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and aminotransferases. However, there was no such improvement in the severity of symptoms or physical findings; moreover, there was no significant difference in the histologic changes noted at liver biopsy in the two treatment groups. At four years after entry, the cumulative mortality from liver disease was 21 percent in patients given colchicine and 47 percent in those given placebo (P = 0.05). The only side effect of colchicine was diarrhea, noted in three patients. The consistent and significant improvement in a number of markers of liver disease and the apparent decreased mortality from liver disease suggest that colchicine may provide some long-term clinical benefit in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the failure of colchicine to reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis leaves uncertain the effect of the drug on the longterm outcome of this disease.",

To evaluate the use of colchicine (1 mg per day, five days per week) in the treatment of hepatic cirrhosis, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 patients were followed for up to 14 years. Forty-five patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 41 had posthepatitic cirrhosis, and the remaining 14 had cirrhosis with various other causes. Histologic studies were available for 92 percent of patients. Seventy-three patients were in Child-Turcotte class A, 26 were in class B, and one was in class C. Fifty-four patients received colchicine, and 46 received placebo. The overall survival in the colchicine group was markedly better than in the placebo group (median survival, 11 and 3.5 years, respectively; P less than 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 75 percent in the colchicine group and 34 percent in the placebo group; the corresponding 10-year survival rates were 56 percent and 20 percent. Among the 30 patients treated with colchicine who underwent repeated liver biopsies, histologic improvement was seen in 9; the liver appeared normal in 2, and 7 had minimal portal fibrosis. No histologic improvement was observed in the 14 members of the placebo group who had two or more biopsies. Few side effects were observed in either group.",

            "abstract": "There is preliminary evidence that colchicine, an inhibitor of collagen synthesis, may be beneficial in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. To evaluate the use of colchicine (1 mg per day, five days per week) in the treatment of hepatic cirrhosis, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 patients were followed for up to 14 years. Forty-five patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 41 had posthepatitic cirrhosis, and the remaining 14 had cirrhosis with various other causes. Histologic studies were available for 92 percent of patients. Seventy-three patients were in Child-Turcotte class A, 26 were in class B, and one was in class C. Fifty-four patients received colchicine, and 46 received placebo. The overall survival in the colchicine group was markedly better than in the placebo group (median survival, 11 and 3.5 years, respectively; P less than 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 75 percent in the colchicine group and 34 percent in the placebo group; the corresponding 10-year survival rates were 56 percent and 20 percent. Among the 30 patients treated with colchicine who underwent repeated liver biopsies, histologic improvement was seen in 9; the liver appeared normal in 2, and 7 had minimal portal fibrosis. No histologic improvement was observed in the 14 members of the placebo group who had two or more biopsies. Few side effects were observed in either group.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe most troublesome complication of acute pericarditis is recurrent episodes of pericardial inflammation, occurring in 15% to 32% of cases. The cause of the recurrence is usually unknown, although in some cases it may be traced to viral infection or may be a consequence of coronary artery bypass grafting. The optimal method for prevention has not been fully established; accepted modalities include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and pericardiectomy.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nBased on the proven efficacy of colchicine therapy for familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent polyserositis), several small studies have used colchicine successfully to prevent recurrence of acute pericarditis after failure of conventional treatment. Recently, we reported the results from the largest multicenter international study on 51 patients who were treated with colchicine to prevent further relapses and who were followed up for < or = 10 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn light of new trial data that have accumulated in the past decade, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of colchicine for the prevention of recurrent episodes of pericarditis. Clinical and personal experience shows that colchicine may be an extremely promising adjunct to conventional treatment and may ultimately serve as the initial mode of treatment, especially in idiopathic cases.",

The pericarditis was idiopathic in 33 patients and secondary in 18. Recurrences of pericarditis did not respond to conventional therapy consisting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis, or some combination thereof and could only be controlled after the initiation of colchicine treatment. The authors concluded that colchicine was effective and safe for the long-term prevention of recurrent pericarditis, especially in idiopathic cases.\n\nColchicine therapy has been shown to be an effective method for eliminating attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent and self-limited attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of peritoneum, synovium, and pleura.2 Pericardial involvement is a rare but well-known feature of the disease.2 Tauber et al3 reported 2 patients who had recurrent pericarditis \u2026",

            "abstract": "Idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) is suspected to be an autoimmune phenomenon. We studied 46 consecutive patients. We looked for: 1) the occurrence of new diagnoses of autoimmune diseases during our follow up; 2) HLA typing; and 3) the presence of the most frequent mutations linked to familial Mediterranean fever (FMF gene or MEFV). HLA typing was done in 21 patients at loci B, DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1. MEFV gene was looked in 23 patients using specific primers. During the follow-up we made a new diagnosis of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome in four patients (8.7%) and of rheumatoid arthritis in one patient (2.2%). HLA B14, DRB1*01 and DQB1*0202 were significantly more prevalent, but we did not find a typical HLA typing. MEFV gene was searched: exon 10 was checked by sequence and the E148Q mutation by restriction site analysis. No mutations were found. In conclusion, the prevalence of definite immunorheumatological diseases and the absence of the mutations linked to FMF reinforce the notion that idiopathic acute recurrent pericarditis is an autoimmune condition.",

All patients received prolonged courses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; generally we do not start a corticosteroid in recurrent acute pericarditis, but if a steroid had already been started, we planned a very slow tapering; if necessary azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, and other immunosuppressive drugs were used; 44 patients (27 males, 61.4%) were treated also with colchicine and 14 patients (7 males, 50%) were not given this drug.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter starting our protocol recurrences dropped from 0.48 to 0.03 attacks/patient/month (p < 0.00001) within 12 months and remained at the same level till the end of the follow-up (mean 8.1 years) in the whole cohort. In the 44 patients treated with colchicine recurrences dropped from 0.54 to 0.03 attacks/patient/month (p < 0.00001) within 12 months, and in 14 patients not given colchicine recurrences decreased from 0.31 to 0.06 attacks/patient/month (p = 0.002).

            "abstract": "Colchicine has been effectively used in the treatment of several inflammatory conditions, such as gouty attacks, serositis related to familial Mediterranean fever, Beh\u00e7et syndrome, and more recently also in acute and recurrent pericarditis. Growing evidence has shown that the drug may be useful to treat an acute attack and may be a way to cope with the prevention of pericarditis in acute and recurrent cases and after cardiac surgery. Nevertheless, clinicians are often sceptical about the efficacy of the drug, and concerns have risen on possible side effects and tolerability. In this review, we analyse current evidence to support the use of the drug, as well as possible harms and risks related to drug interactions, reaching the conclusion that colchicine is safe and useful in recurrent pericarditis, if specific precautions are followed, although less evidence supports its use for the treatment of acute pericarditis, where colchicine remains optional and there is a need for further multicentre confirmatory studies. This paper also reviews specific dosing and precautions for the clinical use.",

Background Recurrent pericarditis prevention is a major management goal that may reduce morbidity and management costs. Although empiric anti-inflammatory therapy is considered the mainstay of treatment, no specific drug has been proven to be efficacious for prevention but colchicine. Methods Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included provided they focused on the pharmacologic primary or secondary prevention of pericarditis. We performed a meta-analysis including studies primary outcome, adverse events, and drug withdrawal. Results From the initial sample of 127 citations, five controlled clinical trials were finally included (795 patients): three studies were double-blind randomised controlled trials, and two studies were open-label randomised controlled trials. Trials followed patients for a mean of 13\u2005months. Meta-analytic pooling showed that colchicine use was associated with a reduced risk of pericarditis during follow-up (RR=0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, p for effect <0.001, p for heterogeneity = 0.95, I2=0%) either for primary or secondary prevention without a significant higher risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR=1.22, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.10, p for effect 0.48, p for heterogeneity = 0.44, I2=0%), but more cases of drug withdrawals (RR=1.85, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.29, p for effect 0.04, p for heterogeneity = 0.42, I2=0%).

However, conclusive data are lacking regarding the use of colchicine during a first attack of acute pericarditis and in the prevention of recurrent symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a multicenter, double-blind trial, eligible adults with acute pericarditis were randomly assigned to receive either colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily for 3 months for patients weighing >70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing \u226470 kg) or placebo in addition to conventional antiinflammatory therapy with aspirin or ibuprofen. The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 240 patients were enrolled, and 120 were randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. The primary outcome occurred in 20 patients (16.7%) in the colchicine group and 45 patients (37.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction in the colchicine group, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72; number needed to treat, 4; P<0.001). Colchicine reduced the rate of symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40.0%, P=0.001), the number of recurrences per patient (0.21 vs. 0.52, P=0.001), and the hospitalization rate (5.0% vs. 14.2%, P=0.02).

However, conclusive data are lacking regarding the use of colchicine during a first attack of acute pericarditis and in the prevention of recurrent symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a multicenter, double-blind trial, eligible adults with acute pericarditis were randomly assigned to receive either colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily for 3 months for patients weighing >70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing \u226470 kg) or placebo in addition to conventional antiinflammatory therapy with aspirin or ibuprofen. The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 240 patients were enrolled, and 120 were randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. The primary outcome occurred in 20 patients (16.7%) in the colchicine group and 45 patients (37.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction in the colchicine group, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72; number needed to treat, 4; P<0.001). Colchicine reduced the rate of symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40.0%, P=0.001), the number of recurrences per patient (0.21 vs. 0.52, P=0.001), and the hospitalization rate (5.0% vs. 14.2%, P=0.02). Colchicine also improved the remission rate at 1 week (85.0% vs. 58.3%, P<0.001). Overall adverse effects and rates of study-drug discontinuation were similar in the two study groups.

However, conclusive data are lacking regarding the use of colchicine during a first attack of acute pericarditis and in the prevention of recurrent symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a multicenter, double-blind trial, eligible adults with acute pericarditis were randomly assigned to receive either colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily for 3 months for patients weighing >70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing \u226470 kg) or placebo in addition to conventional antiinflammatory therapy with aspirin or ibuprofen. The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 240 patients were enrolled, and 120 were randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. The primary outcome occurred in 20 patients (16.7%) in the colchicine group and 45 patients (37.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction in the colchicine group, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72; number needed to treat, 4; P<0.001). Colchicine reduced the rate of symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40.0%, P=0.001), the number of recurrences per patient (0.21 vs. 0.52, P=0.001), and the hospitalization rate (5.0% vs. 14.2%, P=0.02). Colchicine also improved the remission rate at 1 week (85.0% vs. 58.3%, P<0.001). Overall adverse effects and rates of study-drug discontinuation were similar in the two study groups.

The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 240 patients were enrolled, and 120 were randomly assigned to each of the two study groups.

Postoperative use of colchicine prevented these complications in a single trial.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the efficacy and safety of perioperative use of oral colchicine in reducing postpericardiotomy syndrome, postoperative AF, and postoperative pericardial or pleural effusions.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nInvestigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial among 360 consecutive candidates for cardiac surgery enrolled in 11 Italian centers between March 2012 and March 2014. At enrollment, mean age of the trial participants was 67.5 years (SD, 10.6 years), 69% were men, and 36% had planned valvular surgery. Main exclusion criteria were absence of sinus rhythm at enrollment, cardiac transplantation, and contraindications to colchicine.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomized to receive placebo (n=180) or colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily in patients \u226570 kg or 0.5 mg once daily in patients <70 kg; n=180) starting between 48 and 72 hours before surgery and continued for 1 month after surgery.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nOccurrence of postpericardiotomy syndrome within 3 months; main secondary study end points were postoperative AF and pericardial or pleural effusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point of postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 35 patients (19.4%) assigned to colchicine and in 53 (29.4%) assigned to placebo (absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.1%-18.7%; number needed to treat\u2009=\u200910). There were no significant differences between the colchicine and placebo groups for the secondary end points of postoperative AF (colchicine, 61 patients [33.9%]; placebo, 75 patients [41.7%]; absolute difference, 7.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to 17.6%) or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion (colchicine, 103 patients [57.2%]; placebo, 106 patients [58.9%]; absolute difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -8.5% to 11.7%), although there was a reduction in postoperative AF in the prespecified on-treatment analysis (placebo, 61/148 patients [41.2%]; colchicine, 38/141 patients [27.0%]; absolute difference, 14.2%; 95% CI, 3.3%-24.7%). Adverse events occurred in 21 patients (11.7%) in the placebo group vs 36 (20.0%) in the colchicine group (absolute difference, 8.3%; 95% CI; 0.76%-15.9%; number needed to harm\u2009=\u200912), but discontinuation rates were similar. No serious adverse events were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong patients undergoing cardiac surgery, perioperative use of colchicine compared with placebo reduced the incidence of postpericardiotomy syndrome but not of postoperative AF or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion. The increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects reduced the potential benefits of colchicine in this setting.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01552187.",

At enrollment, mean age of the trial participants was 67.5 years (SD, 10.6 years), 69% were men, and 36% had planned valvular surgery. Main exclusion criteria were absence of sinus rhythm at enrollment, cardiac transplantation, and contraindications to colchicine.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomized to receive placebo (n=180) or colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily in patients \u226570 kg or 0.5 mg once daily in patients <70 kg; n=180) starting between 48 and 72 hours before surgery and continued for 1 month after surgery.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nOccurrence of postpericardiotomy syndrome within 3 months; main secondary study end points were postoperative AF and pericardial or pleural effusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe primary end point of postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 35 patients (19.4%) assigned to colchicine and in 53 (29.4%) assigned to placebo (absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.1%-18.7%; number needed to treat\u2009=\u200910).
