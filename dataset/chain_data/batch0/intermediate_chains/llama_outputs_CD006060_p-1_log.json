            "abstract": "The stringent targets set for HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes are currently achieved by fewer than half the patients in the United States. Failure to manage hyperglycaemia in the early stages of disease results in progressive loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function, which ultimately necessitates the initiation of insulin therapy. At this point, choices have to be made on whether to continue oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy and, if so, with which agent(s). Historically, sulfonylureas have been the mainstay of oral anti\u2010diabetic drug therapy; however, their long\u2010term efficacy in patients with depleted \u03b2\u2010cell capacity is doubtful, and other classes of oral anti\u2010diabetic drugs, notably the insulin sensitizers, may prove more reliable. These agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones) appear to provide various benefits over and above sustained glycaemic control, which may variably include reduced loss of \u03b2\u2010cell function as well as improvements to cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Metformin also limits weight gain associated with insulin therapy. This manuscript presents the case that when insulin therapy is initiated it should be tailored to individual needs through combination with one or more insulin sensitizers rather than a secretagogue.

This analysis was part of a 24\u2010week trial, in which 964 insulin\u2010naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral agents (including metformin) were randomized to insulin glargine or detemir. Secretagogues were stopped or maintained at the site\u2010investigators' discretion. During the study, 57.6% of patients continued their secretagogue treatment. Compared with patients stopping secretagogues, those who continued experienced significantly more hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower: 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 versus 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 U/kg/day (p < 0.001). The difference between groups in mean HbA1c reduction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic patients starting basal insulin analogue therapy, continuing both metformin and secretagogues results in more hypoglycaemia and weight gain and lower insulin doses than only maintaining metformin.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultralong duration of action, and a rapid-acting insulin in a single injection. This trial compared IDegAsp with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with once- or twice-daily (OD or BID) pre- or self-mixed insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 26-week, randomized, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target trial, participants (mean age 58.7 years, duration of diabetes 13 years, BMI 29.3 kg/m2, and HbA1c 8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) were exposed (1:1) to BID injections of IDegAsp (n = 224) or BIAsp 30 (n = 222), administered with breakfast and the main evening meal and dose titrated to a self-measured premeal plasma glucose (PG) target of 4.0\u20135.0 mmol/L. RESULTS After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c was 7.1% (54 mmol/mol) for both groups, with IDegAsp achieving the prespecified noninferiority margin for mean change in HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] \u20130.03% points [95% CI \u20130.18 to 0.13]). Treatment with IDegAsp was superior in lowering fasting PG (ETD \u20131.14 mmol/L [95% CI \u20131.53 to \u20130.76], P < 0.001) and had a significantly lower final mean daily insulin dose (estimated rate ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.83\u20130.96], P = 0.002). Fewer confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemia episodes were reported for IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30. CONCLUSIONS IDegAsp BID effectively improves HbA1c and fasting PG levels with fewer hypoglycemia episodes versus BIAsp 30 in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes previously treated with once- or twice-daily pre- or self-mixed insulin.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultralong duration of action, and a rapid-acting insulin in a single injection. This trial compared IDegAsp with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with once- or twice-daily (OD or BID) pre- or self-mixed insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 26-week, randomized, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target trial, participants (mean age 58.7 years, duration of diabetes 13 years, BMI 29.3 kg/m2, and HbA1c 8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) were exposed (1:1) to BID injections of IDegAsp (n = 224) or BIAsp 30 (n = 222), administered with breakfast and the main evening meal and dose titrated to a self-measured premeal plasma glucose (PG) target of 4.0\u20135.0 mmol/L. RESULTS After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c was 7.1% (54 mmol/mol) for both groups, with IDegAsp achieving the prespecified noninferiority margin for mean change in HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] \u20130.03% points [95% CI \u20130.18 to 0.13]). Treatment with IDegAsp was superior in lowering fasting PG (ETD \u20131.14 mmol/L [95% CI \u20131.53 to \u20130.76], P < 0.001) and had a significantly lower final mean daily insulin dose (estimated rate ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.83\u20130.96], P = 0.002). Fewer confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemia episodes were reported for IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30. CONCLUSIONS IDegAsp BID effectively improves HbA1c and fasting PG levels with fewer hypoglycemia episodes versus BIAsp 30 in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes previously treated with once- or twice-daily pre- or self-mixed insulin.",

            "abstract": "Insulin degludec/aspart (IDegAsp) and insulin glargine U300 (IGlarU300) have recently emerged as popular new\u2010generation insulin analogues. The aim of this real\u2010life study was to investigate the patient profiles in which IGlarU300 and IDegAsp were preferred and the insulin combinations after which each of them were mostly used and also to analyse the effect of these two insulin analogues on blood glucose regulation and hypoglycaemia.",
