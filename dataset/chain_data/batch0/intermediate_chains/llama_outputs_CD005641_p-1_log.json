Methods: Between September 2004 and March 2008, 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic CBD exploration for CBD stones were randomized to choledochotomy closure over either a biliary stent or a T-tube after CBD clearance. Patients at high risk for surgery and unremitting cholangitis requiring preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage were excluded. Results: There were 29 and 31 patients in the T-tube and stenting groups, respectively. The 2 groups were comparable with respect to their demographic profile and disease characteristics. Patients in the stent group had a significantly shorter operative time and postoperative stay with an earlier return to normal activity (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Choledochotomy closure over a stent results in a shorter postoperative stay and an earlier return to normal activity compared with closure over a T-tube without any increase in morbidity.",

If laparoscopic exploration is performed and biliary decompression is needed after stone removal, the placement of a laparoscopic transpapillary stent shows promising results in avoiding T-tube\u2013related complications. Methods: Between January 2007 and May 2012, a series of 48 patients who underwent biliary decompression after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) to treat choledocholithiasis was retrospectively analyzed. The results in patients with transpapillary stent placement (TS=35) were compared with those who had an external biliary drainage (EBD=13). Results: LCBDE and TS placement was achieved either by a choledochotomy or through the cystic duct. There was no mortality in our series. Patients with an external biliary drainage (EBD) had more surgery-related complications (P<.0001) and a longer hospital stay (P=.03). Postoperative ERCP to remove the TS was successful in all cases. Conclusion: Laparoscopic TS is a safe method in the treatment of selected patients with CBD stones that can be achieved without having to perform a choledochotomy. Because of the lower morbidity and the shorter hospital stay compared with EBD, it should be considered as a first approach whenever biliary decompression is needed after LCBDE.",
