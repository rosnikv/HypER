            "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS\nDespite a proposed role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, antioxidant approaches have not been investigated sufficiently in the therapy of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our aim was to determine whether vitamin E plus C therapy is effective in normalization of liver enzymes compared to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in patients with fatty liver disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was an open-labeled, prospective, randomized study enrolling patients with histologically proven fatty liver disease who had chronically elevated alanine aminotransferase, despite a three-month reducing diet. Patients consuming alcohol (more than 20 g/day) were excluded. The patients were randomly prescribed either oral vitamin E (600 IU/day) plus vitamin C (500 mg/day) or ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg/day). Patients were randomized as two groups to receive vitamin E plus vitamin C combination (28 patients, 10 F) or ursodeoxycholic acid treatment (29 patients, 13 F).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant change in body mass index before and after the treatment in both groups. At the end of six months of therapy, serum aspartate aminotransferase and aminotransferase levels significantly decreased in both treatment options. Vitamin E and C combination was more efficacious on serum aminotransferase levels than ursodeoxycholic acid, but the difference was not significant. Alanine aminotransferase decreased to normal levels in 17 of 27 (63%) and in 16 of 29 patients (55%), respectively, in the two groups. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid, but no change was obtained in the vitamin-treated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVitamin E plus C combination treatment is a safe, inexpensive and effective treatment option in patients with fatty liver disease, with results comparable to those obtained with ursodeoxycholic acid. Since more effective new therapeutic options are lacking, patients with fatty liver disease should be encouraged to take vitamin E and C supplements, which are safe and affordable.",

The present study assesses the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and dietary supplement interventions for NAFLD. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) both in adults and in children. Results: Fifteen (2 pediatric patients and 13 adults) RCTs met the inclusion criteria. A significant effect on normalization of alanine transaminase was found in patients treated with metformin compared with vitamin E, and in those treated with high-dose (3 g) carnitine vs diet. In contrast, there was no difference in patients treated with pioglitazone combined with vitamin E versus vitamin E alone, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) combined with vitamin E or alone versus placebo, or UDCA versus combination of vitamin E and vitamin C, and in patients treated with vitamin E, probucol, N-acetylcysteine, low doses of carnitine, or Yo Jyo Shi Ko compared with placebo. Aspartate aminotransferase normalization was significantly higher in those treated with UDCA combined with vitamin E versus UDCA alone or placebo, and in those treated with metformin. Small number of subjects, high drop-out rates, and numerous interventions in 1 study limit the value of many studies. Only 7 RCTs analyzed biopsy specimens, but most of them have significant methodological limitations. Pioglitazone had reduced liver necrosis and inflammation in 1 large study.

Aspartate aminotransferase normalization was significantly higher in those treated with UDCA combined with vitamin E versus UDCA alone or placebo, and in those treated with metformin. Small number of subjects, high drop-out rates, and numerous interventions in 1 study limit the value of many studies. Only 7 RCTs analyzed biopsy specimens, but most of them have significant methodological limitations. Pioglitazone had reduced liver necrosis and inflammation in 1 large study. Conclusions: Limited data do not allow one to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy of various treatments for NAFLD.",

The beneficial effect of spironolactone in a mouse model with diabetes and NAFLD has recently been reported. The main aim was assessment of the effect of spironolactone on serum metabolic parameters and insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD. Methods: This study includes preliminary results of a single-centre randomised controlled trial of treatment with vitamin E (group 1, 10 patients) versus spironolactone plus vitamin E (group 2, 10 patients) in biopsy-proven NAFLD. Serum transaminases, lipids, potassium, sodium, glucose and insulin were measured, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated before and 8 weeks after baseline assessment. Results: Insulin was decreased within group 2 (15.3 \u00b1 2.7 at baseline vs. 10.3 \u00b1 5.0 at week 8, p = 0.013). Although no difference in glucose was observed, HOMA-IR significantly decreased (4.4 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 0.5, respectively, p = 0.047). QUICKI was increased, but not statistically significantly.

            "abstract": "Epidemiological studies support the notion that arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events contributing significantly to systolic hypertension, impaired ventricular-arterial coupling and diastolic dysfunction, impairment in myocardial oxygen supply and demand, and progression of kidney disease. Although arterial stiffness is associated with aging, it is accelerated in the presence of obesity and diabetes. The prevalence of arterial stiffness parallels the increase of obesity that is occurring in epidemic proportions and is partly driven by a sedentary life style and consumption of a high fructose, high salt, and high fat western diet. Although the underlying mechanisms and mediators of arterial stiffness are not well understood, accumulating evidence supports the role of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. The local tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the vascular tissue and immune cells and perivascular adipose tissue is recognized as an important element involved in endothelial dysfunction which contributes significantly to arterial stiffness. Activation of vascular RAAS is seen in humans and animal models of obesity and diabetes, and associated with enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation in the vascular tissue. The cross talk between angiotensin and aldosterone underscores the importance of mineralocorticoid receptors in modulation of insulin resistance, decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness. In addition, both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in this local tissue activation of RAAS. In this review we will attempt to present a unifying mechanism of how environmental and immunological factors are involved in this local tissue RAAS activation, and the role of this process in the development of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness and targeting tissue RAAS activation.",

            "abstract": "The concept of a \u201clocal\u201d renin angiotensin system (RAS) can mean different things to different people. Its main purpose is to differentiate the \u201clocal\u201d RAS operating in tissues from the classical \u201ccirculating\u201d RAS, but it is difficult to differentiate between the two systems because of their extensive overlap. The circulating RAS comprises kidney-derived renin acting on liver-derived angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin (Ang) I that is converted to Ang II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). However, tissues are the main site of production of angiotensin peptides by the circulating RAS, whereby plasma-derived renin acts on plasma-derived angiotensinogen to generate Ang I, which is converted to Ang II by endothelial ACE (1\u20134). \n \nLocal RAS refers to tissue-based mechanisms of Ang peptide formation that operate separately from the circulating RAS. Although many different concepts of local RAS have been described, a key feature is the local synthesis of RAS components including angiotensinogen and enzymes such as renin that cleave angiotensinogen to produce Ang peptides independently of the circulating RAS. ACE and Ang II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors are invariably locally synthesized, but these are also components of the circulating RAS. Many other potential components of local RAS have been described that may contribute to tissue-specific mechanisms of Ang peptide formation, and that may either participate in disease processes or contribute to mechanisms that protect from tissue injury. These include the (pro)renin receptor (5), renin-independent mechanisms of Ang peptide generation from Ang- (1-12) (6), intracellular (or intracrine) RAS that may contribute to cardiovascular disease (7, 8), and AT2 receptors (7) and the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway (6\u20138) that may mediate therapeutic benefit in cardiovascular disease. In addition, novel Ang peptides with novel pharmacology, including Ang IV, Ang A, alamandine, and angioprotectin (6, 8), have the potential to contribute to disease or to protective mechanisms. Moreover, the brain RAS, including the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor and the Ang IV/insulin regulated aminopeptidase pathways may play a role in Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases (9). Local production of aldosterone may have a pathogenic role (7, 10), ACE, AT2 receptors, Ang-(1-7) and acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro may have a role in hematopoiesis (11), and the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway may contribute to fetal programing, reproduction, and cancer (6, 12). \n \nThis short opinion piece discusses the potential clinical relevance of local RAS. The challenge in demonstrating the independence of local from circulating RAS, and the potential interaction of ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) therapies with local RAS are discussed. Attempts to define local RAS that are independent of the circulating RAS have been primarily based on animal models and the clinical relevance of local RAS is uncertain. However, this area of research continues to evolve, and today\u2019s opinions may change as we gain better understanding of how these novel components and mechanisms impact on clinical medicine.",

At the core of such complex phenotype is the presence of unique vascular abnormalities: the renal arterioles do not branch or elongate properly and they have disorganized, concentric hypertrophy. This lesion has been puzzling because it is often found in hypertensive individuals whereas mutant or pharmacologically inhibited animals are hypotensive. Remarkably, when renin cells are ablated with diphtheria toxin, the vascular hypertrophy does not occur, suggesting that renin cells per se may contribute to the vascular disease. To test this hypothesis, on a Ren1c\u2212/\u2212 background, we generated mutant mice with reporter expression (Ren1c\u2212/\u2212;Ren1c-Cre;R26R.mTmG and Ren1c\u2212/\u2212;Ren1c-Cre;R26R.LacZ) to trace the fate of reninnull cells. To assess whether reninnull cells maintain their renin promoter active, we used Ren1c\u2212/\u2212;Ren1c-YFP mice that transcribe YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) directed by the renin promoter. We also followed the expression of Akr1b7 and miR-330-5p, markers of cells programmed for the renin phenotype. Contrary to what we expected, reninnull cells did not die or disappear. Instead, they survived, increased in number along the renal arterial tree, and maintained an active molecular memory of the myoepitheliod renin phenotype.

Here, we assessed the efficacy of a novel AGT siRNA in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were treated with vehicle, siRNA (10 mg/kg fortnightly; subcutaneous), valsartan (31 mg/kg per day; oral), captopril (100 mg/kg per day; oral), valsartan+siRNA, or captopril+valsartan for 4 weeks (all groups, n=8). Mean arterial pressure (recorded via radiotelemetry) was lowered the most by valsartan+siRNA (\u221268\u00b14 mm\u2009Hg), followed by captopril+valsartan (\u221254\u00b14 mm\u2009Hg), captopril (\u221223\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg), siRNA (\u221214\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg), and valsartan (\u221210\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg). siRNA and captopril monotherapies improved cardiac hypertrophy equally, but less than the dual therapies, which also lowered NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). Glomerular filtration rate, urinary NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), and albuminuria were unaffected by treatment. siRNA lowered circulating AGT by 97.9\u00b11.0%, and by 99.8\u00b10.1% in combination with valsartan. Although siRNA greatly reduced renal Ang (angiotensin) I, only valsartan+siRNA suppressed circulating and renal Ang II. This coincided with decreased renal sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3 and phosphorylated sodium chloride cotransporter abundances. Renin and plasma K+ increased with every treatment, but especially during valsartan+siRNA; no effects on aldosterone were observed. Collectively, these data indicate that Ang II elimination requires >99% suppression of circulating AGT. Maximal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, achieved by valsartan+siRNA, yielded the greatest reduction in blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas AGT lowering alone was as effective as conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Given its stable and sustained efficacy, lasting weeks, RNA interference may offer a unique approach to improving therapy adherence and treating hypertension.",

            "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting hepatic angiotensinogen (Agt) may provide long-lasting antihypertensive effects, but the optimal approach remains unclear. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a novel AGT siRNA in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were treated with vehicle, siRNA (10 mg/kg fortnightly; subcutaneous), valsartan (31 mg/kg per day; oral), captopril (100 mg/kg per day; oral), valsartan+siRNA, or captopril+valsartan for 4 weeks (all groups, n=8). Mean arterial pressure (recorded via radiotelemetry) was lowered the most by valsartan+siRNA (\u221268\u00b14 mm\u2009Hg), followed by captopril+valsartan (\u221254\u00b14 mm\u2009Hg), captopril (\u221223\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg), siRNA (\u221214\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg), and valsartan (\u221210\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg). siRNA and captopril monotherapies improved cardiac hypertrophy equally, but less than the dual therapies, which also lowered NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). Glomerular filtration rate, urinary NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), and albuminuria were unaffected by treatment. siRNA lowered circulating AGT by 97.9\u00b11.0%, and by 99.8\u00b10.1% in combination with valsartan. Although siRNA greatly reduced renal Ang (angiotensin) I, only valsartan+siRNA suppressed circulating and renal Ang II. This coincided with decreased renal sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3 and phosphorylated sodium chloride cotransporter abundances. Renin and plasma K+ increased with every treatment, but especially during valsartan+siRNA; no effects on aldosterone were observed. Collectively, these data indicate that Ang II elimination requires >99% suppression of circulating AGT. Maximal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, achieved by valsartan+siRNA, yielded the greatest reduction in blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas AGT lowering alone was as effective as conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Given its stable and sustained efficacy, lasting weeks, RNA interference may offer a unique approach to improving therapy adherence and treating hypertension.",

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting liver angiotensinogen (AGT) lowers blood pressure, but its effectiveness in hypertensive chronic kidney disease is unknown. Considering that the kidney may generate its own AGT, we assessed the effectiveness of liver-targeted AGT siRNA in the 5/6th Nx (5/6th nephrectomy) rat\u2014a hypertensive chronic kidney disease model. Five weeks after 5/6th Nx (baseline), rats were subjected to vehicle, AGT siRNA, AGT siRNA+losartan, losartan, or losartan+captopril. Baseline mean arterial pressure was 160\u00b16 mm\u2009Hg. Over the course of 4 weeks, mean arterial pressure increased further by \u224815 mm\u2009Hg during vehicle treatment. This rise was prevented by AGT siRNA. Losartan reduced mean arterial pressure by 37\u00b16 mm\u2009Hg and increased plasma Ang (angiotensin) II. Both AGT siRNA and captopril suppressed these effects of losartan, suggesting that its blood pressure\u2013lowering effect relied on stimulation of vasodilator Ang II type 2 receptors by high Ang II levels. Proteinuria and cardiac hypertrophy increased with vehicle, and these increases were comparably abrogated by all treatments. No intervention improved glomerular filtration rate, while siRNA and losartan equally diminished glomerulosclerosis. AGT siRNA\u00b1losartan reduced plasma AGT by >95%, and this was accompanied by almost complete elimination of Ang II in kidney and heart, without decreasing renal AGT mRNA. Multiple linear regression confirmed both mean arterial pressure and renal Ang II as independent determinants of proteinuria. In conclusion, AGT siRNA exerts renoprotection in the 5/6th Nx model in a blood pressure\u2013independent manner. This relies on the suppression of renal Ang II formation from liver-derived AGT. Consequently, AGT siRNA may prove beneficial in human chronic kidney disease.",

            "abstract": "Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition exerts cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, often on top of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. We investigated this in diabetic hypertensive (mREN2)27 rats. Methods: Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin and treated with vehicle, the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, or their combination. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by telemetry. Results: Diabetes resulted in albuminuria, accompanied by glomerulosclerosis, without a change in glomerular filtration rate. Empagliflozin did not lower BP, while valsartan did, and when combined the BP drop was largest. Only dual blockade reduced cardiac hypertrophy and prevented left ventricular dilatation. Valsartan, but not empagliflozin, increased renin, and the largest renin rise occurred during dual blockade, resulting in plasma angiotensin II [but not angiotensin-(1\u20137)] upregulation. In contrast, in the kidney, valsartan lowered angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1\u20137), and empagliflozin did not alter this. Although both valsartan and empagliflozin alone tended to diminish albuminuria, the reduction was significant only when both drugs were combined. This was accompanied by reduced glomerulosclerosis, no change in glomerular filtration rate, and a favorable expression pattern of fibrosis and inflammatory markers (including SGLT2) in the kidney. Conclusion: RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition display synergistic beneficial effects on BP, kidney injury and cardiac hypertrophy in a rat with hypertension and diabetes. The synergy does not involve upregulation of angiotensin-(1\u20137), but may relate to direct RAS-independent effects of empagliflozin in the heart and kidney.",
