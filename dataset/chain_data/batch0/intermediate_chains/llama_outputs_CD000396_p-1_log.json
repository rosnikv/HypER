A 6-week, active-comparator- and placebo-controlled period (part I) was followed by a 46-week active-comparator-controlled period (part II). The primary outcome measures (on 100-mm visual analog scales) were patient's assessment of spine pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 387 patients randomized to receive treatment, 301 (77.8%) completed part I and 284 (75.9%) completed part II. Compared with placebo over 6 weeks, those receiving 90 mg etoricoxib, 120 mg etoricoxib, and naproxen demonstrated significantly (P < 0.001) greater improvement in all primary end points; treatment effects (expressed as the difference in least squares mean change versus placebo) were 21-29 mm for spine pain, 18-25 mm for disease activity, and 11-15 mm for function. Compared with patients receiving naproxen, significantly greater improvement in all primary end points was demonstrated in the combined group receiving either 90 mg etoricoxib or 120 mg etoricoxib over 6 weeks, in each individual etoricoxib treatment group over 6 weeks, and in the combined etoricoxib group over 1 year (all P < 0.05); results for secondary and exploratory end points were generally consistent with those from the primary analysis. Among all groups, there were no significant differences in the incidence of overall clinical, drug-related, or serious adverse experiences (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs. Safety observations during part II were generally consistent with those in part I.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEtoricoxib at doses of 90 mg and 120 mg demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo over 6 weeks, and compared with naproxen over 1 year. These study results demonstrate that etoricoxib is generally safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious for the treatment of AS.",

A 6-week, active-comparator- and placebo-controlled period (part I) was followed by a 46-week active-comparator-controlled period (part II). The primary outcome measures (on 100-mm visual analog scales) were patient's assessment of spine pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 387 patients randomized to receive treatment, 301 (77.8%) completed part I and 284 (75.9%) completed part II. Compared with placebo over 6 weeks, those receiving 90 mg etoricoxib, 120 mg etoricoxib, and naproxen demonstrated significantly (P < 0.001) greater improvement in all primary end points; treatment effects (expressed as the difference in least squares mean change versus placebo) were 21-29 mm for spine pain, 18-25 mm for disease activity, and 11-15 mm for function. Compared with patients receiving naproxen, significantly greater improvement in all primary end points was demonstrated in the combined group receiving either 90 mg etoricoxib or 120 mg etoricoxib over 6 weeks, in each individual etoricoxib treatment group over 6 weeks, and in the combined etoricoxib group over 1 year (all P < 0.05); results for secondary and exploratory end points were generally consistent with those from the primary analysis. Among all groups, there were no significant differences in the incidence of overall clinical, drug-related, or serious adverse experiences (AEs) and discontinuations due to AEs. Safety observations during part II were generally consistent with those in part I.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEtoricoxib at doses of 90 mg and 120 mg demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo over 6 weeks, and compared with naproxen over 1 year. These study results demonstrate that etoricoxib is generally safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious for the treatment of AS.",

            "abstract": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, have come to play an important role in the pharmacologic management of arthritis and pain. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of etoricoxib in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, low back pain, acute postoperative pain, and primary dysmenorrhea. Comparative studies indicate at least similar efficacy with etoricoxib versus traditional NSAIDs. Etoricoxib was generally well tolerated in these studies with no new safety findings during long-term administration. The gastrointestinal, renovascular, and cardiovascular tolerability profiles of etoricoxib have been evaluated in large patient datasets, and further insight into the cardiovascular tolerability of etoricoxib and diclofenac will be gained from a large ongoing cardiovascular outcomes program (MEDAL). The available data suggest that etoricoxib is an efficacious alternative in the management of arthritis and pain, with the potential advantages of convenient once-daily administration and superior gastrointestinal tolerability compared with traditional NSAIDs.",

            "abstract": "Tendinopathies are a major cause of disability in the athletic population; the main purpose of the treatment of these injuries is to reduce pain and improve function promptly. The objective of this randomized, active comparator controlled, blinded study was to evaluate etoricoxib efficacy in pain control and leg stiffness in athletes suffering acute unilateral Achilles tendinopathy. Fifty-six eligible male athletes (mean age 37.5 \u00b1 11.0 y) suffering acute Achilles tendinopathy were randomized to receive either etoricoxib 120 mg oral once daily (n=28) or diclofenac 100 mg oral once daily (n=28). Pain (100-mm visual analogue scale-VAS), analgesic effect (percentage of 100-mm VAS reduction), satisfaction with pain management (PGART), and leg stiffness (LSR) were evaluated after one week of anti-inflammatory treatment. Over the 7-day treatment period, both etoricoxib and diclofenac provided significantly relief of Achilles tendon pain compared to that experienced at baseline (mean VAS 26.7 \u00b1 2.2 and 56.4 \u00b1 1.8, respectively; p<.001). Analgesic effect averaged 53.7 \u00b1 38.1% (etoricoxib= 56.4% and diclofenac 50.6%, p=0.64). Patients referred high level of satisfaction with anti-inflammatory treatment (PGART = 2.0 \u00b1 1.3), while leg stiffness showed a significant improvement after one-week therapy (LSR 0.89 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 0.95 \u00b1 0.1; p=0.038). PGART and LSR values within etoricoxib and diclofenac groups were not significant (p=0.46, and p=0.37, respectively). Both drugs were generally well tolerated; patients receiving etoricoxib reported significantly less side effects than those in the diclofenac group (0% and 14,2%, respectively, p=0.037). Etoricoxib is clinically effective in treatment of acute Achilles tendinopathy providing a magnitude of effect comparable to that of diclofenac with fewer side effects. Effective control of tendon pain in the acute phase of such sports-related injuries may be helpful to reduce morbidity and improve capabilities associated with high performance like leg stiffness.",

The activity of axSpA (BASDAI, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) was evaluated at baseline, 2 and 12 weeks; adverse events were recorded at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. The number of patients who had achieved an ASAS40 response at 2 and 12 weeks were taken into consideration. RESULTS At 12 weeks, the continuous administration group displayed decreases in BASDAI from 8 to 4, in ASDAS from 3.8 to 2.6, and in hs-CRP levels from 9.5 to 3.9 mg/l; the intermittent administration group exhibited decreases in BASDAI from 7.6 to 6.0, in ASDAS from 3.5 to 3.1, and hs-CRP from 8.8 to 4.5 mg/l (p<0.05). At this time, an AS40 response was achieved by 22 (73.3%) and 2 (20%) patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.05 for all). No serious adverse events were recorded.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe efficacy of ET given in a daily dose of 90 mg was much higher than that of the drug used thrice or less weekly in the patients with axSpA.",

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of long-term and short-term continuous NSAIDs in patients with knee osteoarthritis with insufficient efficacy \u201con demand\u201d NSAIDs and SYSADOA.Study design. 12-week, prospective, comparative, randomized, single-center study.Materials and Methods. 180 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis aged 40 to 85 years with insufficient efficacy of \u201con demand\u201d NSAIDs and SYSADOA were examined. Anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended for everyone: 56 people took Naproxen (31.11%), 63 \u2014 Etoricoxib (35%), 61 \u2014 Ketoprofen (33.89%). Patients were randomized into two groups: 1st group \u2014 with 8-week continuous intake of NSAIDs, 2nd group \u2014 with a 2-week continuous course of NSAIDs.Results. There was a positive dynamics of pain syndrome according to VAS and decrease in the level of the WOMAC index in both groups after 2 weeks of therapy. The pain level (VAS) and WOMAC indices in 1st group achieved after 8 weeks significantly differed from the ones after 2 weeks of therapy (VAS dynamics \u201410.93\u00b12.43 mm, t = 42.64; p<0.001). In both groups we noted gradual significant increase in the average pain level according to VAS and WOMAC indices after NSAIDs cancellation. However, there was better control of pain in 1st group with long-term NSAID than in 2nd one. Safety profile of drug therapy was similar in both groups.Conclusion. The long-term 8-week use of NSAIDs in patients with knee osteoarthritis with insufficient efficacy \u201con demand\u201d NSAIDs and SYSADOA provides better dynamics of the pain syndrome than with 2-week therapy. After treatment is canceled longer prior NSAID therapy contributes to better control of the pain syndrome. Continuous use of NSAIDs demonstrated good tolerance and safety, did not require dose reduction and/or discontinuation of therapy. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy of osteoarthritis in this group of patients may be prescribed for a longer period with continuous use of NSAIDs.",

Osteoarthritis (OA) in the Russian Federation is still not included in the list of socially significant diseases, despite the fact that this pathology limits the level of physical activity of the population more than diseases of the cardiovascular system, visual impairment and diabetes. European experts emphasize the relevance of research to develop methods to improve the effectiveness of viscosupplementary therapy in OA. The purpose of the study. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and long-term results of treatment of gonarthrosis with sodium hyaluronate.Materials and methods. The study included 180 patients with gonarthrosis with insufficient efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on demand and oral symptomatic slow-acting drugs against osteoarthritis (SYSADOA). The patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1: 50 patients who received sodium hyaluronate (Ripart\u00ae; Ingal, Russia) intra-articularly. Group 2: 30 patients received intra-articular SYSADOA (bioactive concentrate of small marine fish). The control group consisted of 100 patients who received drugs of the SYSADOA group intramuscularly.Results. An effective reduction in pain both at rest and during movement was achieved in most patients of all groups, but the treatment groups differed statistically significantly in the speed of achieving the clinical effect and its duration. In the 1st group, a significant decrease in the VAS pain index was observed already at the 1st week and by the 3rd month it was \u201349.1 % (p < 0.001). In the comparison and control groups, the indicators of speed, the degree of pain reduction, and the duration of the effect of therapy were also significant (p \u2264 0.050). But the effectiveness of therapy in these groups was statistically significantly lower than in patients of group 1 (p \u2265 0.050). It should be emphasized that the intra-articular administration of sodium hyaluronate provided a significant reduction in the need for patients to additionally take NSAIDs. After 3 months of therapy, only 5 patients (10 %) of this group continued to take NSAIDs (p < 0.001); 20 \u2013 completely stopped taking NSAIDs (40 %) and 25 (50 %) reduced the dose of NSAIDs taken, the duration of the effect lasted up to 12 months.Conclusions. In our study, sodium hyaluronate demonstrated high efficiency in reducing pain in patients with gonarthrosis and contributed to a significant decrease in the need for patients to take NSAIDs for 12 months.",

Functional limitations, chronic pain syndrome worsen the\u00a0quality of\u00a0life\u00a0(QoL) in\u00a0OA of\u00a0the joints of\u00a0the lower extremities. QoL significantly depends on the\u00a0effectiveness and methods of\u00a0pain treatment, correction of\u00a0functional disorders.Aim. Evaluation of\u00a0the dynamics of\u00a0QoL in\u00a0patients with gonarthrosis treated with a\u00a0high-tech synovial fluid prosthesis\u00a0\u2013 sodium hyaluronate, domestic production.Materials and methods. The study group consisted of 50 patients who received intra-articular (IA) injections of domestically produced sodium hyaluronate (OOO Ingal, Russia). Comparison group \u2013 30 patients treated with 2 ml of symptomatic drugs of delayed action (SYSADOA) (bioactive concentrate of small marine fish) administrated IA No. 5. Control group \u2013 100 patients treated with a 1 ml of SYSADOA drugs administrated intramuscularly (IM) No. 20. Study program: 12 months, 6 visits with prospective monitoring of the quality of life of patients according to SF-36 compared with baseline data.Results. At the\u00a0time of\u00a0inclusion, patients had a\u00a0similar level of\u00a0physical and mental health components, which did not differ statistically significantly\u00a0(p\u00a0= 0.369\u00a0and p\u00a0= 0.089). The study group demonstrated the\u00a0best dynamics of\u00a0the physical and mental components of\u00a0health. The therapy was effective in\u00a0all groups: most patients showed a\u00a0statistically significant decrease in\u00a0pain syndrome, an increase in\u00a0QoL. The groups differed significantly in\u00a0the speed of\u00a0achieving the\u00a0effect of\u00a0pain relief, the\u00a0severity of\u00a0pain reduction and the\u00a0duration of\u00a0the effect of\u00a0treatment.Conclusions. The spectrum of side effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) does not allow their use for pain relief indefinitely. SYSADOAs become less effective in the progression of OA than in the early stages of the disease. The positive clinical effect of intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate solutions occurs faster and lasts longer than when using SYSADOA.",
