Bone marker levels were correlated with the presence or absence of bone metastases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSerum TRACP 5b concentrations exhibited the largest area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC=0.845), followed by ICTP (0.818) and tALP (0.814) when all patients were included in the analysis. With the combination of TRACP 5b and ICTP, the AUC increased to 0.881. In multivariate regression analysis, all three markers were significant predictors of bone metastases.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSerum TRACP 5b, ICTP and tALP exhibited equal performances in the detection of bone metastases. The combination of TRACP with ICTP did not significantly improve the detection of bone metastases over tALP.",

Bone marker levels were correlated with the presence or absence of bone metastases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSerum TRACP 5b concentrations exhibited the largest area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC=0.845), followed by ICTP (0.818) and tALP (0.814) when all patients were included in the analysis. With the combination of TRACP 5b and ICTP, the AUC increased to 0.881. In multivariate regression analysis, all three markers were significant predictors of bone metastases.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSerum TRACP 5b, ICTP and tALP exhibited equal performances in the detection of bone metastases. The combination of TRACP with ICTP did not significantly improve the detection of bone metastases over tALP.",

            "abstract": "Bone metastasis is common in lung cancer patients and associated with reduced quality of life and reduced overall and median survival, so the early detection of bone metastasis and monitoring of its status is very important for clinicians. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin (OC), beta isomer of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were compared with regard to their usefulness as indicators of bone metastasis in lung cancer. The serum concentrations of the 4 markers were measured by commercially available tests in 96 male patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 30 male patients with other pulmonary diseases. The levels of both \u00e2-CTX and ICTP were significantly higher in 61 lung cancer patients with bone metastases than in 35 lung cancer patients without bone metastases (both p<0.001), and significantly correlated with the extent of bone disease. Although ICTP had a better sensitivity and accuracy than beta-CTX (75.4% vs 65.6% and 72.9% vs 68.8%, respectively), they had a similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.85 vs 0.83). These results support the use of beta-CTX and ICTP as an adjunct tool for the diagnosis and screening of bone metastasis in lung cancer.",

Material/Methods Forty 8-week-old female apoE\u2013knockout mice on the C57BL/6J background were divided into 4 groups and put on chow diet for 4 months. Three experimental groups received the same diet as a control group, mixed with AVE 0991 at a dose 0.58 \u03bcmol per kg of body weight per day, nebivolol at a dose 2.0 \u03bcmol per kg of body weight per day, and doxycycline at a dose 1.5 mg per kg of body weight per day. At the age of 6 months, the mice were sacrificed. Results All inflammatory indicators (MCP-1, IL-6, IL-12 and SAA) were diminished by AVE 0991. There was also a tendency to lower MCP-1, IL-6, IL-12 and SAA levels by nebivolol and doxycycline; however, it did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions Of the 3 presented substances, only AVE 0991 was able to diminish the rise of inflammatory markers. Therefore, drug manipulations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis seem to be the most promising in the future treatment of atherogenesis.",

            "abstract": "The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or the blockade of angiotensin (Ang) AT-1 receptors affords protection against acute gastric mucosal injury, but whether the major metabolite of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), Ang-(1-7), accelerates the healing process of preexisting gastric ulcers remains unknown. Previous studies documented that Ang-(1-7) acting via its own Mas receptor exerts vascular responses opposing those of Ang II. We studied the effects of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis on the healing rate of acetic-acid-induced gastric ulcers with or without the blockade of Mas receptors by A 779 and compared it with the effects of activation and blockade of the AT-1 receptor by the treatment with Ang II and losartan, respectively, the inhibition of ACE by lisinopril, the NO/cNOS inhibition by L-NAME and inhibition of prostaglandin/COX system by indomethacin in the presence of Ang-(1-7). Additionally, ex vivo metabolism of Ang I in gastric tissue was assessed by LC/MS method. At day 9 after ulcer induction, the area of these ulcers and the accompanying changes in total gastric blood flow (GBF) were determined as were gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) at ulcer margin and gastric oxygen uptake (GVO2). The gastric mucosal expression of mRNAs for constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and plasma level of both cytokines were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. The 9 days treatment with Ang II dose-dependently increased the area of gastric ulcers and this effect was accompanied by a significant fall in the GBF, GVO2 and GMBF at ulcer margin. In contrast, treatment with Ang-(1-7) which produced a significant rise in the luminal content of NO significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcer and significantly increased the GBF, GVO2 and the GMBF at ulcer margin. Similar GMBF changes and significant reduction the area of gastric ulcer was observed in rats with gastric ulcers treated with the agonist of Mas receptor, AVE 0991. These effects of Ang-(1-7) and AVE 0991 were eliminated by blockade of the Mas receptor with A779. Similarly to Ang-(1-7), treatment with losartan or lisinopril significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcers and the accompanying increase in the GMBF at ulcer margin and these effects were significantly attenuated by a concomitant administration of L-NAME and indomethacin. The rate of healing of ulcers was associated with a decrease in ex vivo Ang-(1-7) formation and this effect was attenuated by lisinopril. The treatment with Ang-(1- 7) or AVE 0991 increased the expression of mRNA for cNOS and SOD and downregulated that of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 followed by the decrease in the plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. We conclude that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor system accelerates the healing of preexisting gastric ulcers via an increase in the gastric macro- and microcirculations, and an increase in gastric tissue oxygenation. These effects are mediated by PG and NO derived from overexpression of cNOS, an increase in the expression of antioxidizing enzyme SOD 2 and an anti-inflammatory action involving the inhibition of expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Our results seem to underlie the importance of the Ang-(1-7), AT-1 and Mas receptors in the regulation of local vascular and metabolic effects associated with mechanism of gastric ulcer healing.",

            "abstract": "The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or the blockade of angiotensin (Ang) AT-1 receptors affords protection against acute gastric mucosal injury, but whether the major metabolite of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), Ang-(1-7), accelerates the healing process of preexisting gastric ulcers remains unknown. Previous studies documented that Ang-(1-7) acting via its own Mas receptor exerts vascular responses opposing those of Ang II. We studied the effects of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis on the healing rate of acetic-acid-induced gastric ulcers with or without the blockade of Mas receptors by A 779 and compared it with the effects of activation and blockade of the AT-1 receptor by the treatment with Ang II and losartan, respectively, the inhibition of ACE by lisinopril, the NO/cNOS inhibition by L-NAME and inhibition of prostaglandin/COX system by indomethacin in the presence of Ang-(1-7). Additionally, ex vivo metabolism of Ang I in gastric tissue was assessed by LC/MS method. At day 9 after ulcer induction, the area of these ulcers and the accompanying changes in total gastric blood flow (GBF) were determined as were gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) at ulcer margin and gastric oxygen uptake (GVO2). The gastric mucosal expression of mRNAs for constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and plasma level of both cytokines were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. The 9 days treatment with Ang II dose-dependently increased the area of gastric ulcers and this effect was accompanied by a significant fall in the GBF, GVO2 and GMBF at ulcer margin. In contrast, treatment with Ang-(1-7) which produced a significant rise in the luminal content of NO significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcer and significantly increased the GBF, GVO2 and the GMBF at ulcer margin. Similar GMBF changes and significant reduction the area of gastric ulcer was observed in rats with gastric ulcers treated with the agonist of Mas receptor, AVE 0991. These effects of Ang-(1-7) and AVE 0991 were eliminated by blockade of the Mas receptor with A779. Similarly to Ang-(1-7), treatment with losartan or lisinopril significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcers and the accompanying increase in the GMBF at ulcer margin and these effects were significantly attenuated by a concomitant administration of L-NAME and indomethacin. The rate of healing of ulcers was associated with a decrease in ex vivo Ang-(1-7) formation and this effect was attenuated by lisinopril. The treatment with Ang-(1- 7) or AVE 0991 increased the expression of mRNA for cNOS and SOD and downregulated that of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 followed by the decrease in the plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. We conclude that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor system accelerates the healing of preexisting gastric ulcers via an increase in the gastric macro- and microcirculations, and an increase in gastric tissue oxygenation. These effects are mediated by PG and NO derived from overexpression of cNOS, an increase in the expression of antioxidizing enzyme SOD 2 and an anti-inflammatory action involving the inhibition of expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Our results seem to underlie the importance of the Ang-(1-7), AT-1 and Mas receptors in the regulation of local vascular and metabolic effects associated with mechanism of gastric ulcer healing.",

            "abstract": "Background: Gastric ulcer is a chronic disease featured with repeated healing and recurrence. Angiogenesis is one of important factors for the healing process. Angiotensin II (ANG II) involves in cell proliferation and tissue repair. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of ANG II type 1A on gastric ulcer healing. Methods and Results: Gastric ulcers were induced by the serosal application of 100% acetic acid. The gastric ulcerated areas were significantly enlarged in mice treated with ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker (ARB) compared to those in vehicle-treated mice. The number of cluster of differentiation (CD31) positive cells in the ulcerated area was lower in ARB-treated mice. There was prolonged gastric healing in the AT1a knock out (KO) mice compared to that in the wild-type (WT) mice. The mRNA (messenger RNA) levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the ulcerated area were significantly suppressed in AT1aKO mice compared to those in WT mice. The number of accumulated CD11b+ cells, the marker for macrophages, in the ulcer granulation was lower in AT1aKO mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CD11b+ macrophages co-stained with SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b2 in the ulcerated area in WT mice had increased compared with those in AT1aKO mice. Conclusion: These results suggested that ANG II-AT1a signaling induces gastric ulcer healing by TGF-\u03b2 and SDF-1 production from accumulated macrophages.",

            "abstract": "Objective The present study was designed to evaluate the possible gastroprotective effects of different doses of azilsartan in ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats. Methodology Forty-eight male adult Wistar rats were used and allocated randomly into four groups: negative control treated with distilled water, positive control treated with ethanol, lansoprazole treated group, and azilsartan (1mg, 5mg, and 10mg/kg) treated group. The treatment protocol was for 15 days, and all the groups except for the negative control group received 1mL of ethanol on the last day 1hr before scarification. Gastric content was collected for measuring the volume, free acidity, and pH. The stomach was used for measuring the gastric lesion area and ulcer index. Blood samples were collected for measuring serum hydroxyproline, gastrin, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, MDA, and TAOC. Gastric tissues were sent for histopathological examinations. Results Ethanol administration significantly increased gastric lesion, gastric ulcer index, and gastric acidity. Ethanol also decreased serum levels of hydroxyproline and TAOC and increased serum gastrin, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA. Azilsartan 10mg/kg was able to decrease the lesion by 43.6% and increase gastric pH and significantly decreased MDA level. Both 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg azilsartan have successfully restored the level of hydroxyproline, gastrin, and TNF-\u03b1. The histopathological finding showed gastroprotection by azilsartan in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion The study revealed that azilsartan possesses a gastroprotective effect. The proposed mechanisms could be increased blood flow to the stomach, antioxidant capacity, and anti-inflammatory activity along with restoring hydroxyproline and gastrin levels. These findings suggest azilsartan as a promising candidate to be tested in a clinical setting.",

            "abstract": "Azilsartan, a known angiotensin receptor blocker, has shown potential in reducing 24-hour blood pressure and may have protective effects against cardiac complications. Increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue is directly related to the cardiac complications of doxorubicin. This study investigated whether azilsartan could mitigate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. We divided 28 male rats into four groups: the control group receiving a standard diet and water, the vehicle group given DMSO orally for two weeks, doxorubicin group receiving 2.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin three times a week for two weeks, and azilsartan group treated with 5 mg/kg/day of azilsartan orally and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was evidenced by a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MDA, and caspase-3 levels and significantly decreased TAC and Bcl-2 levels in the cardiac tissues of treated rats compared to the DMSO and control groups. Azilsartan significantly decreased doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, as evidenced by a decline in serum levels of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Additionally, MDA significantly decreased in the cardiac tissue, although TAC was significantly increased when comparing the azilsartan group to the group receiving doxorubicin-only. These results suggest that azilsartan effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, likely by mitigating apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in cardiac tissues.",
