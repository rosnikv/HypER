            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether a 6-month home-based intervention program in adolescents with poorly controlled diabetes improves metabolic control and whether benefits are maintained after the intervention.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nAdolescents with a mean HbA1c of > 9.0% over the preceding 12 months received either routine care in a diabetes clinic and an ambulatory intervention for 6 months (n = 37) or routine care only (n = 32). A diabetes educator provided monthly home visits and weekly phone contact to educate and support the adolescents in setting goals for insulin adjustment, blood glucose monitoring, and target blood glucose range. There was no systematic change in the frequency of insulin injections. After the intervention, there was a 12-month follow-up when the intervention and control groups both received only routine care. Outcome measures were HbA1c and Diabetes Knowledge Assessment (DKN).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the intervention, mean HbA1c fell (baseline: 11.1 +/- 1.3%, 6 months: 9.7 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.0001) and mean knowledge scores increased (P = 0.0001) in the intervention group but not in control subjects. However, this improvement in HbA1c and increase in knowledge was not maintained in the intervention group at 12- and 18-month follow-up assessments. Parents' knowledge scores also improved significantly from baseline levels in the intervention group at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn ambulatory program improves metabolic control and knowledge in adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes; however, it is effective only while the intervention is maintained.",

METHODS Fifty-three adolescents aged 13 to 17 with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a 6-week problem-solving diabetes education program or to a control group (usual care).

RESULTS The experimental group participants showed significantly improved problem-solving test scores and Al C values from baseline to 6 months, changes not evident in the control group. At 6 months, the experimental group participants were doing blood glucose testing more often than those in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in problem-solving test scores or Al C values.

Based on these research findings, recommendations for optimal psychological care are offered. The research base for the psychological care of young people with type 2 diabetes is sparse.

This chapter reviews the main findings from studies of psychological adjustment, psychiatric disorders, neurocognitive and educational functioning, family dynamics, social support, stress and coping, quality of life, and behavioral interventions in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Based on these research findings, recommendations for optimal psychological care are offered. The research base for the psychological care of young people with type 2 diabetes is sparse. Therefore, this chapter does not address type 2 diabetes specifically. The ISPAD Consensus Guidelines 2000 stated that \u2018\u2018Psychosocial factors are the most important influences affecting the care and management of diabetes,\u2019\u2019 and went on to make the following three general recommendations (7):",

An independent sample of primary caretakers of 87 children aged 10 to 16 years with type 1 diabetes completed the measure of parenting goals (diabetes-specific and general goals); both parent and child completed measures of parent responsibility for diabetes management at baseline and 6 months. Parents ranked diabetes-specific parenting goals as more important than general parenting goals, and rankings were moderately stable over time. Parenting goals were related to parent responsibility for diabetes management. The relative ranking of diabetes-specific parenting goals predicted changes in parent involvement over 6 months, with baseline ranking of goals predicting more parental involvement at follow-up. Parenting goals may play an important role in family management of type 1 diabetes.",

The study investigated whether multisystemic therapy (MST), an intensive home-based family therapy, was superior to family support for changing beliefs regarding asthma-related positive parenting among caregivers of African-American youth with poorly controlled asthma. The relationship between parenting beliefs and asthma management at the conclusion of the intervention was also assessed. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 167 adolescents with moderate-to-severe, persistent, poorly controlled asthma and their primary caregivers. Families were randomly assigned to MST or family support (FS), a home-based family support condition. Data were collected at baseline and 7-month posttest. Changes in caregiver ratings of importance and confidence for engaging in asthma-related positive parenting were assessed through questionnaire. Illness management was assessed by the Family Asthma Management System Scale. Results: Participation in MST was associated with more change in caregiver beliefs as compared with FS for both importance (t = 2.39, p = .02) and confidence (t = 2.04, p = .04). Caregiver beliefs were also significantly related to youth controller medication adherence at the conclusion of treatment (importance: r = .21, p = .01; confidence: r = .23, p = .004). Conclusion: Results support the effectiveness of MST for increasing parental beliefs in the value of asthma-related positive parenting behaviors and parental self-efficacy for these behaviors among families of minority adolescents with poorly controlled asthma.",

As part of a three-arm cluster randomized dissemination study, evaluation of the impact of different dissemination methods was studied. Here we evaluate themes from patient and provider focus groups to assess the impact of a facilitated, traditional dissemination approach, or no intervention, on patient and provider perspectives of asthma care. Methods: Using semi-structured questions, twenty-four pre- and post-intervention focus groups with patients and providers took place across primary care practices. Discussions were held in all three arms both before and after the time of intervention rollout. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed for themes. Results: Across all sites patients and providers discussed themes of communication, asthma self-management, barriers, education, and patient awareness. After the intervention, compared to traditional sites, facilitated practices were more likely to discuss themes related to SDM, such as patient-centered communication, patient-provider negotiation on treatment plan, planning, goal-setting, and solutions to barriers. Conclusions: Emergent themes allowed for further understanding of how the SDM implementation was perceived at the patient and provider level. The facilitated implementation was associated with higher adoption of the SDM intervention. These themes and supporting quotes add to knowledge of best practices associated with implementing an evidence-based SDM intervention for asthma into primary care and will inform researchers, practices, and providers as they work to improve adoption of evidence-based interventions into practice.",
