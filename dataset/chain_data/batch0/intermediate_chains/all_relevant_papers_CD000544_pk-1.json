        "title": "New salicylates as maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis.",
        "abstract": "For decades sulphasalazine has been the only valuable non-corticosteroid drug in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Then Truelove et al showed that the pharmacologically active moiety in sulphasalazine for the treatment of this disease was 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).' This resulted in new 5-ASA formulations for topical and oral use. 5-ASA enemas and suppositories seem to have the same efficacy as topical corticosteroids in active distal ulcerative colitis.2 3 Sulphasalazine is not as effective as corticosteroids for the treatment of widespread active disease, and there is no evidence that any of the newer salicylates is better in this respect.4 Because extensive, active ulcerative colitis must be treated aggressively so that it does not become severe and require surgery, systemic corticosteroids are always the first alternative in these cases. Maintenance treatment is therefore the main indication for oral use of sulphasalazine and the new salicylates in ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis was unable to show that any of the new salicylates was more efficient than sulphasalazine.4 There are three factors to consider when choosing which drug to use: (1) effectiveness; (2) which formulation delivers 5-ASA to the colon with the fewest systemic effects; and (3) safety. The formulations and sites of 5-ASA release of various new 5-ASA based drugs are shown in the Table.",
