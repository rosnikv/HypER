Its goals of therapy are to eliminate the symptoms of hyperglycaemia, reduce the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications and allow the patients to achieve a normal life-style. Basal insulin replacement for insulin dependent patients can be achieved with either intermediate or long acting insulin preparations.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of intermediate acting versus long acting insulin preparations for basal insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, as well as reference lists, databases of ongoing trials, and requests from authors of included trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials, assessing long acting insulin preparations compared to intermediate acting insulin preparations, in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo reviewers independently scanned the titles. Data were extracted and analysed accordingly.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nTwenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified. A total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively, were analysed. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the level of glycosylated haemoglobin was -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.04) in favour of the long acting insulin arm. The WMD between the groups in fasting plasma and blood glucose levels was -0.63 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.40) and -0.86 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.72) in favour of the long acting insulins. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulin to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. The OR for severe hypoglycaemic episodes was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), and 0.70 (95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79) for nocturnal episodes. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups for hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow up days was -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.65), -0.0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and -0.40 (95% CI -0.45 to -0.34) for overall, severe, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Weight gain was more prominent in the control group. No difference was noted in the quantity or quality of severe adverse events or deaths.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLong acting insulin preparations seem to exert a beneficial effect on nocturnal glucose levels. Their effect on the overall diabetes control is clinically unremarkable. Their use as a basal insulin regimen for type 1 diabetes mellitus warrants further substantiation.",

            "abstract": "Hypoglycaemia remains the major limiting factor for adequate diabetes control for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), especially during the night\u2010time. Although nutritional strategies for nocturnal hypoglycaemia (NH) prevention are regularly suggested in clinical practice, there is no evidence\u2010based recommendation for the usefulness and optimal composition of a bedtime snack. The aim of this narrative review was to analyse the current state of knowledge on nutritional strategies to prevent NH in individuals with T1D. A literature search was conducted, using PubMed and Medline (1946 to 2013); 16 studies were retrieved. Overall, the level of evidence was low. Results indicated that a calibrated bedtime snack based on bedtime blood glucose (BG) level could be effective to reduce NH occurrence for patients treated with human or animal insulin (short\u2010acting combined with lente, ultralente and/or intermediate\u2010acting insulin), but there is no evidence for patients treated with insulin analogues as part of multiple daily injections or insulin pump regimen. Some evidence suggests that including uncooked cornstarch or alanine in the bedtime snack composition could provide some benefits for the prevention of NH. Individualized recommendations of a bedtime snack intake for patients or situations at high risk for NH (long standing diabetes, hypoglycaemia unawareness, prior physical activity, alcohol consumption, bedtime BG close to hypoglycaemia threshold) appear as a prudent recommendation. On the basis of the available evidence, a bedtime snack cannot be recommended systematically but it might be useful if prescribed in an individualized fashion; further research is needed to evaluate these strategies.",

Recommendations for normalizing glycemia around exercise consist of prandial adjustments to bolus insulin therapy and food composition, but this carries only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of a combined basal-bolus insulin dose reduction and carbohydrate feeding strategy on glycemia and metabolic parameters following evening exercise in type 1 diabetes. Methods Ten male participants (glycated hemoglobin: 52.4\u00b12.2\u2005mmol/mol), treated with multiple daily injections, completed two randomized study-days, whereby administration of total daily basal insulin dose was unchanged (100%), or reduced by 20% (80%). Participants attended the laboratory at \u223c08:00\u2005h for a fasted blood sample, before returning in the evening. On arrival (\u223c17:00\u2005h), participants consumed a carbohydrate meal and administered a 75% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose and 60\u2005min later performed 45\u2005min of treadmill running.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Automated insulin delivery is the new standard for type 1 diabetes, but exercise-related hypoglycemia remains a challenge. Our aim was to determine whether a dual-hormone closed-loop system using wearable sensors to detect exercise and adjust dosing to reduce exercise-related hypoglycemia would outperform other forms of closed-loop and open-loop therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants underwent four arms in randomized order: dual-hormone, single-hormone, predictive low glucose suspend, and continuation of current care over 4 outpatient days. Each arm included three moderate-intensity aerobic exercise sessions. The two primary outcomes were percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and in a target range (70\u2013180 mg/dL) assessed across the entire study and from the start of the in-clinic exercise until the next meal. RESULTS The analysis included 20 adults with type 1 diabetes who completed all arms. The mean time (SD) in hypoglycemia was the lowest with dual-hormone during the exercise period: 3.4% (4.5) vs. 8.3% (12.6) single-hormone (P = 0.009) vs. 7.6% (8.0) predictive low glucose suspend (P < 0.001) vs. 4.3% (6.8) current care where pre-exercise insulin adjustments were allowed (P = 0.49). Time in hypoglycemia was also the lowest with dual-hormone during the entire 4-day study: 1.3% (1.0) vs. 2.8% (1.7) single-hormone (P < 0.001) vs. 2.0% (1.5) predictive low glucose suspend (P = 0.04) vs. 3.1% (3.2) current care (P = 0.007). Time in range during the entire study was the highest with single-hormone: 74.3% (8.0) vs. 72.0% (10.8) dual-hormone (P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS The addition of glucagon delivery to a closed-loop system with automated exercise detection reduces hypoglycemia in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes.",

Our aim was to determine whether a dual-hormone closed-loop system using wearable sensors to detect exercise and adjust dosing to reduce exercise-related hypoglycemia would outperform other forms of closed-loop and open-loop therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants underwent four arms in randomized order: dual-hormone, single-hormone, predictive low glucose suspend, and continuation of current care over 4 outpatient days. Each arm included three moderate-intensity aerobic exercise sessions. The two primary outcomes were percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and in a target range (70\u2013180 mg/dL) assessed across the entire study and from the start of the in-clinic exercise until the next meal. RESULTS The analysis included 20 adults with type 1 diabetes who completed all arms. The mean time (SD) in hypoglycemia was the lowest with dual-hormone during the exercise period: 3.4% (4.5) vs. 8.3% (12.6) single-hormone (P = 0.009) vs. 7.6% (8.0) predictive low glucose suspend (P < 0.001) vs. 4.3% (6.8) current care where pre-exercise insulin adjustments were allowed (P = 0.49).

Materials and Methods: A 96-h hybrid closed-loop (HCL) study was conducted in a supervised hotel/rental home setting following a 7-day outpatient standard therapy (ST) phase. Eligible participants were aged 6\u201365 years with A1C <10.0% using insulin pump therapy or multiple daily injections. Meals during HCL were unrestricted, with boluses administered per usual routine. There was daily physical activity. The primary endpoints were percentage of time with sensor glucose <70 and \u2265250\u2009mg/dL. Results: Participants were 11 adults, 10 adolescents, and 15 children aged (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) 28.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9, 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, and 9.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 years, respectively.

Percentage time <70\u2009mg/dL during HCL was 1.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3%, 2.5%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0%, and 2.2%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9%, a statistically significant decrease in adults when compared to ST (P\u2009=\u20090.005, P\u2009=\u20090.3, and P\u2009=\u20090.3). Percentage time 70\u2013180\u2009mg/dL increased during HCL compared to ST, reaching significance for adolescents and children: HCL 73.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5% vs. ST 68.0%\u2009\u00b1\u200915.6% for adults (P\u2009=\u20090.08), HCL 79.0%\u2009\u00b1\u200912.6% vs. ST 60.6%\u2009\u00b1\u200913.4% for adolescents (P\u2009=\u20090.01), and HCL 69.2%\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5% vs. ST 54.9%\u2009\u00b1\u200912.9% for children (P\u2009=\u20090.003).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In an open-label, prospective, randomized crossover trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04835350), 16 adolescents with T1D (10 females) with mean age 17 years (range 15-20), HbA1c 56 mmol/mol (range 43-75) and mean duration of diabetes 5.9 years (9-15), underwent three distinct 3-day periods of camp living, comparing the above-mentioned scenarios of AndroidAPS. We used modified and locked version of AndroidAPS 3.1.03 which was called Pancreas4ALL for study purpose. The order of MA and FCL periods was assigned randomly. The primary endpoints were feasibility and safety of the system represented by percentage of time of glucose control by the system and time in hypoglycemia below 3 mmol/L. RESULTS The glycemia was controlled by the system 95% time of the study and the proportion of time below 3 mmol/L did not exceed 1% over the whole study period (0.72%). The HCL scenario reached significantly higher percentage of time below 3 mmol/L (HCL 1.05% vs MA 0.0% vs FCL 0.0%; p=0.05) compared to other scenarios. No differences were observed among the scenarios in the percentage of time between 3.9-10 mmol/L (HCL 83.3% vs MA 79.85% vs FCL 81.03%, p=0.58) corresponding to mean glycemia (HCL 6.65mmol/L vs MA 7.34mmol/L vs FCL-7.05mmol/L, p=0.28). No differences were observed in the mean daily dose of insulin nor in the daily carbohydrate intake. No serious adverse events occurred during the study period. CONCLUSIONS Our pilot study showed that Fully Closed Loop might be a realistic mode of treatment for people with type 1 diabetes.",
