The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impacts of long\u2010term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with quiescent CD. Methods: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion during the nighttime and a low\u2010fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20 received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non\u2010EN group). With these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further, ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies were taken for cytokine assays. Results: On an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis, 5 patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non\u2010EN group had a clinical relapse during the 1\u2010year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in the non\u2010EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal tissue interleukin (IL)\u20101&bgr;, IL\u20106, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010&agr; levels significantly increased with time in the non\u2010EN group (entry versus 12 months, IL\u20101&bgr;, P = 0.02; IL\u20106, P = 0.002; TNF\u2010&agr;, P = 0.001). In the EN group these cytokines did not show a significant increase. Conclusions: Long\u2010term enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels.

The CLA-enriched milk fat significantly increased mouse body weights after 24d of treatment, reduced epithelium damage, and downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and nitrous oxide. Modulen IBD most effectively decreased the clinical score at d 12, and Modulen IBD and OPN most effectively lowered the inflammatory score. Myeloperoxidase activity that denotes neutrophil infiltration was significantly lower in mice fed Modulen IBD, OPN, angiogenin, and Fe-bLF. A significant decrease in the numbers of T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and a significant decrease in cytokine expression were observed in mice fed the treatment diets compared with dextran sulfate administered mice. The Fe-bLF, CLA-enriched milk fat, and Modulen IBD inhibited intestinal angiogenesis.

Myeloperoxidase activity that denotes neutrophil infiltration was significantly lower in mice fed Modulen IBD, OPN, angiogenin, and Fe-bLF. A significant decrease in the numbers of T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and a significant decrease in cytokine expression were observed in mice fed the treatment diets compared with dextran sulfate administered mice. The Fe-bLF, CLA-enriched milk fat, and Modulen IBD inhibited intestinal angiogenesis. In summary, each of the milk components attenuated IBD in mice, but with differing effectiveness against specific disease parameters.",

The source paper investigates the effect of Modulen IBD on maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Although both papers involve Modulen IBD, the current paper does not directly build upon or depend on the source paper's findings. Instead, it investigates a different aspect of Modulen IBD's effects in a different context. Therefore, it is considered partially dependent on the source paper's findings, but the connection is not direct."

In this article, we review clinical studies which investigate non-pharmacological therapies for FD. We will also discuss potential mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of these non-pharmacological approaches. Though the evidences to support the routine use of the non-pharmacological management is still lacking, the non-invasive nature and potentially minimal side-effects of these therapies may be attractive in the FD management.
