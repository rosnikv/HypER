The aim of the present study was to investigate whether addition of metformin for 3 Months improves metabolic control and insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwenty-six of 30 randomised adolescents with type 1 diabetes (18 females, eight males) completed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Their mean age was 16.9+/-1.6 (s.d.) Years, mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 9.5+/-1.1% and daily insulin dosage 1.2+/-0.3 U/kg. The participants were randomised to receive oral metformin or placebo for 3 Months. HbA(1c) was measured Monthly, and peripheral insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp at baseline and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHbA(1c) decreased significantly in the group treated with metformin, from 9.6 to 8.7% (P<0.05), but was unchanged in the placebo group (9.5 vs 9.2%). Peripheral glucose uptake divided by mean plasma insulin concentration was increased in the metformin group (P<0.05) but not in the placebo group. Initial insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated to changes in HbA(1c) (r=-0.62; P<0.05) and positively correlated to changes in insulin sensitivity (r=0.77; P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this double-blind placebo-controlled study we found that metformin improves metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

Insulin regimen and dosage were modified in all subjects to achieve near-normal glycemic control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups experienced a significant reduction in HbA(1c) (A1C) level (rosiglitazone: 7.9 +/- 1.3 to 6.9 +/- 0.7%, P < 0.0001; placebo: 7.7 +/- 0.8 to 7.0 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.002) and a significant increase in weight (rosiglitazone: 97.2 +/- 11.8 to 100.6 +/- 16.0 kg, P = 0.008; placebo: 96.4 +/- 12.2 to 99.1 +/- 15.0, P = 0.016). Baseline measures of BMI (P = 0.001), total daily insulin dose (P = 0.002), total cholesterol (P = 0.005), HDL cholesterol (P = 0.001), and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) were predictors of improvement in A1C level only in the group treated with rosiglitazone. Total daily insulin dose increased in subjects taking placebo (74.0 +/- 33.8 to 82.0 +/- 48.9 units, P < 0.05 baseline vs. week 32), but it decreased slightly in subjects taking rosiglitazone (77.5 +/- 28.6 to 75.3 +/- 33.1 units). Both systolic blood pressure (137.4 +/- 15.6 vs. 128.8 +/- 14.8 mmHg, baseline vs. week 32, P < 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (87.2 +/- 9.4 vs. 79.4 +/- 7.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) improved in the group treated with rosiglitazone. The total incidence of hypoglycemia did not differ between groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRosiglitazone in combination with insulin resulted in improved glycemic control and blood pressure without an increase in insulin requirements, compared with insulin- and placebo-treated subjects, whose improved glycemic control required an 11% increase in insulin dose. Weight gain and hypoglycemia were similar in both groups at the end of the study. The greatest effect of rosiglitazone occurred in subjects with more pronounced markers of insulin resistance.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the safety and effectiveness of rosiglitazone in the treatment of overweight subjects with type 1 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 50 adult type 1 diabetic subjects with a baseline BMI > or =27 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to take insulin and placebo (n = 25) or insulin and rosiglitazone 4 mg twice daily (n = 25) for a period of 8 months. Insulin regimen and dosage were modified in all subjects to achieve near-normal glycemic control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth groups experienced a significant reduction in HbA(1c) (A1C) level (rosiglitazone: 7.9 +/- 1.3 to 6.9 +/- 0.7%, P < 0.0001; placebo: 7.7 +/- 0.8 to 7.0 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.002) and a significant increase in weight (rosiglitazone: 97.2 +/- 11.8 to 100.6 +/- 16.0 kg, P = 0.008; placebo: 96.4 +/- 12.2 to 99.1 +/- 15.0, P = 0.016). Baseline measures of BMI (P = 0.001), total daily insulin dose (P = 0.002), total cholesterol (P = 0.005), HDL cholesterol (P = 0.001), and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) were predictors of improvement in A1C level only in the group treated with rosiglitazone. Total daily insulin dose increased in subjects taking placebo (74.0 +/- 33.8 to 82.0 +/- 48.9 units, P < 0.05 baseline vs. week 32), but it decreased slightly in subjects taking rosiglitazone (77.5 +/- 28.6 to 75.3 +/- 33.1 units). Both systolic blood pressure (137.4 +/- 15.6 vs. 128.8 +/- 14.8 mmHg, baseline vs. week 32, P < 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (87.2 +/- 9.4 vs. 79.4 +/- 7.2 mmHg, P < 0.0001) improved in the group treated with rosiglitazone. The total incidence of hypoglycemia did not differ between groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRosiglitazone in combination with insulin resulted in improved glycemic control and blood pressure without an increase in insulin requirements, compared with insulin- and placebo-treated subjects, whose improved glycemic control required an 11% increase in insulin dose. Weight gain and hypoglycemia were similar in both groups at the end of the study. The greatest effect of rosiglitazone occurred in subjects with more pronounced markers of insulin resistance.",

            "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) activation up-regulates thermogenesis-related genes in rodent white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) without increasing whole-body energy expenditure. We tested here whether such dissociation is the result of a negative modulation of sympathetic activity to WAT and BAT and thyroid axis components by PPARgamma activation. Administration of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (15 mg/kg.d) for 7 d to male Sprague Dawley rats increased food intake (10%), feed efficiency (31%), weight gain (45%), spontaneous motor activity (60%), and BAT and WAT mass and reduced whole-body oxygen consumption. Consistent with an anabolic setting, rosiglitazone markedly reduced sympathetic activity to BAT and WAT (>50%) and thyroid status as evidenced by reduced levels of plasma thyroid hormones (T(4) and T(3)) and mRNA levels of BAT and liver T(3)-generating enzymes iodothyronine type 2 (-40%) and type 1 (-32%) deiodinases, respectively. Rosiglitazone also decreased mRNA levels of the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) isoforms alpha1 (-34%) and beta (-66%) in BAT and isoforms alpha1 (-20%) and alpha2 (-47%) in retroperitoneal WAT. These metabolic effects were associated with a reduction in mRNA levels of the pro-energy expenditure peptides CRH and CART in specific hypothalamic nuclei. A direct central action of rosiglitazone is, however, unlikely based on its low brain uptake and lack of metabolic effects of intracerebroventricular administration. In conclusion, a reduction in BAT sympathetic activity and thyroid status appears to, at least partly, explain the PPARgamma-induced reduction in energy expenditure and the fact that up-regulation of thermogenic gene expression does not translate into functional stimulation of whole-body thermogenesis in vivo.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the mechanisms whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonism affects glucose and lipid metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by studying the impact of PPARgamma activation on BAT glucose uptake and metabolism, lipogenesis, and mRNA levels plus activities of enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. Interscapular BAT of rats treated or not with rosiglitazone (15 mg*kg(-1).day(-1), 7 days) was evaluated in vivo for glucose uptake and lipogenesis and in vitro for glucose metabolism, gene expression, and activities of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (PAP or lipin-1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Rosiglitazone increased BAT mass without affecting whole tissue glucose uptake. BAT glycogen content (-80%), its synthesis from glucose (-50%), and mRNA levels of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (-40%), which generates UDP-linked glucose for glycogen synthesis, were all reduced by rosiglitazone. In contrast, BAT TAG-glycerol synthesis in vivo and glucose incorporation into TAG-glycerol in vitro were stimulated by the agonist along with the activities and mRNA levels of glycerol 3-phosphate-generating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycerokinase. Furthermore, rosiglitazone markedly increased the activities of GPAT and DGAT but not those of lipin-1-mediated PAP-1, enzymes involved in the sequential acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate and TAG synthesis. Because an adequate supply of fatty acids is essential for BAT nonshivering thermogenesis, the enhanced ability of BAT to synthesize TAG under PPARgamma activation may constitute an important mechanism by which lipid substrates are stored in preparation for an eventual thermogenic activation.",

Innervated and surgically denervated BAT pads of rats treated or not with rosiglitazone (15 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), 7 days) were evaluated for weight, triacylglycerol (TAG) and DNA content, mitochondrial mass, and gene expression. Rosiglitazone induced BAT recruitment (increased mass, TAG and DNA content) and mRNA levels of lipolytic (adipose tissue triglyceride lipase and CGI58) and lipogenic (lipoprotein lipase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid binding protein 4, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1) proteins independently of tissue innervation status. Mitochondrial mass and mRNA levels of its regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-alpha and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta were not affected by rosiglitazone, while being significantly reduced by denervation. By contrast, maximal stimulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (thermogenesis), cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-45-like effector A (inhibitor of UCP1 activity), monoacylglycerol lipase (lipolysis), small heterodimer partner (transcription), and glycerokinase (TAG synthesis) by rosiglitazone depended on the presence of intact BAT innervation. Cold exposure (5 degrees C, 24 h) significantly increased UCP1 mRNA levels in innervated BAT pads of untreated rats, without affecting the already high BAT UCP1 levels of rosiglitazone-treated animals. A similar pattern of response was found in denervated pads, but with markedly lower UCP1 expression than that in innervated BAT. In conclusion, whereas the mass (hyperplasia and hypertrophy), lipogenic, and lipolytic components of BAT recruitment induced by rosiglitazone occur independently of tissue sympathetic innervation, maximal UCP1 expression induced by PPAR-gamma in vivo depends on the presence of basal BAT adrenergic tone. The residual sympathetic tone found under rosiglitazone treatment is, therefore, involved in the modulation of a subset of major components of PPAR-gamma-mediated BAT recruitment.",

Sprague-Dawley rats treated or not with the PPAR\u03b3 ligand rosiglitazone (15 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1), 7 days) were kept at 23\u00b0C or exposed to cold (5\u00b0C) for 24 h and evaluated for BAT gene expression, sympathetic activity, thyroid status, and adrenergic signaling. Rosiglitazone did not affect the reduction in body weight gain and the increase in feed efficiency, Vo(2), and BAT sympathetic activity induced by 24-h cold exposure. Rosiglitazone strongly attenuated the increase in serum total and free T4 and T3 levels and BAT iodothyronine deiodinase type 2 (D2) and PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels and potentiated the reduction in BAT thyroid hormone receptor (THR) \u03b2 mRNA levels induced by cold. Administration of T3 to rosiglitazone-treated rats exacerbated the cold-induced increase in energy expenditure but did not restore a proper activation of D2 and PGC-1\u03b1, nor further increased uncoupling protein 1 expression. Regarding adrenergic signaling, rosiglitazone did not affect the changes in BAT cAMP content and PKA activity induced by cold. Rosiglitazone alone or in combination with cold increased CREB binding to DNA, but it markedly reduced the expression of one of its major coactivators, CREB binding protein. In conclusion, pharmacological PPAR\u03b3 activation impairs short-term cold elicitation of BAT adrenergic and thyroid signaling, which may result in abnormal tissue recruitment and thermogenic activity.",

            "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue contributes importantly to homeothermy and energy balance in rodents due its ability under demand to produce heat through a process denominated nonshivering thermogenesis. Such thermogenic ability of brown adipocytes relies on the activity of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 that, when properly activated, dissipates energy from oxidative metabolism as heat. Brown adipose tissue sympathetic innervation through norepinephrine release not only induces brown adipocyte lipolysis and thermogenesis, but also acts as the major determinant of tissue mass, cellularity and mitochondrial content. Several pieces of evidence gathered over the years indicate that, in addition to tissue sympathetic innervation, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 plays an important role in regulating the development, metabolism and thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue. Herein we review the main evidence supporting such key role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 to brown fat biology and discuss the future directions of this important area of research.",

However, as nutritionists move towards this goal, they will probably need to account for the fact that resting metabolic rate is not as static as it was once presumed. Intra-subject variability in resting metabolic rate is often attributed to physiological regulation, but the dynamics and the mechanisms of this regulation are still under investigation. New insights into this topic can be found in several of the articles published in Temperature. Daanen and Van Marken Lichtenbelt discuss the contribution of nonshivering thermogenesis to the metabolic rate of adult humans. Until recently, nonshivering thermogenesis was thought to be an exclusive feature of subjects that have a well-defined depot of brown fat, such as small mammals and newborn humans. However, this view started to change when brown adipocytes were found scatted in the supraclavicular white fat of adult humans. The available evidence indicates that, in adult humans, nonshivering thermogenesis is activated before shivering in response to mild cold, and can account for an increase of 10\u201320% in metabolic rate. This contribution may vary depending on genetic background and environmental factors. The influence of the environment might be related to adipocyte browning, the process by which white adipocytes can be transformed into thermogenic brown adipocytes. A protein known as \u2018PR domain zinc finger protein 16\u2019 (Prdm16) has been shown to play a major role in this process, being capable of activating the full genetic program of thermogenic brown adipocytes. Brown adipocyte differentiation also seems to be under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPAR-g). Of particular relevance to nutritional sciences is the increasing body of evidence indicating that nonshivering thermogenesis can be governed by non-thermal factors, including metabolic signals. Motivated by the potential use of vagal nerve stimulation as a treatment for obesity, Madden et al. investigated how non-thermal sensory fibers of the vagus nerve can modulate nonshivering thermogenesis in experimental rats. The results revealed that vagal afferents suppress brown fat activity via a neural reflex involving glutamatergic activation of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract and subsequent GABAergic inhibition of sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral raphe pallidus. Mohammed et al. have also shown the importance of non-thermal signals in the control of brown fat thermogenesis in rats, but, in that case, a cross-talk was found between fasting-stimulated orexigenic neurons and brown fat. In another study, Miko et al. have described alarin as an atypical orexigenic peptide: whereas typical orexigenic peptides increase appetite and suppress metabolic rate, alarin increases both appetite and metabolic rate. Drugs are also non-thermal factors of relevance in assessments of resting metabolic rate, and, in this context, amphetamines deserve attention. To make matters even more interesting, it has been recently discovered that nonshivering thermogenesis displays an ultradian rhythmicity that may be independent of sensory inputs. This topic is covered in an authoritative review by Blessing and Ootsuka, which presents a fresh approach for studying integrative physiology, in addition to providing a historical account of the authors\u2019 discovery. Such an approach consists of analyzing physiological data at the individual level, as opposed to the more conventional analysis of group averages. Using this approach, the authors discovered that the brown fat temperature of unanesthetized rats increases suddenly, for no apparent reason, every 1\u20132 hours in both the light and dark phases of the day.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT White adipose tissue (WAT) thermogenic activity may play a role in whole-body energy balance and two of its main regulators are thought to be environmental temperature (Tenv) and exercise. Low Tenv may increase uncoupling protein one (UCP1; the main biomarker of thermogenic activity) in WAT to regulate body temperature. On the other hand, exercise may stimulate UCP1 in WAT, which is thought to alter body weight regulation. However, our understanding of the roles (if any) of Tenv and exercise in WAT thermogenic activity remains incomplete. Our aim was to examine the impacts of low Tenv and exercise on WAT thermogenic activity, which may alter energy homeostasis and body weight regulation. We conducted a series of four experimental studies, supported by two systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We found increased UCP1 mRNA (p = 0.03; but not protein level) in human WAT biopsy samples collected during the cold part of the year, a finding supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO review protocol: CRD42019120116). Additional clinical trials (NCT04037371; NCT04037410) using Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) revealed no impact of low Tenv on human WAT thermogenic activity (p > 0.05). Furthermore, we found no effects of exercise on UCP1 mRNA or protein levels (p > 0.05) in WAT biopsy samples from a human randomized controlled trial (Clinical trial: NCT04039685), a finding supported by systematic review and meta-analytic data (PROSPERO review protocol: CRD42019120213). Taken together, the present experimental and meta-analytic findings of UCP1 and SUVmax, demonstrate that cold and exercise may play insignificant roles in human WAT thermogenic activity.

            "abstract": "The crosstalk between the exercising muscle and the adipose tissue, mediated by myokines and metabolites, derived from both tissues during exercise has created a controversy between animal and human studies with respect to the impact of exercise on the browning process. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-culturing of C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes under the stimuli of electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) mimicking muscle contraction can impact the expression of UCP1, PGC-1a, and IL-6 in adipocytes, therefore providing evidence on the direct crosstalk between adipocytes and stimulated muscle cells. In the co-cultured C2C12 cells, EPS increased the expression of PGC-1a (p = 0.129; d = 0.73) and IL-6 (p = 0.09; d = 1.13) protein levels. When EPS was applied, we found that co-culturing led to increases in UCP1 (p = 0.044; d = 1.29) and IL-6 (p = 0.097; d = 1.13) protein expression in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The expression of PGC-1a increased by EPS but was not significantly elevated after co-culturing (p = 0.448; d = 0.08). In vitro co-culturing of C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes under the stimuli of EPS leads to increased expression of thermogenic proteins. These findings indicate changes in the expression pattern of proteins related to browning of adipose tissue, supporting the use of this in vitro model to study the crosstalk between adipocytes and contracting muscle.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism of white adipose tissue browning is not well understood; however, naturally occurring compounds are known to play a positive role. The effects of cucurbitacins B, E, and I on the browning of mature white adipocytes were investigated. First, the cell viability exhibited by cucurbitacins B, E, and I in pre- and mature adipocytes was verified. Cucurbitacins B, E, and I had no effect on cell viability in pre- and mature adipocytes at concentrations up to 300 nM. To investigate the characteristics of representative beige adipocytes, the formation and morphology of cucurbitacin B, E, and I lipid droplets were verified. The total lipid droplet surface area, maximum Feret diameter, and total Nile red staining intensity of cucurbitacin B-, E-, and I-treated adipocytes were lower than those of mature white adipocytes. Furthermore, treatment of white mature adipocytes with cucurbitacin B, E, and I led to the formation of several small lipid droplets that are readily available for energy expenditure. We evaluated the effect of cucurbitacins B, E, and I on the expression of representative browning markers UCP1, PGC1a, and PRDM16, which participate in the browning of white adipose tissue. Cucurbitacins B, E, and I increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of UCP1, PGC1a, and PRDM16 in a concentration-dependent manner. To promote energy consumption by beige adipocytes, active mitochondrial biogenesis is essential. Next, we investigated the effects of cucurbitacin B, E, and I on mitochondrial biogenesis in mature adipocytes. Mitochondrial mass increased when mature adipocytes were treated with cucurbitacin B, E, and I. The degree of cucurbitacin B-, E- and I-induced transformation of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes was in the order of Cu E > Cu B > Cu I. To verify the effect of phospholipase D2 on the browning of white adipocytes, CAY10594\u2014a PLD2 pharmacological inhibitor, and a knockdown system were used. PLD2 inhibition and knockdown improved the expression levels of UCP1, PGC1a, and PRDM16. In addition, PLD2 inhibition and knockdown in mature white adipocytes promoted mitochondrial biosynthesis. The effect of PLD2 inhibition and knockdown on promoting browning of white adipocytes significantly increased when Cu B, Cu E, and Cu I were co-treated. These data indicate that mature white adipocytes\u2019 beige properties were induced by cucurbitacins B, E, and I. These effects became more potent by the inhibition of PLD2. These findings provide a model for determining anti-obesity agents that induce browning and increase energy expenditure in mature white adipocytes.",
