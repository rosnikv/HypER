            "abstract": "For decades sulphasalazine has been the only valuable non-corticosteroid drug in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Then Truelove et al showed that the pharmacologically active moiety in sulphasalazine for the treatment of this disease was 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).' This resulted in new 5-ASA formulations for topical and oral use. 5-ASA enemas and suppositories seem to have the same efficacy as topical corticosteroids in active distal ulcerative colitis.2 3 Sulphasalazine is not as effective as corticosteroids for the treatment of widespread active disease, and there is no evidence that any of the newer salicylates is better in this respect.4 Because extensive, active ulcerative colitis must be treated aggressively so that it does not become severe and require surgery, systemic corticosteroids are always the first alternative in these cases. Maintenance treatment is therefore the main indication for oral use of sulphasalazine and the new salicylates in ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis was unable to show that any of the new salicylates was more efficient than sulphasalazine.4 There are three factors to consider when choosing which drug to use: (1) effectiveness; (2) which formulation delivers 5-ASA to the colon with the fewest systemic effects; and (3) safety. The formulations and sites of 5-ASA release of various new 5-ASA based drugs are shown in the Table.",

Fresh endoscopic biopsies of the recto\u2013sigmoid region were obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy from 10 patients suffering an acute attack of UC and a similar number of healthy controls. Quantitative estimation was carried out on selective media for total aerobic, anaerobic, Bacteroides , Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. (Miles\u2013Misra). Species identification involved gram stain, indole, catalase tests and commercially validated anaerobic, gram-positive and non-enteric fermenting enzyme hydrolysis kits. There was a significant quantitative decrease in growth of Lactobacillus spp. in colitic biopsies (p<0.05). Total aerobic speciation revealed 32 different sub-species with 18 of these found only in UC biopsies. Anaerobic speciation revealed 41 different sub-species with a mean 6.7 species in normal and 4.7 in UC patients. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was isolated in significantly increased frequency in UC biopsies (8:10) in comparison with normal (4:10). Our data are consistent with the possibility that a reduction in mucosally associated Lactobacillus bacteria in UC permits proliferation of a large number of potentially pathogenic aerobic species and anaerobic predominance of B. thetaiotaomicron .

In this study we investigated the potential of GG to reduce AFB1 availability in vitro in Caco-2 cells adapted to express cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, such that both transport and toxicity could be assessed. Caco-2 cells were grown as confluent monolayers on transmembrane filters for 21 days prior to all studies. AFB1 levels in culture medium were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. In CYP 3A4-induced monolayers, AFB1 transport from the apical to the basolateral chamber was reduced from 11.1% \u00b1 1.9% to 6.4% \u00b1 2.5% (P = 0.019) and to 3.3% \u00b1 1.8% (P = 0.002) within the first hour in monolayers coincubated with GG (1 \u00d7 1010 and 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml, respectively).

AFB1 caused significant reductions of 30.1% (P = 0.01), 49.4% (P = 0.004), and 64.4% (P < 0.001) in transepithelial resistance after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Coincubation with 1 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml GG after 24 h protected against AFB1-induced reductions in transepithelial resistance at both 24 h (P = 0.002) and 48 h (P = 0.04). DNA fragmentation was apparent in cells treated only with AFB1 cells but not in cells coincubated with either 1 \u00d7 1010 or 5 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml GG.

            "abstract": "Interest in the bacterial protective effect against mycotoxins has greatly increased. This effect is mostly strain-dependent and the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. The objectives of this work were (1) to assess the ability of Lactobacillus casei Shirota to bind aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by fluorescent monoclonal antibody staining, (2) to evaluate the AFB1-bacteria interaction by atomic force microscopy, and (3) to determine its effect on intestinal absorption through detection of AFB1-Lys adducts used as biological markers to a 3-week aflatoxin exposure in a murine model. The micrographs obtained in this work showed for the first time a clear visual image of the ability of Lactobacillus casei Shirota to bind AFB1 into the bacterial cell envelope. The images also revealed that aflatoxin binding produces structural changes that modify the bacterial cell surface. AFB1-Lys adducts quantified from blood samples were found to be present at significantly lower levels in animals receiving AFB1 plus bacteria than in those receiving only AFB1. This suggests that the presence of Lactobacillus casei Shirota can decrease aflatoxin absorption at the intestinal level even after a long period of toxin exposure, which consequently circumvents its toxic effects.Abstract(1) Lactobacillus casei Shirota B1 (AFB1) (2) AFB1-(3) 3 AFB1-Lys Lactobacillus casei Shirota AFB1 AFB1-Lys AFB1-Lys Lactobacillus casei ShirotaR\u00e9sum\u00e9L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet protecteur des bact\u00e9ries contre les mycotoxines a consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9. Cet effet est majoritairement souche-d\u00e9pendant et les m\u00e9canismes impliqu\u00e9s ne sont pas encore bien expliqu\u00e9s. Les objectifs de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9taient (1) d\u2019estimer la capacit\u00e9 de la souche Shirota de Lactobacillus casei de lier l\u2019aflatoxine B1 (AFB1) par marquage \u00e0 un anticorps monoclonal fluorescent, (2) d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019interaction bact\u00e9rie-AFB1 par microscopie \u00e0 force atomique, (3) de d\u00e9terminer ses effets sur l\u2019absorption intestinale par la d\u00e9tection des compos\u00e9s AFB1-Lys utilis\u00e9s comme marqueurs biologiques apr\u00e8s exposition de 3 semaines en mod\u00e8le de souris. Les micrographies obtenues dans cette \u00e9tude montraient pour la premi\u00e8re fois une repr\u00e9sentation visuelle claire de la capacit\u00e9 de Lactobacillus casei Shirota \u00e0 lier AFB1 au sein de l\u2019enveloppe de la cellule bact\u00e9rienne. Les images montraient \u00e9galement que la liaison de l\u2019aflatoxine produit des changements structuraux qui modifient la surface de la cellule bact\u00e9rienne. Les compos\u00e9s AFB1-Lys quantifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir des \u00e9chantillons sanguins \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 des niveaux significativement plus faibles chez les animaux recevant AFB1 plus bact\u00e9rie par rapport \u00e0 ceux recevant seulement AFB1. Ceci sugg\u00e8re que la pr\u00e9sence de Lactobacillus casei Shirota peut diminuer l\u2019absorption de l\u2019aflatoxine au niveau intestinal m\u00eame apr\u00e8s une longue p\u00e9riode d\u2019exposition \u00e0 la toxine, ce qui limite consid\u00e9rablement ses effets toxiques.",

The probiotic characteristic assays of LAB consisted of resistance to acidic conditions (pH 3), gastric juice and bile salts 0.3%. We also carried out an in vitro evaluation of LAB aflatoxin binding ability in viable and non-viable cell for 24 and 48 hours of incubation. The measurement of aflatoxin content was performed by ELISA method using AgraQuant Total Aflatoxin Assay kit. The results showed that all isolates were potential as probiotics and the G7 isolate had the highest viability among other isolates in pH 3 (92.61 %) and the bile salts assay (97.71 %). The percentage of aflatoxin reduction between viable and non-viable cell from each LAB isolate were different. The highest aflatoxin reduction in viable cell assay was performed by G7 isolate (69.11 %) whereas in non-viable cell assay was performed by PDS3 isolate (73.75 %) during incubation time 48 hours. In this study, G7 isolate performed the best probiotic characteristics with the highest viability in acid pH assay, bile salt 0.3% assay and percentage of aflatoxin B1 reduction in viable cell condition. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that G7 isolate had homology with Lactobacillus plantarum (99.9%).

This in vivo study used a general and comprehensive approach for characterizing the hindgut ecosystem of 9 healthy horses over 28 days in response to a 5-day challenge with oral trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (TMS), with a special emphasis on microbial fibrolytic activity and the host immune response. Horses were supplemented with two doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Ligilactobacillus salivarius (formerly L. salivarius), and Bifidobacterium lactis blend or a placebo in a 3 \u00d7 3 Latin square design. Changes in fecal microbiota were investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clostridioides difficile was quantified in feces using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Anaerobic microbiological culture was used to enumerate functional bacterial groups (cellulolytic, amylolytic, and lactic acid-utilizing). The environmental dimensions were assessed by measuring the concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and lactic acid using biochemical methods, and changes in pH and dry matter weight. Systemic and local inflammation was evaluated by determination of cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)A concentrations in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) concentrations in the feces using immuno-enzymatic methods. Oral TMS treatment strongly altered the whole hindgut ecosystem by 2 days after the first administration. Bacterial diversity decreased in proportion to the relative abundance of fibrolytic genera, which coincided with the decrease in the concentration of cellulolytic bacteria. At the same time, the composition of microbiota members was reorganized in terms of relative abundances, probably to support the alteration in fibrolysis. C. difficile DNA was not found in these horses, but the relative abundances of several potential pathobiont genera increased. 2 days after the first TMS administration, fecal concentrations of VFAs and SIgA increased in parallel with fecal water content, suggesting an alteration of the integrity of the hindgut mucosa. Recovery in bacterial composition, functions, and immune biomarkers took 2\u20139 days after the end of TMS administration. Supplementation with this bacterial blend did not limit bacterial alteration but might have interesting mucosal immunomodulatory effects.",

However, both papers share a common interest in the use of probiotics (Lactobacillus) to modulate the gut microbiota. Therefore, the key hypothesis in this paper is partially dependent on the general concept of probiotics' effects on gut microbiota, but not directly dependent on the findings of the source paper."

            "abstract": "The equine hindgut ecosystem is specialized in dietary fibers\u2019 fermentation to provide horses\u2019 energy and contribute to its health.
