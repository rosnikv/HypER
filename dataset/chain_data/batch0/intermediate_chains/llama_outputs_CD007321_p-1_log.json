            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe evaluated the effectiveness and rapidity of onset of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), administered as daily intravenous boluses of 400 mg for 5 days, followed by oral tablets, 200 mg thrice daily for 23 days, versus a matching placebo regimen, in the treatment of 81 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was bicentric, randomized, double blinded, and placebo controlled. Patients underwent a 7-day washout of arthritis medications prior to initiation of this study treatment. Major outcome measures were the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability and pain scales, and supplemental visual analog scales for rest and walking pain.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt one site, patients had milder OA, the baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were well matched, and the SAM treated group showed significantly greater reduction in overall pain and rest pain (p < 0.05) than the placebo treated group. At the other site, the patients had more severe OA, randomization yielded markedly different treatment groups, and the response to treatment did not differ between groups. Onset of SAM effect was seen as early as 14 days after the start of treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSAM may be an effective treatment for some patients with symptomatic knee OA, and merits further study. Intravenous loading before oral maintenance therapy may be advantageous.",

Less is known about their direct effects on articular cartilage. Chondrocytes isolated from mature Holstein cows were cultured in alginate beads, as monolayers or as explants, and examined for evidence of synergistic activity in metabolic responses that would indicate a beneficial effect in preserving the integrity of articular cartilage. SAMe alone stimulated uptake of radiolabeled sulfate into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) at 0.052 \u00b5g/mL (+15%), increasing to 50% at 10.0 \u00b5g/mL, the highest dose tested.

This study determined plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics after oral CBD oil suspension administration in Hartley guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), which spontaneously develop OA at 3\u00a0months of age. Ten, 5-month-old, male guinea pigs were randomly assigned to receive 25 (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or 50\u00a0mg/kg (n\u00a0=\u00a05) CBD oil once orally. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u00a0h timepoints. Open-field enclosure monitoring revealed no adverse effects. After euthanasia, stifle cartilage and infrapatellar fat pads were collected to quantitate CBD. CBD concentrations were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve was 379.5 and 873.7\u00a0h*ng/mL, maximum plasma concentration was 42 and 96.8\u00a0ng/mL, time to maximum plasma concentration was 1.6 and 4.8\u00a0h, and terminal phase half-life was 8.1 and 10.8\u00a0h for the 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg doses, respectively.

            "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) has gained widespread popularity as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) in pets; however, there is minimal scientific evidence regarding safe and effective dosing. This study determined plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics after oral CBD oil suspension administration in Hartley guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), which spontaneously develop OA at 3\u00a0months of age. Ten, 5-month-old, male guinea pigs were randomly assigned to receive 25 (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or 50\u00a0mg/kg (n\u00a0=\u00a05) CBD oil once orally. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u00a0h timepoints. Open-field enclosure monitoring revealed no adverse effects. After euthanasia, stifle cartilage and infrapatellar fat pads were collected to quantitate CBD. CBD concentrations were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve was 379.5 and 873.7\u00a0h*ng/mL, maximum plasma concentration was 42 and 96.8\u00a0ng/mL, time to maximum plasma concentration was 1.6 and 4.8\u00a0h, and terminal phase half-life was 8.1 and 10.8\u00a0h for the 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg doses, respectively. CBD was detected in joint tissues of all animals. Further studies, including work in female guinea pigs, are needed to determine the efficacy of CBD for OA.",

            "abstract": "The goal of pharmacokinetic (PK) studies is to provide a basis for appropriate dosing regimens with novel therapeutic agents. With a knowledge of the desired serum concentration for optimum pharmacological effect, the amount and rate of drug administration can be tailored to maintain that concentration based on the 24-hour PK modeling (eg, every 24 hours, every 12 hours) to achieve therapeutic ranges. This dosing and PK information are tailored to maintain that concentration. Typically, these optimum serum concentrations pertain across species. Single-dose PK modeling provides fundamental parameters to suggest dosing regimes. Multiple-dose PK studies provide information on steady-state serum levels to assure that desired therapeutic levels are maintained during chronic administration. Clinical trials using dosing suggested by these PK determinations provide proof that the compound is producing the desired therapeutic effect. A number of PK studies with cannabinoids in humans and domestic animals have been conducted with the goal of determining appropriate clinical use with these plant-derived products. The following review will focus on the PK of cannabidiol (CBD) and the lesser-known precursor of CBD, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). Although \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has profound pharmacological effects and may be present at variable and potentially violative concentrations in hemp products, PK studies with THC will not be a major consideration. Because, in domestic animals, hemp-CBD products are usually administered orally, that route will be a focus. When available, PK results with CBD administered by other routes will be summarized. In addition, the metabolism of CBD across species appears to be different in carnivorous species compared with omnivorous/herbivorous species (including humans) based on current information, and the preliminary information related to this will be explained with the therapeutic implication being addressed in Currents in One Health by Ukai et al, JAVMA, May 2023.",
