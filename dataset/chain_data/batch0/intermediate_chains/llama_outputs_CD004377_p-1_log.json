This repeated measures study of induced ischaemic pain compared reports of pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain endurance under three conditions: control, placebo interferential, and placebo TENS. Both of the placebo conditions significantly delayed the report of pain threshold. Placebo interferential also delayed pain tolerance. Each placebo condition reduced pain intensity in the 6th minute. Only placebo TENS reduced pain at the 9th minute of ischaemic pain. The nature of pain reduction in the placebo conditions suggests that analgesia was due to learned expectancies and endogenous opioid release. Further research into the impact of positive expectancies of pain relief in our patients could clarify the efficacy of physiotherapy outcomes for pain.",
