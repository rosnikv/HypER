The ABCD2 tool was proposed as a method to triage these patients using five clinical factors. Modern imaging of the brain was not included. The present study quantified the added value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors to the ABCD2 tool. Methods Patients with TIA or minor stroke were examined within 12 h and had a brain MRI within 24 h of symptom onset. Primary outcomes were recurrent stroke and functional impairment at 90 days. A new tool, ABCD2+ MRI, was created by adding diffusion-weighted imaging lesion and vessel occlusion status to the ABCD2 tool. The predictive accuracy of both tools was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Results One hundred and eighty patients were enrolled and 11\u00b71% had a recurrent stroke within 90 days. The predictive accuracy of the ABCD2+MRI was significantly higher than ABCD2 (AUC of 0\u00b788 vs. 0\u00b778, P = 0\u00b701). Those with a high score (7\u20139) had a 90-day recurrent stroke risk of 32\u00b71%, moderate score (5\u20136) risk of 5\u00b74%, and low score (0-4) risk of 0\u00b70%. The ABCD2 tool did not predict risk of functional impairment at 90 days (P = 0\u00b733), unlike the ABCD2+MRI (P = 0\u00b702): high score (22\u00b79%), moderate (7\u00b75%), low (7\u00b77%).

            "abstract": "Background Risk of a subsequent stroke following an acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke is high. The ABCD2 tool was proposed as a method to triage these patients using five clinical factors. Modern imaging of the brain was not included. The present study quantified the added value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) factors to the ABCD2 tool. Methods Patients with TIA or minor stroke were examined within 12 h and had a brain MRI within 24 h of symptom onset. Primary outcomes were recurrent stroke and functional impairment at 90 days. A new tool, ABCD2+ MRI, was created by adding diffusion-weighted imaging lesion and vessel occlusion status to the ABCD2 tool. The predictive accuracy of both tools was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Results One hundred and eighty patients were enrolled and 11\u00b71% had a recurrent stroke within 90 days. The predictive accuracy of the ABCD2+MRI was significantly higher than ABCD2 (AUC of 0\u00b788 vs. 0\u00b778, P = 0\u00b701). Those with a high score (7\u20139) had a 90-day recurrent stroke risk of 32\u00b71%, moderate score (5\u20136) risk of 5\u00b74%, and low score (0-4) risk of 0\u00b70%. The ABCD2 tool did not predict risk of functional impairment at 90 days (P = 0\u00b733), unlike the ABCD2+MRI (P = 0\u00b702): high score (22\u00b79%), moderate (7\u00b75%), low (7\u00b77%). Conclusions Risk of recurrent stroke and functional impairment after a TIA or minor stroke can be accurately predicted by a scoring system that utilizes both clinical and MRI information. The ABCD2+MRI score is simple and its components are commonly available during the time of admission.",

            "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 Statins reduce stroke risk when initiated months after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke and reduce early vascular events in acute coronary syndromes, possibly via pleiotropic plaque stabilization. Few data exist on acute statin use in TIA. We aimed to determine whether statin pretreatment at TIA onset modified early stroke risk in carotid stenosis. Methods\u2014 We analyzed data from 2770 patients with TIA from 11 centers, 387 with ipsilateral carotid stenosis. ABCD2 score, abnormal diffusion weighted imaging, medication pretreatment, and early stroke were recorded. Results\u2014 In patients with carotid stenosis, 7-day stroke risk was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7\u201311.1) compared with 2.7% (CI, 2.0%\u20133.4%) without stenosis (P<0.0001; 90-day risks 17.8% and 5.7% [P<0.0001]). Among carotid stenosis patients, nonprocedural 7-day stroke risk was 3.8% (CI, 1.2%\u20139.7%) with statin treatment at TIA onset, compared with 13.2% (CI, 8.5%\u201319.8%) in those not statin pretreated (P=0.01; 90-day risks 8.9% versus 20.8% [P=0.01]). Statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk in patients with carotid stenosis (odds ratio for 90-day stroke, 0.37; CI, 0.17\u20130.82) but not nonstenosis patients (odds ratio, 1.3; CI, 0.8\u20132.24; P for interaction, 0.008). On multivariable logistic regression, the association remained after adjustment for ABCD2 score, smoking, antiplatelet treatment, recent TIA, and diffusion weighted imaging hyperintensity (adjusted P for interaction, 0.054). Conclusions\u2014 In acute symptomatic carotid stenosis, statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk, consistent with findings from randomized trials in acute coronary syndromes. These data support the hypothesis that statins started acutely after TIA symptom onset may also be beneficial to prevent early stroke. Randomized trials addressing this question are required.",

            "abstract": "Background and Purpose\u2014 Statins reduce stroke risk when initiated months after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke and reduce early vascular events in acute coronary syndromes, possibly via pleiotropic plaque stabilization. Few data exist on acute statin use in TIA. We aimed to determine whether statin pretreatment at TIA onset modified early stroke risk in carotid stenosis. Methods\u2014 We analyzed data from 2770 patients with TIA from 11 centers, 387 with ipsilateral carotid stenosis. ABCD2 score, abnormal diffusion weighted imaging, medication pretreatment, and early stroke were recorded. Results\u2014 In patients with carotid stenosis, 7-day stroke risk was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7\u201311.1) compared with 2.7% (CI, 2.0%\u20133.4%) without stenosis (P<0.0001; 90-day risks 17.8% and 5.7% [P<0.0001]). Among carotid stenosis patients, nonprocedural 7-day stroke risk was 3.8% (CI, 1.2%\u20139.7%) with statin treatment at TIA onset, compared with 13.2% (CI, 8.5%\u201319.8%) in those not statin pretreated (P=0.01; 90-day risks 8.9% versus 20.8% [P=0.01]). Statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk in patients with carotid stenosis (odds ratio for 90-day stroke, 0.37; CI, 0.17\u20130.82) but not nonstenosis patients (odds ratio, 1.3; CI, 0.8\u20132.24; P for interaction, 0.008). On multivariable logistic regression, the association remained after adjustment for ABCD2 score, smoking, antiplatelet treatment, recent TIA, and diffusion weighted imaging hyperintensity (adjusted P for interaction, 0.054). Conclusions\u2014 In acute symptomatic carotid stenosis, statin pretreatment was associated with reduced stroke risk, consistent with findings from randomized trials in acute coronary syndromes. These data support the hypothesis that statins started acutely after TIA symptom onset may also be beneficial to prevent early stroke. Randomized trials addressing this question are required.",

The source paper evaluates a novel emergency department-based TIA triage system, and this paper explores a new aspect (statin treatment) of TIA management, which is partially dependent on the previous findings regarding TIA management."
