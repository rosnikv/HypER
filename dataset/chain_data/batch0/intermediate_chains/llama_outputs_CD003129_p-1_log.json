            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can persist through adolescence and adulthood, resulting in significant disability. The use of low-dose oral methotrexate (MTX) for persistent polyarthritis has been shown to be effective by the USA/USSR collaborative study group. However, 2 of the most disabling subgroups of JIA, systemic and extended oligoarthritis, were underrepresented in that study. The present study was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of MTX in these 2 subgroups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients under the age of 16 years who fulfilled the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria for systemic or extended oligoarticular arthritis were eligible for this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Forty-five patients with systemic and 43 with extended oligoarticular arthritis were enrolled. The dosage of MTX or placebo was 15 mg/m2, which could be increased to 20 mg/m2 after 2 months. Core outcome variables were considered as primary measures, giving a final score of \"improved\" or \"not improved.\" Secondary measures included scores of systemic features and biochemical laboratory measures. Assessment of function was not included since there were no validated functional measures at the start of this trial in 1991.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the extended oligoarticular arthritis group, MTX treatment produced significant improvement in 3 of 5 core variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, physician's global assessment of disease activity, and parent's global assessment of disease activity). By the primary improvement criteria, there was significant overall improvement during MTX treatment. In the systemic arthritis group, only 2 of 5 core variables were significantly improved (physician's and parent's global assessment of disease activity). Systemic features were not part of the core variables, but the systemic feature score was not significantly different between MTX and placebo treatment. There was no significant overall improvement in this group during MTX treatment. However, no significant interaction between disease subgroup and treatment effect was demonstrated. When the data from both disease subgroups were combined, there was significant clinical improvement during MTX treatment (P = 0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMTX 15-20 mg/m2 given orally once a week was found to be an effective treatment for both extended oligoarticular and systemic JIA in this shortterm trial. Long-term efficacy needs to be addressed in future studies.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nKawasaki disease (kDa) is an immune-mediated vasculitis of childhood with multi-organ inflammation. We determined the risk of subsequent immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), including arthritis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune liver disease (ALD), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a matched population-based cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Children aged <18\u2009years born between 1991-2016 diagnosed with kDa (n\u2009=\u20093,753) were matched to 5 non-kDa controls from the general population (n\u2009=\u200918\u2009749). We determined the incidence of IMIDs after resolution of kDa. Three- and 12-month washout periods were used to exclude kDa-related symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was an elevated risk of arthritis in kDa patients compared with non-kDa controls starting three months after index date (103.0 vs 12.7 per 100\u2009000 person-years (PYs); incidence rate ratio (IRR) 8.07 (95% CI 4.95-13.2); hazard ratio (HR) 8.08 (95% CI 4.95-13.2), resulting in the overall incidence of IMIDs being elevated in kDa patients (175.1 vs 68.0 per 100\u2009000 PYs; IRR 2.58 (95% CI 1.93-3.43); HR 2.58, 95% CI 1.94-3.43). However, there was no increased risk for diabetes, IBD, ALD, PSC or MS in kDa patients. Similar results were observed using a 12-month washout period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren diagnosed with kDa were at increased risk of arthritis following the acute kDa event, but not other IMIDs. Health care providers should monitor for arthritis in children following a diagnosis of kDa.",

            "abstract": "Objectives Recent research has demonstrated the commonality of several biological markers between Kawasaki disease (KD) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), including interleukin-1\u03b2 and -6. Therefore, in this cohort study, we assessed whether KD increases the risk of JIA. Methods This study enrolled 7009 patients with and 56 072 individuals without KD in the period 2010\u20132018 from Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. On the basis of sex, age, and comorbidities, we executed propensity score matching at the ratio 1:8. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for JIA was determined through multiple Cox regression. Stratified analysis and sensitivity tests were also employed. Results When adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the JIA risk was noted to be 2.02-fold greater in children with KD than it was in those without (aHR: 2.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.12\u20133.67, p = 0.0205). The sensitivity test and subgroup analysis obtained consistent findings in the different sex and comorbidity subgroups. Conclusion Children\u2019s risk of JIA is higher if they have KD. Pediatricians should consider the possibility of JIA in this population. More investigations are necessary to identify the pathological mechanisms that link JIA and KD.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Differential diagnosis of the systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is often complicated, because of the variability in clinical presentation and the absence of specific signs. Material and methods The PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases from the years 2013\u20132022 were analysed for full articles in English and the following key words were used: \u201cjuvenile idiopathic arthritis\u201d and \u201cMIS-C\u201d; \u201cjuvenile idiopathic arthritis\u201d and \u201cKawasaki disease\u201d. As an example of the problem the case description of a 3-year-old patient is presented. Results In the first step 167 publications were identified; however, after exclusion of duplicated articles and those not relevant to the topic, only 13 were included in the analysis. We analysed studies that describe overlapping clinical features of sJIA and Kawasaki disease (KD) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The main issues we discussed were the search for the specific features that would distinguish one disease from another. Fever refractory to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was the most frequent indicator among the features of clinical courses. Among other clinical signs prolonged, recurrent fever, rash, an incomplete KD phenotype, Caucasian race, splenomegaly, and complicated macrophage activation syndrome also supported sJIA diagnosis. Among laboratory tests, high ferritin and serum interleukin-18 levels were found to be the most useful in differentiation. The present case demonstrates that prolonged, unexplained, recurrent fever with a specific pattern should be the reason to suspect sJIA. Conclusions Overlapping features of sJIA and SARS-CoV-2-related MIS-C complicates diagnosis in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our case presentation adds symptoms of prolonged, spiking, unexplained, recurrent fever with a specific pattern for supporting systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis diagnosis.",
