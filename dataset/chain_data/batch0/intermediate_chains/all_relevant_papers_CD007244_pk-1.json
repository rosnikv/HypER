        "title": "Exercise and osteoporosis-related fractures: perspectives and recommendations of the sports and exercise scientist.",
        "abstract": "Osteoporosis-related fractures represent a major health concern, particularly in elderly populations. Direct and indirect costs (amounting to nearly $17 billion in 2005), increased morbidity, and loss of independence place substantial burden on the health care system. Observational studies have shown that a physically active lifestyle is associated with a 30% to 50% decrease in vertebral or hip fractures, and a recent meta-analysis that determined the effects of exercise on fracture incidence further confirmed these results. However, because no randomized controlled exercise trials have selected fractures as a primary endpoint, causality between a sedentary lifestyle and fractures may be potentially confounded by participants' poor health status. With regard to fall reduction and bone strength as the main surrogates for fracture risk, many randomized controlled trials and corresponding meta-analyses have reported significant positive outcomes. Interestingly, no study that has assessed fall-related injuries has focused specifically on interventions that aimed to reduce fall impact. There is ongoing debate as to which factor, osteoporosis or falls, is more important for fracture prevention. This may be dependent on the region prone to fracture and the subjects' health status. In randomized controlled trials on exercise, the type, mode, and composition of exercise parameters are predictors of study outcome. Unfortunately, many exercise trials on fall prevention have not adequately described the exercise protocol used, which makes it difficult to determine which fall prevention protocol was most effective. A recent meta-analysis recommended Tai Chi and/or a mix of balance and resistance exercises for fall prevention. More sophisticated protocols are required to impact bone strength. Corresponding state-of-the-art protocols have focused on periodized high-impact/high-intensity resistance protocols performed at least twice per week. In the frail elderly, high-frequency/high-cycle number exercise programs with low-to-moderate strain intensity may also positively affect bone strength.",

        "explanation": "This paper discusses the relationship between exercise and osteoporosis-related fractures, but does not directly build upon the findings of the source paper. However, it does mention the importance of high-intensity resistance training, which is similar to the exercise program used in the source paper."

        "title": "Treating menopausal symptoms with a complex remedy or placebo: a randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a complex remedy compared with placebo to treat menopausal symptoms. Methods A total of 102 peri- and postmenopausal women requiring treatment for menopausal symptoms were randomized to receive a complex anthroposophic remedy prepared in the homeopathic manner (Apis regina tota GL D4, Argentum metallicum D5, Ovaria bovis GL D4), 3 \u00d7 10 globuli daily (2 \u00d7 12 weeks) and placebo (12 weeks) in different orders of remedy (R) and placebo (P) (1: R/R/P, 2: P/R/R, 3: R/P/R). The primary endpoint was change in climacteric symptoms assessed by the Menopause Rating Scale II (MRS II) after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes of symptoms and safety throughout the study. Results Reduction of symptoms after 12 weeks did not differ between remedy and placebo (total score MRS II: \u20131.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22122.8 to 0 vs. \u22122.3, 95% CI \u22124.4 to \u22120.3, p = 0.441) and had no clinical relevance (defined as reduction in MRS II \u2265 \u22123.5). Comparison of secondary outcomes at 12 weeks between remedy and placebo or between groups after the 2nd or 3rd period compared to previous periods did not differ. Treatment with remedy for 24 consecutive weeks did not reach clinical relevance either. However, total reduction of symptoms after three periods in Group 1 (R/R/P) (\u22125.0, 95% CI \u22127.5 to \u22122.5) and Group 2 (P/R/R) (\u22125.9, 95% CI \u22128.7 to \u22123.1) reached clinical relevance whereas almost no decrease of symptoms after three periods was seen in Group 3 (R/P/R) (\u22120.5, 95% CI \u22122.9 to 1.9). Conclusions Treatment with the complex remedy for 12 or 24 weeks did not result in clinically significant improvement of menopausal symptoms.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores a new angle of treating menopausal symptoms with a complex remedy, but does not directly build upon or use the findings of the source paper. However, it does investigate a related topic, and its findings could be seen as complementary to the source paper's results on the effects of Cimicifuga racemosa on menopausal symptoms."
