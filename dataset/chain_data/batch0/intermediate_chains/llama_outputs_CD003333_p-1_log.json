            "abstract": "Background\u2014 Chronic heart failure remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The role of antithrombotic therapy in patients with chronic heart failure has long been debated. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal antithrombotic agent for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fractions who are in sinus rhythm. Methods and Results\u2014 This prospective, randomized clinical trial of open-label warfarin (target international normalized ratio of 2.5 to 3.0) and double-blind treatment with either aspirin (162 mg once daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) had a 30-month enrollment period and a minimum of 12 months of treatment. We enrolled 1587 men and women \u226518 years of age with symptomatic heart failure for at least 3 months who were in sinus rhythm and had left ventricular ejection fraction of \u226435%. The primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. For the primary composite end point, the hazard ratios were as follows: for warfarin versus aspirin, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.12; P=0.77); for clopidogrel versus aspirin, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.40; P=0.57); and for warfarin versus clopidogrel, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16; P=0.39). Warfarin was associated with fewer nonfatal strokes than aspirin or clopidogrel. Hospitalization for worsening heart failure occurred in 116 (22.2%), 97 (18.5%), and 89 (16.5%) patients treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, respectively (P=0.02 for warfarin versus aspirin). Conclusion\u2014 The primary outcome measure and the mortality data do not support the primary hypotheses that warfarin is superior to aspirin and that clopidogrel is superior to aspirin.",

While HF increases the risk of mortality, stroke and thromboembolism in general, the \u2018extreme high-risk\u2019 nature of incident HF is perhaps under-recognised in everyday clinical practice. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Large Danish prospective epidemiological cohort. Participants Subjects in the Diet, Cancer and Health study. Outcome measures Stroke, death and the composite of \u2018stroke and death\u2019 among patients with incident cases of HF, without concomitant atrial fibrillation. Results From the original cohort, 1239 patients with incident HF were identified. Incidence rates show a higher incidence in the initial period following the diagnosis of HF, with a markedly higher rate of death and stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) in the initial 30\u2005days following the diagnosis of incident HF. While lower than the risk at 0\u201330\u2005days, the higher risk did not return to normal at 6+\u2005months after the diagnosis of incident HF. This risk increase was apparent for the end points of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic or both) whether or not a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was used. With VKA use, there was a lower adjusted HR for death and the composite of \u2018death or stroke\u2019 compared to non-VKA use at the three time intervals following diagnosis of HF, whether 0\u201330\u2005days, 30\u2005days to 6\u2005months and 6+ months. On multivariate analysis, previous stroke/transient ischaemic attack/thromboembolism was a predictor of higher risk of stroke, death and the composite of \u2018stroke and death\u2019, while VKA treatment was a highly significant predictor of a lower risk for death (adjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.74, p<0.001) and the combined end point of death or stroke (adjusted HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.96, p=0.003). Conclusions Based on relative hazards, incident HF is clearly a major risk factor for stroke, death and the composite of \u2018stroke and death\u2019, especially in the initial 30\u2005days following initial diagnosis. The use of VKA therapy was associated with a lower risk of these end points. These findings would have major implications for the approach to management of patients presenting with incident HF, given the high risk of this population for death and stroke, which may be ameliorated by VKA therapy.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rate of stroke in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved ejection fraction but without atrial fibrillation (AF), is uncertain as is whether it is possible to reliably predict the risk of stroke in these patients. METHODS: We validated a previously developed simple risk model for stroke among patients enrolled in the I-Preserve trial (Irbesartan in Heart Failure With Preserved Systolic Function) and PARAGON-HF trial (Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to Valsartan, on Morbidity and Mortality in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction). The risk model consisted of 3 variables: history of previous stroke, insulin-treated diabetes, and plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level. RESULTS: Of the 8924 patients included in the pooled trial dataset, 5126 patients did not have AF at baseline. Among patients without AF, 190 (3.7%) experienced a stroke over a median follow-up of 3.6 years (rate 10.5 per 1000 patient-years). The risk for stroke increased with increasing risk score: second tertile hazard ratio, 1.78 (95% CI, 1.17\u20132.71); third tertile hazard ratio, 3.03 (95% CI, 2.06\u20134.47), with the first tertile as reference. For patients in the third tertile, the occurrence rate of stroke was 17.7 per 1000 patient-years, similar to that in patients with AF not receiving anticoagulation (20.7 per 1000 patient-years), and those with AF who were receiving anticoagulation (14.5 per 1000 patient-years). Model discrimination was good with a C index of 0.81 (0.68\u20130.91) and a simple score could be created from the model. CONCLUSIONS: A simple risk model can detect a subset of HF and preserved ejection fraction patients without AF who have a higher risk for stroke. The balance of risk-to-benefit in these individuals may justify the use of prophylactic anticoagulation, but this hypothesis needs to be prospectively evaluated.

            "explanation": "This paper focuses on predicting stroke in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction without atrial fibrillation, which is closely related to the source paper's discussion on the CHA2DS2-VASc score and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The paper's hypothesis is at least partially dependent on the findings of the source paper, as it builds upon the idea of understanding heart failure and its relation to stroke risk."
