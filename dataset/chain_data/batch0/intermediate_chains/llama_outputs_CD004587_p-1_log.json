The primary endpoints were late lumen loss (LLL) and in-segment restenosis (ISR) after six months. Secondary endpoints were target vessel revascularisation after six and 24 months.

Among these, successful recanalization was obtained in 144 lesions (80.4%) with exclusive SES implantation in 104 lesions. The 9-12 months angiographic follow-up was executed in 85.5% of lesions with evidence of angiographic binary restenosis in 16.8% of lesions. Total stent length and number of stent implanted were recognized as independent predictors of restenosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-107.09, P = 0.02) and (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.39-23.55, P = 0.01), respectively.The 2-year clinical follow-up showed rates of target lesion revascularization, non-Q wave myocardial infarction, and total major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) of 11.1%, 2%, and 13.1%, respectively. Cox proportional-hazard analysis showed diabetes as independent predictor of MACEs (hazard ratio [HR] 4.832; 95% CI, 0.730-0.861; P = 0.028).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nData from this registry demonstrate the long-term efficacy and safety of SES implantation after complex CTOs recanalization.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nControlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART) or reverse CART techniques is the final step for percutaneous revascularization of coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO), but it still represents technical challenges and risk in interventional procedures.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nOur purpose was to utilize intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided reverse CART approach for percutaneous revascularization of CTO in our heart center, focusing on its safety, efficacy, and latest technical developments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom November 2006 to November 2012, 49 patients with CTO failed to antegrade and/or retrograde percutaneous revascularization of CTO from true lumen to true lumen were enrolled in and underwent IVUS guided reverse CART approach.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean J-CTO score of cases was 2.5. IVUS guidance was successfully implemented in 95.9%; IVUS identified that 61.7% of retrograde wires were located at intimal space, and 59.5% of antegrade wires were located at subintimal space. A Corsair channel dilator was used in 77.6% of cases. The success rates of technique and procedure were 95.9% and 93.9%, respectively; the technical minor complications were observed in 10.2% of cases, without significant clinic outcomes; 2.0% of cases occurred with a major adverse cardiac event of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; and no case occurred with target vessel revascularization or death. The mean length of stent implanted in a single CTO vessel was 51.3\u2009mm. No patient appeared with radiation dermatitis and contrast-induced rise of creatinine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIVUS guided reverse CART approach is effective and safe for percutaneous revascularization of complex CTO, with a high success and a low complication rate. It is feasible to develop this approach for percutaneous revascularization of complex CTO. However, suitable case selection and lately device handling by experienced operators are the crucial points of success.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nControlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART) or reverse CART techniques is the final step for percutaneous revascularization of coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO), but it still represents technical challenges and risk in interventional procedures.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nOur purpose was to utilize intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided reverse CART approach for percutaneous revascularization of CTO in our heart center, focusing on its safety, efficacy, and latest technical developments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom November 2006 to November 2012, 49 patients with CTO failed to antegrade and/or retrograde percutaneous revascularization of CTO from true lumen to true lumen were enrolled in and underwent IVUS guided reverse CART approach.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean J-CTO score of cases was 2.5. IVUS guidance was successfully implemented in 95.9%; IVUS identified that 61.7% of retrograde wires were located at intimal space, and 59.5% of antegrade wires were located at subintimal space. A Corsair channel dilator was used in 77.6% of cases. The success rates of technique and procedure were 95.9% and 93.9%, respectively; the technical minor complications were observed in 10.2% of cases, without significant clinic outcomes; 2.0% of cases occurred with a major adverse cardiac event of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; and no case occurred with target vessel revascularization or death. The mean length of stent implanted in a single CTO vessel was 51.3\u2009mm. No patient appeared with radiation dermatitis and contrast-induced rise of creatinine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIVUS guided reverse CART approach is effective and safe for percutaneous revascularization of complex CTO, with a high success and a low complication rate. It is feasible to develop this approach for percutaneous revascularization of complex CTO. However, suitable case selection and lately device handling by experienced operators are the crucial points of success.",

            "abstract": "The retrograde approach has revolutionized percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) by significantly improving success rates [1,2]. The retrograde approach involves two main steps: (a) delivering a guidewire and microcatheter distal to the occlusion via a collateral vessel and (b) crossing the CTO segment [2,3]. CTO crossing can be achieved using three techniques (Fig. 1a): (a) using the distal true lumen guidewire as a marker for antegrade guidewire crossing (\u201cjust marker\u201d and \u201ckissing wire\u201d techniques); (b) achieving \u201ctrue to true\u201d lumen crossing with the retrograde guidewire; or (c) using dissection/re-entry techniques, in which the guidewire is redirected from the subintimal space into the true lumen. There are two main dissection/re-entry techniques: in controlled antegrade and retrograde subintimal tracking (CART), a balloon is inflated over the retrograde guidewire allowing the antegrade guidewire to enter the distal true lumen. In reverse CART a balloon is inflated over the antegrade guidewire followed by retrograde guidewire crossing into the proximal true lumen using the space created by the antegrade balloon inflation. With the advent of the channel dilator (Corsair, Asahi Intecc, Nagoya, Japan), reverse CART is currently the most commonly utilized retrograde CTO crossing technique, since it is very common for the antegrade and retrograde guidewires to enter the subintimal space during CTO segment crossing attempts, especially in long occluded segments. Reverse CART also allows for wire externalization, which provides the strongest support for balloon/stent delivery. However, reverse CART may be difficult to perform, necessitating the development of several facilitating techniques. One such technique is the use of large balloons over the antegrade guidewire. Another technique is the use of intravascular ultrasonography, which allows better understanding of the spatial relationship between the antegrade and retrograde guidewires, plaque morphology, vessel size, and allows selection of suitable size balloon for subintimal space dilation [4]. Still, recoil of the subintimal space may occur, even when adequately sized balloons are used. To solve this problem, several additional techniques were developed. The \u201cstent reverse CART\u201d technique involves deploying a stent over the antegrade wire in the subintimal space to create a target for the retrograde wire. Deploying a snare in the antegrade subintimal space can prevent recoil and facilitate retrograde wire crossing into the antegrade true lumen. However, \u201cstent reverse CART\u201d cannot be reversed, i.e. a deployed stent cannot be retrieved and the use of a snare can be cumbersome and expensive. In this issue of the Journal, Mozid et al. describe a novel and elegant modification of reverse CART, the \u201cGuideliner reverse CART\u201d [5] (Fig. 1b). A guide catheter extension is advanced over the antegrade guidewire, creating a new \u201ctarget\u201d for the retrograde guidewire to enter. This technique can achieve re-entry faster and safer compared to the traditional reverse CART technique. For instance, reverse CART in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) can cause left main injury, which may compromise the left circumflex artery. By inserting a guide catheter extension into the proximal LAD, re-entry can be achieved safely without injuring the left main bifurcation. Furthermore, when performing reverse CART in distal vessels, i.e. the distal right coronary artery, it is sometimes very difficult or impossible for the retrograde",
