        "title": "Safety of downstream high-dose tirofiban bolus among 1578 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: the Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study",
        "abstract": "Background The Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study (SANTISS) is an open-label investigator-initiated single-centre registry launched to assess the combination of bleeding and access site in-hospital complications (primary end-point) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by femoral approach only. Methods We compared patients who were on oral single antiaggregating drug (AAD) and received, just prior to PCI, high-dose tirofiban and a second oral antiplatelet agent (triple AAD: group 1, n = 970) with those who were already on an oral double AAD regimen and did not receive tirofiban (double AAD: group 2, n = 608). Results Group 2 patients were slightly older, presented less frequently with unstable angina and had chronic renal failure more frequently. They were more than twice as frequently on rescue PCI, being more than three-fold less frequently on primary PCI (all: 0.01>P < 0.001). Overall, there were 87 in-hospital (average 4.7 days of stay) complications: 51 (5.3%) in group 1 and 36 (5.9%) in group 2 (not significant). Haemotransfusions were needed in 34 patients: 21 (2.2%) in group 1 and 13 (2.1%) in group 2 (not significant). Of the 16 hospital deaths, eight (0.8%) were seen in group 1 and eight (1.3%) in group 2 (not significant). Multivariate prediction showed a high predictive accuracy (areas under the curve >0.700) of female sex, rescue PCI and chronic renal failure to index complications, with highly significant odds ratios. The presence of high-dose tirofiban did not increase complication risk. Conclusion In the real world, high-dose tirofiban is well tolerated by patients on elective, primary or rescue PCI, and the in-hospital complication rate, including major bleeding, is low. This may have pharmacoeconomic consequences.",

        "explanation": "This paper investigates the safety of high-dose tirofiban bolus in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, which is partially dependent on the findings of the source paper regarding the efficacy of tirofiban in improving microvascular perfusion in diabetic patients. However, the focus of this paper is more on the safety aspect rather than the efficacy of tirofiban, and it does not directly build upon the source paper's hypothesis or findings. Therefore, the relevance score is 1."

        "title": "Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Antagonists in Acute Coronary Syndromes Undergoing PCI: A Long Way to Select Optimal Agent and Route",
        "abstract": "Antiplatelet treatment in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), without or with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), forces to keep the balance between potential threats and optimal clinical advantages. Apart from clopidogrel, glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab and 2 small molecules, tirofiban and eptifibatide) have come to the clinical scene. Recent evidence (2009\u20132011) is reviewed pointing to pharmacoeconometric considerations of concern in times of budget restrictions worldwide. In ACS, when clopidogrel plus aspirin are on, there might be no advantage to add small molecules. Whereas in STEMI patients treated by primary PCI, all 3\u2009GP IIb/IIIa antagonists might be superimposable, when only ACS is present and PCI is elective, definite distinction among the 3 agents, both pharmacoeconomically and pharmacodynamically, might be invoked. There are still points open to debate. Among these the route (upstream versus downstream) is still a matter of uncertainties. Moreover, theoretically, there might be differences not only between abciximab and small molecules (mostly superimposable) but also between tirofiban and eptifibatide (the former being potentially more potent). Thus, a long way is needed before a prominent agent among GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be selected. The game is still open, a role will be played soon by new agents.",

        "explanation": "This paper explores the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including tirofiban, in acute coronary syndromes undergoing PCI. While it does not directly build upon the source paper's findings, it discusses the pharmacoeconomic and pharmacodynamic considerations of using these inhibitors, which is related to the source paper's investigation of tirofiban's effects in diabetic patients undergoing elective PCI."
