Altogether sulfasalazine was significantly superior to placebo only concerning the IgA levels. The dropout rate was 47% for the sulfasalazine group and 19% for the placebo group. Due to side effects, 38% and 11%, respectively, stopped treatment. Ten other prospective, double-blind, controlled studies were analyzed. Altogether 959 patients with a mean disease duration of 13.9 years were evaluated. Most parameters did not improve significantly in the sulfasalazine groups compared to the placebo groups. Spinal motility remained nearly unchanged (0.3-3.5% improvement). Pain, morning stiffness, functional index, and global assessment were slightly influenced (1.9-11.7%). Reduction of ESR, CRP, IgA, IgG, and IgM was more distinct (12.6-20.3%). In 4 studies SSZ had greater efficacy in patients with peripheral joint involvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSulfasalazine has no clinically relevant benefit in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The dropout-rate due to adverse effects is high with a daily dose of 3 g. Sulfasalazine may be beneficial in peripheral joint involvement. Only few data exist about patients with a disease duration of less than 10 years.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: The clinical benefit of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) for treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is generally limited to improvements in peripheral arthritis. However, cDMARDs could be conditionally considered as alternatives to established drugs for improving axial manifestations in exceptional circumstances. However, there are few studies of the impact of cDMARDs on radiographic progression outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of cDMARDs on radiographic progression in AS. Methods: Among 1280 AS patients at a single hospital from 2000 to 2018, 301 who had been treated with sulfasalazine (SSZ) or methotrexate (MTX) were enrolled. For each patient, the entire follow-up period was split into 1-year intervals. Each interval was classified as either an \u201con-cDMARD\u201d interval, which was a period of treatment with SSZ alone, MTX alone, or a combination of SSZ and MTX, or an \u201coff-cDMARD\u201d interval, which was a period without cDMARD treatment. Radiographic progression was scored using the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS). The relationship between cDMARD use and radiographic progression within the intervals, defined as the rate of mSASSS progression, was investigated using linear models with adjustment for potential confounding covariates and for clustering among observations from the same patient. Results: The 732 on-cDMARD intervals and 1027 off-cDMARD intervals were obtained from enrolled patients. In multivariable regression analysis, there was no significant association between cDMARDs and the rate of mSASSS progression (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.081, p\u2009=\u20090.418). The mean adjusted mSASSS change per year was 0.610 from on-cDMARD intervals and 0.691 from off-cDMARD intervals. Conclusion: Treatment with cDMARDs may not reduce radiographic progression in AS patients.",

            "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate spinal radiographic progression in specific age ranges of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Methods: Longitudinal data for 1125 AS patients at a single hospital from 2000 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiographic intervals were obtained from patients with consecutive spinal radiographs. The radiographic progression rate was defined as the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) change per year within each interval. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), estimated marginal means were calculated for the mSASSS progression rate across age groups after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: We obtained 4016 radiographic intervals and stratified them into five groups based on patient age at the interval start: <20 (n\u2009=\u2009122); 20\u201329 (n\u2009=\u20091124); 30\u201339 (n\u2009=\u20091690); 40\u201349 (n\u2009=\u2009794); and \u2a7e50\u2009years (n\u2009=\u2009286). The mean (SD) mSASSS progression rate for all the intervals was 0.8 (1.9). The GEE-estimated mean mSASSS progression rate increased with age, peaking in the 30\u201339 age group with a value of 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.27], and decreased slightly thereafter. In the presence of risk factors, rapid progression occurred at earlier ages: the GEE-estimated mean mSASSS progression rate in those with elevated C-reactive protein levels and preexisting syndesmophytes was 2.82 (95% CI 1.93, 3.71) in the 20\u201329 age group. Conclusion: Spinal structural damage in AS seems to progress most rapidly when patients are age 30\u201339\u2009years. An awareness of the trends in radiographic progression with advancing age could improve understanding of the natural course of AS.",
