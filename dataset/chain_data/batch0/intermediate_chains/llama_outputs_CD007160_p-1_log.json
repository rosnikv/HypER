            "abstract": "Objective To assess the incidence and degree of hypoxaemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate the nation-wide perception and usage of oxygen therapy. Design Postal survey of all coronary care units (CCU) in England of their use of prescribed oxygen and pulse oximetry. Prospective randomised study of 50 patients presenting within 24 hours of onset of myocardial infarction, half of whom received oxygen therapy. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) as continuously measured by pulse oximetry, and arrhythmias and ST segment changes were recorded on simultaneous 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitors. Results In 53% of UK coronary care units oxygen is not routinely prescribed but in only 3% is a pulse oximeter used to aid management. In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction the incidence of hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 90%) was 70% and severe hypoxaemia 35% in those not given oxygen, compared with only 27% and 4% in patients given oxygen therapy. The only patient to receive oxygen on clinical grounds had an oxygen saturation of 71%. Severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 80%) occurred significantly less often (1 and 7 patients, p < 0.05) in patients given oxygen. There were no differences in arrhythmias or ST segment changes between groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemia occurs frequently in patients in the first 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction. It is effectively and easily treated with supplemental oxygen which can be guided by pulse oximetry. This is rarely done. Measurements of oxygen saturation are therefore justified in all patients to guide oxygen therapy unless there is a decision to give all patients supplemental oxygen: this we believe to be unnecessary.",

            "abstract": "Background A program of normothermic ex situ liver perfusion (NESLiP) was developed to facilitate better assessment and use of marginal livers, while minimizing cold ischemia. Methods Declined marginal livers and those offered for research were evaluated. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion was performed using an erythrocyte-based perfusate. Viability was assessed with reference to biochemical changes in the perfusate. Results Twelve livers (9 donation after circulatory death [DCD] and 3 from brain-dead donors), median Donor Risk Index 2.15, were subjected to NESLiP for a median 284 minutes (range, 122-530 minutes) after an initial cold storage period of 427 minutes (range, 222-877 minutes). The first 6 livers were perfused at high perfusate oxygen tensions, and the subsequent 6 at near-physiologic oxygen tensions. After transplantation, 5 of the first 6 recipients developed postreperfusion syndrome and 4 had sustained vasoplegia; 1 recipient experienced primary nonfunction in conjunction with a difficult explant. The subsequent 6 liver transplants, with livers perfused at lower oxygen tensions, reperfused uneventfully. Three DCD liver recipients developed cholangiopathy, and this was associated with an inability to produce an alkali bile during NESLiP. Conclusions Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion enabled assessment and transplantation of 12 livers that may otherwise not have been used. Avoidance of hyperoxia during perfusion may prevent postreperfusion syndrome and vasoplegia, and monitoring biliary pH, rather than absolute bile production, may be important in determining the likelihood of posttransplant cholangiopathy. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion has the potential to increase liver utilization, but more work is required to define factors predicting good outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Background A program of normothermic ex situ liver perfusion (NESLiP) was developed to facilitate better assessment and use of marginal livers, while minimizing cold ischemia. Methods Declined marginal livers and those offered for research were evaluated. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion was performed using an erythrocyte-based perfusate. Viability was assessed with reference to biochemical changes in the perfusate. Results Twelve livers (9 donation after circulatory death [DCD] and 3 from brain-dead donors), median Donor Risk Index 2.15, were subjected to NESLiP for a median 284 minutes (range, 122-530 minutes) after an initial cold storage period of 427 minutes (range, 222-877 minutes). The first 6 livers were perfused at high perfusate oxygen tensions, and the subsequent 6 at near-physiologic oxygen tensions. After transplantation, 5 of the first 6 recipients developed postreperfusion syndrome and 4 had sustained vasoplegia; 1 recipient experienced primary nonfunction in conjunction with a difficult explant. The subsequent 6 liver transplants, with livers perfused at lower oxygen tensions, reperfused uneventfully. Three DCD liver recipients developed cholangiopathy, and this was associated with an inability to produce an alkali bile during NESLiP. Conclusions Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion enabled assessment and transplantation of 12 livers that may otherwise not have been used. Avoidance of hyperoxia during perfusion may prevent postreperfusion syndrome and vasoplegia, and monitoring biliary pH, rather than absolute bile production, may be important in determining the likelihood of posttransplant cholangiopathy. Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion has the potential to increase liver utilization, but more work is required to define factors predicting good outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Normothermic ex situ liver perfusion might allow viability assessment of livers before transplantation. Perfusion characteristics were studied in 47 liver perfusions, of which 22 resulted in transplants. Hepatocellular damage was reflected in the perfusate transaminase concentrations, which correlated with posttransplant peak transaminase levels. Lactate clearance occurred within 3 hours in 46 of 47 perfusions, and glucose rose initially during perfusion in 44. Three livers required higher levels of bicarbonate support to maintain physiological pH, including one developing primary nonfunction. Bile production did not correlate with viability or cholangiopathy, but bile pH, measured in 16 of the 22 transplanted livers, identified three livers that developed cholangiopathy (peak pH < 7.4) from those that did not (pH > 7.5). In the 11 research livers where it could be studied, bile pH > 7.5 discriminated between the 6 livers exhibiting >50% circumferential stromal necrosis of septal bile ducts and 4 without necrosis; one liver with 25\u201050% necrosis had a maximum pH 7.46. Liver viability during normothermic perfusion can be assessed using a combination of transaminase release, glucose metabolism, lactate clearance, and maintenance of acid\u2010base balance. Evaluation of bile pH may offer a valuable insight into bile duct integrity and risk of posttransplant ischemic cholangiopathy.",

Perfusion characteristics were studied in 47 liver perfusions, of which 22 resulted in transplants. Hepatocellular damage was reflected in the perfusate transaminase concentrations, which correlated with posttransplant peak transaminase levels. Lactate clearance occurred within 3 hours in 46 of 47 perfusions, and glucose rose initially during perfusion in 44. Three livers required higher levels of bicarbonate support to maintain physiological pH, including one developing primary nonfunction. Bile production did not correlate with viability or cholangiopathy, but bile pH, measured in 16 of the 22 transplanted livers, identified three livers that developed cholangiopathy (peak pH < 7.4) from those that did not (pH > 7.5). In the 11 research livers where it could be studied, bile pH > 7.5 discriminated between the 6 livers exhibiting >50% circumferential stromal necrosis of septal bile ducts and 4 without necrosis; one liver with 25\u201050% necrosis had a maximum pH 7.46. Liver viability during normothermic perfusion can be assessed using a combination of transaminase release, glucose metabolism, lactate clearance, and maintenance of acid\u2010base balance. Evaluation of bile pH may offer a valuable insight into bile duct integrity and risk of posttransplant ischemic cholangiopathy.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate sequential hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) as a tool to resuscitate and assess viability of initially declined donor livers to enable safe transplantation.\n\n\nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA\nMachine perfusion is increasingly used to resuscitate and test the function of donor livers. Although (dual) hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion ([D]HOPE) resuscitates livers after cold storage, NMP enables assessment of hepatobiliary function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective clinical trial, nationwide declined livers were subjected to ex situ NMP (viability assessment phase), preceded by 1-hour DHOPE (resuscitation phase) and 1 hour of controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), using a perfusion fluid containing an hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. During the first 2.5\u200ahours of NMP, hepatobiliary viability was assessed, using predefined criteria: perfusate lactate <1.7 mmol/L, pH 7.35 to 7.45, bile production >10\u200amL, and bile pH >7.45. Livers meeting all criteria were accepted for transplantation. Primary endpoint was 3-month graft survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen livers underwent DHOPE-COR-NMP. All livers were from donors after circulatory death, with median age of 63 (range 42-82) years and median Eurotransplant donor risk index of 2.82. During NMP, all livers cleared lactate and produced sufficient bile volume, but in 5 livers bile pH remained <7.45. The 11 (69%) livers that met all viability criteria were successfully transplanted, with 100% patient and graft survival at 3 and 6 months. Introduction of DHOPE-COR-NMP increased the number of deceased donor liver transplants by 20%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSequential DHOPE-COR-NMP enabled resuscitation and safe selection of initially declined high-risk donor livers, thereby increasing the number of transplantable livers by 20%.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nwww.trialregister.nl; NTR5972.",

Although (dual) hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion ([D]HOPE) resuscitates livers after cold storage, NMP enables assessment of hepatobiliary function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective clinical trial, nationwide declined livers were subjected to ex situ NMP (viability assessment phase), preceded by 1-hour DHOPE (resuscitation phase) and 1 hour of controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), using a perfusion fluid containing an hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. During the first 2.5\u200ahours of NMP, hepatobiliary viability was assessed, using predefined criteria: perfusate lactate <1.7 mmol/L, pH 7.35 to 7.45, bile production >10\u200amL, and bile pH >7.45.

All livers were from donors after circulatory death, with median age of 63 (range 42-82) years and median Eurotransplant donor risk index of 2.82. During NMP, all livers cleared lactate and produced sufficient bile volume, but in 5 livers bile pH remained <7.45. The 11 (69%) livers that met all viability criteria were successfully transplanted, with 100% patient and graft survival at 3 and 6 months. Introduction of DHOPE-COR-NMP increased the number of deceased donor liver transplants by 20%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSequential DHOPE-COR-NMP enabled resuscitation and safe selection of initially declined high-risk donor livers, thereby increasing the number of transplantable livers by 20%.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nwww.trialregister.nl; NTR5972.",

            "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate peak serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and postoperative clinical outcomes after hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) versus static cold storage (SCS) in extended criteria donation (ECD) liver transplantation (LT) from donation after brain death (DBD). Background: HOPE might improve outcomes in LT, particularly in high-risk settings such as ECD organs after DBD, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, 46 patients undergoing ECD-DBD LT from four centers were randomly assigned to HOPE (n = 23) or SCS (n = 23). Peak-ALT levels within 7 days following LT constituted the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included incidence of postoperative complications [Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)], length of intensive care- (ICU) and hospital-stay, and incidence of early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Results: Demographics were equally distributed between both groups [donor age: 72 (IQR: 59\u201378) years, recipient age: 62 (IQR: 55\u201365) years, labMELD: 15 (IQR: 9\u201325), 38 male and 8 female recipients]. HOPE resulted in a 47% decrease in serum peak ALT [418 (IQR: 221\u2013828) vs 796 (IQR: 477\u20131195) IU/L, P = 0.030], a significant reduction in 90-day complications [44% vs 74% CD grade \u22653, P = 0.036; 32 (IQR: 12\u201356) vs 52 (IQR: 35\u201398) CCI, P = 0.021], and shorter ICU- and hospital-stays [5 (IQR: 4\u20138) vs 8 (IQR: 5\u201318) days, P = 0.045; 20 (IQR: 16\u201327) vs 36 (IQR: 23\u201362) days, P = 0.002] compared to SCS. A trend toward reduced EAD was observed for HOPE (17% vs 35%; P = 0.314). Conclusion: This multicenter RCT demonstrates that HOPE, in comparison to SCS, significantly reduces early allograft injury and improves post-transplant outcomes in ECD-DBD liver transplantation.",

            "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate peak serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and postoperative clinical outcomes after hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) versus static cold storage (SCS) in extended criteria donation (ECD) liver transplantation (LT) from donation after brain death (DBD). Background: HOPE might improve outcomes in LT, particularly in high-risk settings such as ECD organs after DBD, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, 46 patients undergoing ECD-DBD LT from four centers were randomly assigned to HOPE (n = 23) or SCS (n = 23). Peak-ALT levels within 7 days following LT constituted the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included incidence of postoperative complications [Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)], length of intensive care- (ICU) and hospital-stay, and incidence of early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Results: Demographics were equally distributed between both groups [donor age: 72 (IQR: 59\u201378) years, recipient age: 62 (IQR: 55\u201365) years, labMELD: 15 (IQR: 9\u201325), 38 male and 8 female recipients]. HOPE resulted in a 47% decrease in serum peak ALT [418 (IQR: 221\u2013828) vs 796 (IQR: 477\u20131195) IU/L, P = 0.030], a significant reduction in 90-day complications [44% vs 74% CD grade \u22653, P = 0.036; 32 (IQR: 12\u201356) vs 52 (IQR: 35\u201398) CCI, P = 0.021], and shorter ICU- and hospital-stays [5 (IQR: 4\u20138) vs 8 (IQR: 5\u201318) days, P = 0.045; 20 (IQR: 16\u201327) vs 36 (IQR: 23\u201362) days, P = 0.002] compared to SCS. A trend toward reduced EAD was observed for HOPE (17% vs 35%; P = 0.314). Conclusion: This multicenter RCT demonstrates that HOPE, in comparison to SCS, significantly reduces early allograft injury and improves post-transplant outcomes in ECD-DBD liver transplantation.",

Background: HOPE might improve outcomes in LT, particularly in high-risk settings such as ECD organs after DBD, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, 46 patients undergoing ECD-DBD LT from four centers were randomly assigned to HOPE (n = 23) or SCS (n = 23). Peak-ALT levels within 7 days following LT constituted the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included incidence of postoperative complications [Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)], length of intensive care- (ICU) and hospital-stay, and incidence of early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Results: Demographics were equally distributed between both groups [donor age: 72 (IQR: 59\u201378) years, recipient age: 62 (IQR: 55\u201365) years, labMELD: 15 (IQR: 9\u201325), 38 male and 8 female recipients]. HOPE resulted in a 47% decrease in serum peak ALT [418 (IQR: 221\u2013828) vs 796 (IQR: 477\u20131195) IU/L, P = 0.030], a significant reduction in 90-day complications [44% vs 74% CD grade \u22653, P = 0.036; 32 (IQR: 12\u201356) vs 52 (IQR: 35\u201398) CCI, P = 0.021], and shorter ICU- and hospital-stays [5 (IQR: 4\u20138) vs 8 (IQR: 5\u201318) days, P = 0.045; 20 (IQR: 16\u201327) vs 36 (IQR: 23\u201362) days, P = 0.002] compared to SCS. A trend toward reduced EAD was observed for HOPE (17% vs 35%; P = 0.314). Conclusion: This multicenter RCT demonstrates that HOPE, in comparison to SCS, significantly reduces early allograft injury and improves post-transplant outcomes in ECD-DBD liver transplantation.",

In this monocentric, open\u2010label study, from December 2018 to January 2021, 110 patients undergoing transplantation of an ECD liver graft were randomized to receive a liver after HOPE or after static cold storage (SCS) alone. The primary endpoint was the incidence of EAD. The secondary endpoints included graft and patient survival, the EASE risk score, and the rate of graft or other graft\u2010related complications. Patients in the HOPE group had a significantly lower rate of EAD (13% vs. 35%, p = .007) and were more frequently allocated to the intermediate or higher risk group according to the EASE score (2% vs. 11%, p = .05). The survival analysis confirmed that patients in the HOPE group were associated with higher graft survival one year after LT (p = .03, log\u2010rank test). In addition, patients in the SCS group had a higher re\u2010admission and overall complication rate at six months, in particular cardio\u2010vascular adverse events (p = .04 and p = .03, respectively). HOPE of ECD grafts compared to the traditional SCS preservation method is associated with lower dysfunction rates and better graft survival.",

            "title": "Effects of machine perfusion strategies on different donor types in liver transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
            "abstract": "Background: The increasing use of extended criteria donors (ECD) sets higher requirements for graft preservation. Machine perfusion (MP) improves orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) outcomes, but its effects on different donor types remains unclear. The authors\u2019 aim was to assess the effects of hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP), normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), or normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) versus static cold storage (SCS) on different donor types. Materials and methods: A literature search comparing the efficacy of MP versus SCS in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE database was conducted. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled effects of MP on ECD, donation after circulatory death (DCD), and donor after brainstem death. Results: Thirty nine studies were included (nine randomized controlled trials and 30 cohort studies). Compared with SCS, HMP significantly reduced the risk of non-anastomotic biliary stricture (NAS) [odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26\u20130.72], major complications (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39\u20130.78), and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.65) and improved 1-year graft survival (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.55\u20133.62) in ECD-OLT. HMP also reduced primary non-function (PNF) (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18\u20130.92) and acute rejection (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40\u20130.97). NMP only reduced major complications in ECD-OLT (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34\u20130.94), without favorable effects on other complications and survival. NRP lowered the overall risk of NAS (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11\u20130.68), PNF (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22\u20130.85), and EAD (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42\u20130.80) and meanwhile improved 1-year graft survival (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.65\u20133.49) in control DCD-OLT. Conclusions: HMP might currently be considered for marginal livers as it comprehensively improves ECD-OLT outcomes. NMP assists some outcomes in ECD-OLT, but more evidence regarding NMP-ECD is warranted. NRP significantly improves DCD-OLT outcomes and is recommended where longer non-touch periods exist.",
