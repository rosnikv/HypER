            "abstract": "Given that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) achieves its anti-hyperalgesia through endogenous opioid receptors, this study was undertaken to assess if TENS in combination with morphine was more effective at reducing primary hyperalgesia. Acute inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of 3% carrageenan into the rat's hindpaw. The withdrawal latency to heat and the mechanical withdrawal threshold were assessed before and after inflammation and after treatment with TENS (high- or low-frequency). Animals were divided into the following groups: Group 1, saline, no TENS; Group 2, high- or low-frequency TENS plus saline; Group 3, morphine (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), no TENS; and Group 4, high- or low-frequency TENS plus morphine (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, i.p.). There was an increase in inhibition of primary heat but not mechanical hyperalgesia after treatment with either high- or low-frequency TENS in combination with morphine. In combination with morphine, low-frequency TENS produced a similar reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia when compared with morphine alone. High-frequency TENS in combination with morphine produced a similar reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia when compared with the effects of high-frequency TENS alone. Thus, a lower dose of morphine could be used in combination with TENS to decrease the side effects of systemic morphine and achieve the same degree of analgesia.",

            "abstract": "Although transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used extensively in inflammatory joint conditions such as arthritis, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aims to demonstrate an opiate-mediated activation of descending inhibitory pathways from the rostral ventral medulla (RVM) in the antihyperalgesia produced by low- (4 Hz) or high-frequency (100 Hz) TENS. Paw withdrawal latency to radiant heat, as an index of secondary hyperalgesia, was recorded before and after knee joint inflammation (induced by intra-articular injection of 3% kaolin and carrageenan) and after TENS/no TENS coadministered with naloxone (20 microg/1 microl), naltrindole (5 microg/1 microl), or vehicle (1 microl) microinjected into the RVM. The selectivity of naloxone and naltrindole doses was tested against the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) (20 ng, 1 microl) and the delta2-opioid receptor agonist deltorphin (5 microg, 1 microl) in the RVM. Naloxone microinjection into the RVM blocks the antihyperalgesia produced by low frequency (p < 0.001), but not that produced by high-frequency TENS (p > 0.05). In contrast, naltrindole injection into the RVM blocks the antihyperalgesia produced by high-frequency (p < 0.05), but not low-frequency (p > 0.05) TENS. The analgesia produced by DAMGO and deltorphin is selectively blocked by naloxone (p < 0.05) and naltrindole (p < 0.05), respectively. Thus, the dose of naloxone and naltrindole used in the current study blocks mu- and delta-opioid receptors, respectively. Hence, low-frequency and high-frequency TENS produces antihyperalgesia by activation of mu- and delta-opioid receptors, respectively, in the RVM.",

TENS, with a modulated frequency, intensity as high as the subject could tolerate, and electrodes placed on either side and parallel to the incision, was compared to placebo TENS and pharmacologic analgesia alone (control) by using a crossover design. Self-report of pain intensity, walking function, and vital capacity were assessed on 33 subjects. TENS resulted in significantly less pain than the control during both walking (P <.5) and vital capacity activities (P <.1) and significantly less pain than placebo TENS during vital capacity (P <.01). TENS also produced significantly better gait speeds than the control (P <.05) and greater gait distances (P <.01) than the control and placebo TENS. Vital capacity and pain intensity at rest were not significantly different among the 3 treatments. These results suggest TENS reduces pain intensity during walking and deep breathing and increases walking function postoperatively when used as a supplement to pharmacologic analgesia. The lack of effect on pain at rest supports the hypothesis that TENS works through reducing hyperalgesia.",

TENS, with a modulated frequency, intensity as high as the subject could tolerate, and electrodes placed on either side and parallel to the incision, was compared to placebo TENS and pharmacologic analgesia alone (control) by using a crossover design. Self-report of pain intensity, walking function, and vital capacity were assessed on 33 subjects. TENS resulted in significantly less pain than the control during both walking (P <.5) and vital capacity activities (P <.1) and significantly less pain than placebo TENS during vital capacity (P <.01). TENS also produced significantly better gait speeds than the control (P <.05) and greater gait distances (P <.01) than the control and placebo TENS. Vital capacity and pain intensity at rest were not significantly different among the 3 treatments. These results suggest TENS reduces pain intensity during walking and deep breathing and increases walking function postoperatively when used as a supplement to pharmacologic analgesia. The lack of effect on pain at rest supports the hypothesis that TENS works through reducing hyperalgesia.",

            "abstract": "Background Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is commonly used for the management of pain; however, its effects on several pain and function measures are unclear. Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of high-frequency TENS (HF-TENS) and low-frequency TENS (LF-TENS) on several outcome measures (pain at rest, movement-evoked pain, and pain sensitivity) in people with knee osteoarthritis. Design The study was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Setting The setting was a tertiary care center. Participants Seventy-five participants with knee osteoarthritis (29 men and 46 women; 31\u201394 years of age) were assessed. Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive HF-TENS (100 Hz) (n=25), LF-TENS (4 Hz) (n=25), or placebo TENS (n=25) (pulse duration=100 microseconds; intensity=10% below motor threshold). Measurements The following measures were assessed before and after a single TENS treatment: cutaneous mechanical pain threshold, pressure pain threshold (PPT), heat pain threshold, heat temporal summation, Timed \u201cUp & Go\u201d Test (TUG), and pain intensity at rest and during the TUG. A linear mixed-model analysis of variance was used to compare differences before and after TENS and among groups (HF-TENS, LF-TENS, and placebo TENS). Results Compared with placebo TENS, HF-TENS and LF-TENS increased PPT at the knee; HF-TENS also increased PPT over the tibialis anterior muscle. There was no effect on the cutaneous mechanical pain threshold, heat pain threshold, or heat temporal summation. Pain at rest and during the TUG was significantly reduced by HF-TENS, LF-TENS, and placebo TENS. Limitations This study tested only a single TENS treatment. Conclusions Both HF-TENS and LF-TENS increased PPT in people with knee osteoarthritis; placebo TENS had no significant effect on PPT. Cutaneous pain measures were unaffected by TENS. Subjective pain ratings at rest and during movement were similarly reduced by active TENS and placebo TENS, suggesting a strong placebo component of the effect of TENS.",

            "abstract": "Background Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is commonly used for the management of pain; however, its effects on several pain and function measures are unclear. Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of high-frequency TENS (HF-TENS) and low-frequency TENS (LF-TENS) on several outcome measures (pain at rest, movement-evoked pain, and pain sensitivity) in people with knee osteoarthritis. Design The study was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Setting The setting was a tertiary care center. Participants Seventy-five participants with knee osteoarthritis (29 men and 46 women; 31\u201394 years of age) were assessed. Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive HF-TENS (100 Hz) (n=25), LF-TENS (4 Hz) (n=25), or placebo TENS (n=25) (pulse duration=100 microseconds; intensity=10% below motor threshold). Measurements The following measures were assessed before and after a single TENS treatment: cutaneous mechanical pain threshold, pressure pain threshold (PPT), heat pain threshold, heat temporal summation, Timed \u201cUp & Go\u201d Test (TUG), and pain intensity at rest and during the TUG. A linear mixed-model analysis of variance was used to compare differences before and after TENS and among groups (HF-TENS, LF-TENS, and placebo TENS). Results Compared with placebo TENS, HF-TENS and LF-TENS increased PPT at the knee; HF-TENS also increased PPT over the tibialis anterior muscle. There was no effect on the cutaneous mechanical pain threshold, heat pain threshold, or heat temporal summation. Pain at rest and during the TUG was significantly reduced by HF-TENS, LF-TENS, and placebo TENS. Limitations This study tested only a single TENS treatment. Conclusions Both HF-TENS and LF-TENS increased PPT in people with knee osteoarthritis; placebo TENS had no significant effect on PPT. Cutaneous pain measures were unaffected by TENS. Subjective pain ratings at rest and during movement were similarly reduced by active TENS and placebo TENS, suggesting a strong placebo component of the effect of TENS.",

            "abstract": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a nonpharmacological treatment for control of pain. It has come under much scrutiny lately with the Center for Medicare Services rendering a recent decision stating that \u201cTENS is not reasonable and necessary for the treatment of CLBP [chronic low back pain].\u201d When reading and analyzing the existing literature for which systematic reviews show that TENS is inconclusive or ineffective, it is clear that a number of variables related to TENS application have not been considered. Although many of the trials were designed with the highest of standards, recent evidence suggests that factors related to TENS application need to be considered in an assessment of efficacy. These factors include dosing of TENS, negative interactions with long-term opioid use, the population and outcome assessed, timing of outcome measurement, and comparison groups. The purpose of this perspective is to highlight and interpret recent evidence to help improve the design of clinical trials and the efficacy of TENS in the clinical setting.",

The patients had a 45-min transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation session with different experimental conditions: 80 Hz, 10 Hz, sham (presence of electrodes without stimulation), or control with no electrodes, immediately followed by five walking bouts on a treadmill until pain occurred. The patients were allowed to rest for 10 mins between each bout and had no feedback concerning the walking distance achieved. ResultsTotal walking distance was significantly different between T10, T80, sham, and control (P < 0.0003).
