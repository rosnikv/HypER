            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNational guidelines recommend consideration of step down or withdrawal of medication in patients with well-controlled hypertension, but knowledge of factors that predict or mediate success in achieving this goal is limited.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo identify patient characteristics associated with success in controlling blood pressure (BP) after withdrawal of antihypertensive medication.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly tested whether lifestyle interventions designed to promote weight loss or a reduced intake of sodium, alone or in combination, provided satisfactory BP control among elderly patients (aged 60-80 years) with hypertension after withdrawal from antihypertensive drug therapy. Participants were observed for 15 to 36 months after attempted drug withdrawal.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nTrial end points were defined by (1) a sustained BP of 150/90 mm Hg or higher, (2) a clinical cardiovascular event, or (3) a decision by participants or their personal physicians to resume BP medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProportional hazards regression analyses indicated that the hazard (+/- SE) of experiencing an end point among persons assigned to active interventions was 75% +/- 9% (weight loss), 68% +/- 7% (sodium reduction), and 55% +/- 7% (combined weight loss/sodium reduction) that of the hazard for those assigned to usual care. Lower baseline systolic BP (P < .001), fewer years since diagnosis of hypertension (P < .001), fewer years of antihypertensive treatment (P < .001), and no history of cardiovascular disease (P = .01) were important predictors of maintaining successful nonpharmacological BP control throughout follow-up, based on logistic regression analysis. Age, ethnicity, baseline level of physical activity baseline weight, medication class, smoking status, and alcohol intake were not statistically significant predictors. During follow-up, the extent of weight loss (P = .001) and urinary sodium excretion (P = .04) were associated with a reduction in the risk of trial end points in a graded fashion.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWithdrawal from antihypertensive medication is most likely to be successful in patients with well-controlled hypertension who have been recently (within 5 years) diagnosed or treated, and who adhere to life-style interventions involving weight loss and sodium reduction. More than 80% of these patients may have success in medication withdrawal for longer than 1 year.",

Participants (47% women, 23% African Americans) had systolic BP less than 145 mm Hg and diastolic BP less than 85 mm Hg while taking 1 antihypertensive medication.

Prior to medication withdrawal, mean reductions in systolic and diastolic BPs from the reduced sodium intervention, net of control, were 4.3 mm Hg (P<.001) and 2.0 mm Hg (P =.001).

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRestricting sodium intake in elevated blood pressure over short periods of time reduces blood pressure. Long term effects (on mortality, morbidity or blood pressure) of advice to reduce salt in patients with elevated or normal blood pressure are unclear.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess in adults the long term effects (mortality, cardiovascular events, blood pressure, quality of life, weight, urinary sodium excretion, other nutrients and use of anti-hypertensive medications) of advice to restrict dietary sodium using all relevant randomised controlled trials.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies of included studies and related systematic reviews were searched for unconfounded randomised trials in healthy adults aiming to reduce sodium intake over at least 6 months. Attempts were made to trace unpublished or missed studies and authors of all included trials were contacted. There were no language restrictions.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nInclusion decisions were independently duplicated and based on the following criteria: 1) randomisation was adequate; 2) there was a usual or control diet group; 3) the intervention aimed to reduce sodium intake; 4) the intervention was not multifactorial; 5) the participants were not children, acutely ill, pregnant or institutionalised; 6) follow-up was at least 26 weeks; 7) data on any of the outcomes of interest were available.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nDecisions on validity and data extraction were made independently by two reviewers, disagreements were resolved by discussion or if necessary by a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analysis, sub-grouping, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were performed.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThree trials in normotensives (n=2326), five in untreated hypertensives (n=387) and three in treated hypertensives (n=801) were included, with follow up from six months to seven years. The large, high quality (and therefore most informative) studies used intensive behavioural interventions. Deaths and cardiovascular events were inconsistently defined and reported; only 17 deaths equally distributed between intervention and control groups occurred. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced at 13 to 60 months in those given low sodium advice as compared with controls (systolic by 1.1 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.8 to 0.4, diastolic by 0.6 mm hg, 95% CI 1.5 to -0.3), as was urinary 24 hour sodium excretion (by 35.5 mmol/ 24 hours, 95% CI 47.2 to 23.9). Degree of reduction in sodium intake and change in blood pressure were not related. People on anti-hypertensive medications were able to stop their medication more often on a reduced sodium diet as compared with controls, while maintaining similar blood pressure control.\n\n\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS\nIntensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. Further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. Evidence from a large and small trial showed that a low sodium diet helps in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. If this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.",
