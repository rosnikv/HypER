RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Pregnancy outcomes were assessed prospectively in 725 women with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes and Pre-eclampsia Intervention Trial. HbA1c (A1C) values at 26 and 34 weeks\u2019 gestation were categorized into five groups, the lowest, <6.0% (42 mmol/mol), being the reference. Average pre- and postprandial results from an eight-point capillary glucose profile the previous day were categorized into five groups, the lowest (preprandial <5.0 mmol/L and postprandial <6.0 mmol/L) being the reference. RESULTS An A1C of 6.0\u20136.4% (42\u201347 mmol/mol) at 26 weeks\u2019 gestation was associated with a significantly increased risk of large for gestational age (LGA) (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0\u20133.0]) and an A1C of 6.5\u20136.9% (48\u201352 mmol/mol) with a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.3\u20134.8]), pre-eclampsia (4.3 [1.7\u201310.8]), need for a neonatal glucose infusion (2.9 [1.5\u20135.6]), and a composite adverse outcome (3.2 [1.3\u20138.0]). These risks increased progressively with increasing A1C. Results were similar at 34 weeks\u2019 gestation. Glucose data showed less consistent trends, although the risk of a composite adverse outcome increased with preprandial glucose levels between 6.0 and 6.9 mmol/L at 34 weeks (3.3 [1.3\u20138.0]). CONCLUSIONS LGA increased significantly with an A1C \u22656.0 (42 mmol/mol) at 26 and 34 weeks' gestation and with other adverse outcomes with an A1C \u22656.5% (48 mmol/mol). The data suggest that there is clinical utility in regular measurement of A1C during pregnancy.",

Linear regression was used to assess their association with NBWs z-scores adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). +NH was defined by a note in the infant record, glucose <1.7 mmol/L in the first 24 h, or <2.5 mmol/L in the first 48 h after birth. A t test or Welch's approximate t test was used to compare the mean 1,5-AG and A1C of mothers with +NH versus those without (-NH), adjusted for gestational age and analyzed by diabetes type and across trimesters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean 1,5-AG significantly differed across groups: T1DM 3.77 \u00b1 2.82 \u03bcg/mL, T2DM 5.73 \u00b1 4.38 \u03bcg/mL, GDM 8.89 \u00b1 4.39 \u03bcg/mL (P<.0001), suggesting less glucose exposure in GDM relative to T1DM or T2DM. A negative linear association was found between mean 1,5-AG and z-scores (R= -0.28, P = .005. In contrast, the association between mean A1C and z-scores was weaker (R = 0.15, P = .14). The mean 1,5-AG tended to be lower in the +NH cohort versus -NH (P = .08), and this was statistically significant (P = .01) among subjects with GDM.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe association of 1,5-AG with complications related to glycemic exposure supports the notion of its utility as an adjunct glycemic biomarker in pregnancies complicated by diabetes and across trimesters.",

Linear regression was used to assess their association with NBWs z-scores adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). +NH was defined by a note in the infant record, glucose <1.7 mmol/L in the first 24 h, or <2.5 mmol/L in the first 48 h after birth. A t test or Welch's approximate t test was used to compare the mean 1,5-AG and A1C of mothers with +NH versus those without (-NH), adjusted for gestational age and analyzed by diabetes type and across trimesters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean 1,5-AG significantly differed across groups: T1DM 3.77 \u00b1 2.82 \u03bcg/mL, T2DM 5.73 \u00b1 4.38 \u03bcg/mL, GDM 8.89 \u00b1 4.39 \u03bcg/mL (P<.0001), suggesting less glucose exposure in GDM relative to T1DM or T2DM.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides robust data about short-term glycemic control and provides metrics such as percent time-in-range (%TIR) that are now routinely reported to describe the change in glycemic control after an intervention in a clinical study or a change in therapy in a patient's care. Recent studies have shown that %TIR may have similar associations with diabetes microvascular complications as does HbA1C. The relationship of %TIR to the long-standing metric of overall glycemic control has not been clearly defined to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nArticles that report paired HbA1C and %TIR metrics (n\u2009=\u20091137) or HbA1C and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (n\u2009=\u20091440) across a wide range of HbA1Cs, technologies, and subject demographics were reviewed to determine the correlation of these metrics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSelected paired HbA1C and %TIR data from 18 articles were evaluated by linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. There was an excellent correlation between the two (R\u2009=\u2009-0.84; R2\u2009=\u20090.71).

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides robust data about short-term glycemic control and provides metrics such as percent time-in-range (%TIR) that are now routinely reported to describe the change in glycemic control after an intervention in a clinical study or a change in therapy in a patient's care. Recent studies have shown that %TIR may have similar associations with diabetes microvascular complications as does HbA1C. The relationship of %TIR to the long-standing metric of overall glycemic control has not been clearly defined to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nArticles that report paired HbA1C and %TIR metrics (n\u2009=\u20091137) or HbA1C and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (n\u2009=\u20091440) across a wide range of HbA1Cs, technologies, and subject demographics were reviewed to determine the correlation of these metrics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSelected paired HbA1C and %TIR data from 18 articles were evaluated by linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. There was an excellent correlation between the two (R\u2009=\u2009-0.84; R2\u2009=\u20090.71).

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides robust data about short-term glycemic control and provides metrics such as percent time-in-range (%TIR) that are now routinely reported to describe the change in glycemic control after an intervention in a clinical study or a change in therapy in a patient's care. Recent studies have shown that %TIR may have similar associations with diabetes microvascular complications as does HbA1C. The relationship of %TIR to the long-standing metric of overall glycemic control has not been clearly defined to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nArticles that report paired HbA1C and %TIR metrics (n\u2009=\u20091137) or HbA1C and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (n\u2009=\u20091440) across a wide range of HbA1Cs, technologies, and subject demographics were reviewed to determine the correlation of these metrics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSelected paired HbA1C and %TIR data from 18 articles were evaluated by linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. There was an excellent correlation between the two (R\u2009=\u2009-0.84; R2\u2009=\u20090.71).

DATA SOURCES Many electronic databases were searched for articles published from inception until 30 June 2019. STUDY SELECTION We selected RCTs that assessed both changes in HbA1c and time in target range (TIR), together with time below range (TBR), time above range (TAR), and glucose variability expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted from each trial by two investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS All results were analyzed by a random effects model to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with the 95% CI. We identified 15 RCTs, lasting 12\u201336 weeks and involving 2,461 patients. Compared with the usual care (overall data), CGM was associated with modest reduction in HbA1c (WMD \u22120.17%, 95% CI \u22120.29 to \u22120.06, I2 = 96.2%), increase in TIR (WMD 70.74 min, 95% CI 46.73\u201394.76, I2 = 66.3%), and lower TAR, TBR, and CV, with heterogeneity between studies. The increase in TIR was significant and robust independently of diabetes type, method of insulin delivery, and reason for CGM use. In preplanned subgroup analyses, real-time CGM led to the higher improvement in mean HbA1c (WMD \u22120.23%, 95% CI \u22120.36 to \u22120.10, P < 0.001), TIR (WMD 83.49 min, 95% CI 52.68\u2013114.30, P < 0.001), and TAR, whereas both intermittently scanned CGM and sensor-augmented pump were associated with the greater decline in TBR.

PURPOSE We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CGM with usual care for parameters of glycemic control in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES Many electronic databases were searched for articles published from inception until 30 June 2019. STUDY SELECTION We selected RCTs that assessed both changes in HbA1c and time in target range (TIR), together with time below range (TBR), time above range (TAR), and glucose variability expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted from each trial by two investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS All results were analyzed by a random effects model to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with the 95% CI. We identified 15 RCTs, lasting 12\u201336 weeks and involving 2,461 patients. Compared with the usual care (overall data), CGM was associated with modest reduction in HbA1c (WMD \u22120.17%, 95% CI \u22120.29 to \u22120.06, I2 = 96.2%), increase in TIR (WMD 70.74 min, 95% CI 46.73\u201394.76, I2 = 66.3%), and lower TAR, TBR, and CV, with heterogeneity between studies. The increase in TIR was significant and robust independently of diabetes type, method of insulin delivery, and reason for CGM use. In preplanned subgroup analyses, real-time CGM led to the higher improvement in mean HbA1c (WMD \u22120.23%, 95% CI \u22120.36 to \u22120.10, P < 0.001), TIR (WMD 83.49 min, 95% CI 52.68\u2013114.30, P < 0.001), and TAR, whereas both intermittently scanned CGM and sensor-augmented pump were associated with the greater decline in TBR. LIMITATIONS Heterogeneity was high for most of the study outcomes; all studies were sponsored by industry, had short duration, and used an open-label design. CONCLUSIONS CGM improves glycemic control by expanding TIR and decreasing TBR, TAR, and glucose variability in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

A total of 41\u202f753 participants with insulin-treated diabetes (5673 type 1; 36\u202f080 type 2) receiving care from a Northern California integrated health care delivery system (2014-2019), being treated with insulin, self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, and having no prior CGM use were included.\n\n\nExposures\nInitiation vs noninitiation of real-time CGM (reference group).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nTen end points measured during the 12 months before and 12 months after baseline: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); hypoglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); hyperglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); HbA1c levels lower than 7%, lower than 8%, and higher than 9%; 1 emergency department encounter or more for any reason; 1 hospitalization or more for any reason; and number of outpatient visits and telephone visits.\n\n\nResults\nThe real-time CGM initiators included 3806 patients (mean age, 42.4 years [SD, 19.9 years]; 51% female; 91% type 1, 9% type 2); the noninitiators included 37\u202f947 patients (mean age, 63.4 years [SD, 13.4 years]; 49% female; 6% type 1, 94% type 2). The prebaseline mean HbA1c was lower among real-time CGM initiators than among noninitiators, but real-time CGM initiators had higher prebaseline rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c declined among real-time CGM initiators from 8.17% to 7.76% and from 8.28% to 8.19% among noninitiators (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.48% to -0.32%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Hypoglycemia rates declined among real-time CGM initiators from 5.1% to 3.0% and increased among noninitiators from 1.9% to 2.3% (difference-in-differences estimate, -2.7%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -1.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.001). There were also statistically significant differences in the adjusted net changes in the proportion of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 7.1% to 12.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower than 8% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 13.1%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 16.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and higher than 9% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -7.1%; 95% CI, -9.5% to -4.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and in the number of outpatient visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and telephone visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Initiation of real-time CGM was not associated with statistically significant changes in rates of hyperglycemia, emergency department visits for any reason, or hospitalizations for any reason.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this retrospective cohort study, insulin-treated patients with diabetes selected by physicians for real-time continuous glucose monitoring compared with noninitiators had significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and reductions in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia, but no significant change in emergency department visits or hospitalizations for hyperglycemia or for any reason.

A total of 41\u202f753 participants with insulin-treated diabetes (5673 type 1; 36\u202f080 type 2) receiving care from a Northern California integrated health care delivery system (2014-2019), being treated with insulin, self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, and having no prior CGM use were included.\n\n\nExposures\nInitiation vs noninitiation of real-time CGM (reference group).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nTen end points measured during the 12 months before and 12 months after baseline: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); hypoglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); hyperglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); HbA1c levels lower than 7%, lower than 8%, and higher than 9%; 1 emergency department encounter or more for any reason; 1 hospitalization or more for any reason; and number of outpatient visits and telephone visits.\n\n\nResults\nThe real-time CGM initiators included 3806 patients (mean age, 42.4 years [SD, 19.9 years]; 51% female; 91% type 1, 9% type 2); the noninitiators included 37\u202f947 patients (mean age, 63.4 years [SD, 13.4 years]; 49% female; 6% type 1, 94% type 2). The prebaseline mean HbA1c was lower among real-time CGM initiators than among noninitiators, but real-time CGM initiators had higher prebaseline rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c declined among real-time CGM initiators from 8.17% to 7.76% and from 8.28% to 8.19% among noninitiators (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.48% to -0.32%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Hypoglycemia rates declined among real-time CGM initiators from 5.1% to 3.0% and increased among noninitiators from 1.9% to 2.3% (difference-in-differences estimate, -2.7%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -1.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.001). There were also statistically significant differences in the adjusted net changes in the proportion of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 7.1% to 12.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower than 8% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 13.1%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 16.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and higher than 9% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -7.1%; 95% CI, -9.5% to -4.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and in the number of outpatient visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and telephone visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

            "abstract": "Importance\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes; observational evidence for CGM in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes is lacking.\n\n\nObjective\nTo estimate clinical outcomes of real-time CGM initiation.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nExploratory retrospective cohort study of changes in outcomes associated with real-time CGM initiation, estimated using a difference-in-differences analysis. A total of 41\u202f753 participants with insulin-treated diabetes (5673 type 1; 36\u202f080 type 2) receiving care from a Northern California integrated health care delivery system (2014-2019), being treated with insulin, self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, and having no prior CGM use were included.\n\n\nExposures\nInitiation vs noninitiation of real-time CGM (reference group).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nTen end points measured during the 12 months before and 12 months after baseline: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); hypoglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); hyperglycemia (emergency department or hospital utilization); HbA1c levels lower than 7%, lower than 8%, and higher than 9%; 1 emergency department encounter or more for any reason; 1 hospitalization or more for any reason; and number of outpatient visits and telephone visits.\n\n\nResults\nThe real-time CGM initiators included 3806 patients (mean age, 42.4 years [SD, 19.9 years]; 51% female; 91% type 1, 9% type 2); the noninitiators included 37\u202f947 patients (mean age, 63.4 years [SD, 13.4 years]; 49% female; 6% type 1, 94% type 2). The prebaseline mean HbA1c was lower among real-time CGM initiators than among noninitiators, but real-time CGM initiators had higher prebaseline rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c declined among real-time CGM initiators from 8.17% to 7.76% and from 8.28% to 8.19% among noninitiators (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.48% to -0.32%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Hypoglycemia rates declined among real-time CGM initiators from 5.1% to 3.0% and increased among noninitiators from 1.9% to 2.3% (difference-in-differences estimate, -2.7%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -1.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.001). There were also statistically significant differences in the adjusted net changes in the proportion of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 7.1% to 12.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower than 8% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 13.1%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 16.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and higher than 9% (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -7.1%; 95% CI, -9.5% to -4.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and in the number of outpatient visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and telephone visits (adjusted difference-in-differences estimate, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Initiation of real-time CGM was not associated with statistically significant changes in rates of hyperglycemia, emergency department visits for any reason, or hospitalizations for any reason.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this retrospective cohort study, insulin-treated patients with diabetes selected by physicians for real-time continuous glucose monitoring compared with noninitiators had significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c and reductions in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia, but no significant change in emergency department visits or hospitalizations for hyperglycemia or for any reason. Because of the observational study design, findings may have been susceptible to selection bias.",
